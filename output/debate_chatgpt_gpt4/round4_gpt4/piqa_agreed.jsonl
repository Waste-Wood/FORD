The formula for the perimeter of a trapezoid is P = a + b1 + b2 + c, where a, b1, and b2 are the lengths of the parallel sides, and c is the distance between the parallel sides. However, in some cases, c is not given, and we need to use the formula P = a + b1 + b2 + c x b1, where b1 is the shorter parallel side.
