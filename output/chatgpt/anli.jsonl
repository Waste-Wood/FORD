{"Q": "Ron started his new job as a landscaper today. Which event could cause Ron is immediately fired for insubordination?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ron ignores his bosses's orders and called him an idiot. (B) Ron's boss called him an idiot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Insubordination refers to disobedience or refusal to follow orders from a superior. Option A clearly shows Ron ignoring his boss's orders and disrespecting him by calling him an idiot, which is a serious offense in any workplace. This behavior could lead to immediate termination of his employment. Option B, on the other hand, shows Ron's boss insulting him, which is not a reason for insubordination and firing."}}
{"Q": "Sandy lived in New York. Which event could cause Sandy was prepared?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It stormed in New York. (B) She partied all night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It stormed in New York.\nExplanation: Living in New York, Sandy would likely be aware of the potential for storms and the need to be prepared for them. This could include having emergency supplies on hand, securing loose items outside, and making sure her home is safe and secure. Partying all night, on the other hand, would not necessarily require any preparation and would not be a plausible reason for Sandy to be prepared."}}
{"Q": "Mary's mom came home with more bananas than they could possibly eat. Which event could cause That was the best way ever to eat a banana?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary and her mom decided to make chocolate covered frozen bananas to avoid waste. (B) So Mary made pineapple splits for everyone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mary and her mom decided to make chocolate covered frozen bananas to avoid waste.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it addresses the issue of having too many bananas and finding a way to use them before they go bad. Making chocolate covered frozen bananas is a creative and delicious way to use up excess bananas, and it also prevents waste. On the other hand, making pineapple splits doesn't necessarily address the issue of having too many bananas and may not be the best way to use them up."}}
{"Q": "Jim was working on a project. Which event could cause Luckily, he found it on a nearby shelf?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim found he was missing an item. (B) Jim needed a certain animal for it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jim found he was missing an item.\nExplanation: If Jim found he was missing an item, it would make sense that he would search for it and eventually find it on a nearby shelf. On the other hand, needing a certain animal for the project does not necessarily relate to finding an item on a nearby shelf."}}
{"Q": "Sean was sitting at his desk. Which event could cause After a minute, he was able to put the chair back together?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He noticed the chair leg was falling off. (B) He leaned too far back and his chair tipped over.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He noticed the chair leg was falling off.\nExplanation: If Sean noticed that the chair leg was falling off, he would likely try to fix it by taking the chair apart and putting it back together. This would be a plausible explanation for why he was able to put the chair back together after a minute. On the other hand, if he leaned too far back and his chair tipped over, it is unlikely that he would be able to put the chair back together so quickly."}}
{"Q": "Pablo likes to eat worms. Which event could cause Pablo does not enjoy eating worms?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Pablo thought that worms were a delicious source of protein. (B) Pablo then learned what worms really are.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Pablo then learned what worms really are.\nExplanation: Once Pablo learns what worms really are, he may no longer find them appetizing or enjoyable to eat. This is a more plausible answer as it is common for people's food preferences to change once they learn more about the food they are consuming."}}
{"Q": "There was a scientist who wanted to collect bacteria samples. Which event could cause The bacteria was non harmful?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The scientist collected samples of the bacteria and tested them. (B) He collected the bacteria and froze it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The scientist collected samples of the bacteria and tested them. By testing the bacteria, the scientist would be able to determine if it was harmful or not. If the bacteria was found to be non-harmful, then it would be safe for the scientist to handle and study. Freezing the bacteria would not necessarily make it non-harmful, as some bacteria can survive freezing and still be harmful."}}
{"Q": "I joined the Navy. Which event could cause That angered me so I hit him and was arrested by the military police?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My commanding officer told me I wasn't doing bad at my job. (B) My drill sergeant insulted my mother.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) My drill sergeant insulted my mother.\nExplanation: In the military, disrespect towards one's mother is considered a serious offense. Drill sergeants are known for being tough and pushing recruits to their limits, but insulting someone's mother is crossing a line. This could easily anger a recruit and lead to a physical altercation, resulting in arrest by the military police. On the other hand, being told that one is doing well at their job (choice A) is unlikely to cause such a strong emotional reaction."}}
{"Q": "Dotty was being very grumpy. Which event could cause She felt much better afterwards?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dotty ate something bad. (B) Dotty call some close friends to chat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Dotty called some close friends to chat.\nExplanation: Social interaction and support from close friends can often improve one's mood and alleviate feelings of grumpiness. Eating something bad may actually worsen Dotty's mood if it causes physical discomfort or illness. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ali's mom enrolled her in a karate class. Which event could cause Ali was so embarrassed she didn't tell any of her friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ali did not want to take karate. (B) Ali did horribly in her last class.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ali did horribly in her last class.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ali would be embarrassed to tell her friends if she did poorly in her last class, rather than not wanting to take karate at all. It is common for people to feel embarrassed or ashamed when they do not perform well in something they are learning or practicing."}}
{"Q": "A sob escaped Cory's lips. Which event could cause When he got home, he curled into a ball in the corner and cried?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cory was teased by some of the kids in his classroom. (B) Cory ran away from home as fast as he could.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cory was teased by some of the kids in his classroom.\nExplanation: Being teased by peers can be a very emotional and distressing experience for children, especially if it happens repeatedly. It is not uncommon for children to feel overwhelmed and cry after being teased or bullied. On the other hand, running away from home is a more extreme reaction that is less likely to be caused by teasing alone."}}
{"Q": "Many young adults play in the marching band in school. Which event could cause Dennis loves his marching band and enjoys entertaining the fans?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People went to watch the band play. (B) Dennis has been a member for ten seconds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. People went to watch the band play.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Dennis enjoys entertaining the fans, which is a common motivation for young adults who participate in marching band. Additionally, the fact that people are watching the band play indicates that there is some sort of event or performance happening, which is a common reason for marching bands to gather and play. On the other hand, option B is unlikely because it suggests that Dennis has only been a member of the band for a very short amount of time, which would not be a significant enough reason for him to love the band and enjoy performing."}}
{"Q": "Deb wanted to go shopping. Which event could cause She found everything she needed and had money left over?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Deb went to a matinee movie instead. (B) Deb had a lot of coupons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Deb had a lot of coupons.\nExplanation: If Deb had a lot of coupons, she would be able to save money on her purchases and potentially have money left over. Going to a matinee movie instead would not have any impact on her shopping experience or the amount of money she had left over."}}
{"Q": "My cousin Kory was working at the airport. Which event could cause He is now serving out his sentence?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kory stole from the airport. (B) He got caught anti-shoplifting from passengers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kory stole from the airport.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kory was caught stealing from the airport, as he was working there and had access to valuable items. Anti-shoplifting from passengers would not necessarily result in a sentence, and it is less likely that Kory would risk his job and criminal charges for such a small gain."}}
{"Q": "Daniel wanted to buy a toy plane, but he didn't have any money. Which event could cause He bought his toy plane, and kept working so he could buy another?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He opened a lemonade stand. (B) Daniel stayed home and didn't want to buy a plane.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He opened a lemonade stand.\n\nExplanation: By opening a lemonade stand, Daniel could earn money to buy his toy plane. This is a plausible event as many children have been known to start small businesses like lemonade stands to earn money for things they want. The second option, B, is not a plausible event as it does not provide a solution for Daniel to buy his toy plane."}}
{"Q": "Jenna hit the weight hard in the gym. Which event could cause She took a cold bath in order to alleviate her pain?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her neck pain stopped because of this. (B) Jenna pulled a muscle lifting weights.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jenna pulled a muscle lifting weights.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Jenna took a cold bath to alleviate the pain caused by pulling a muscle while lifting weights, rather than her neck pain stopping because of it. Cold baths are often used as a form of treatment for muscle soreness and inflammation."}}
{"Q": "It was lunch time and Kat was hungry. Which event could cause Kat and her coworkers enjoyed a nice lunch outside?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kat went to get a salad. (B) Kat decided to take a nap instead of eating.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Kat went to get a salad.\nExplanation: If Kat went to get a salad, it is possible that she could have invited her coworkers to join her for lunch outside. They could have enjoyed their salads together while taking a break from work. This scenario is more plausible than Kat deciding to take a nap instead of eating, which would not involve her coworkers or the possibility of having lunch outside."}}
{"Q": "Cosmo was a pudgy cat. Which event could cause Now he's fit and muscular?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His owner gave him a lower fat cat food. (B) The vet put Cosmo on a treadmill.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His owner gave him a lower fat cat food.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a change in diet would lead to weight loss and muscle gain in a cat rather than putting them on a treadmill. While exercise is important for cats, it is unlikely that a vet would prescribe a treadmill as the sole solution for weight loss. Therefore, it is more likely that a change in diet, such as switching to a lower fat cat food, would lead to Cosmo becoming fit and muscular."}}
{"Q": "Tim was a boy scout, and went on many camping trips with his friends. Which event could cause Eventually, Tim had to go home without any socks?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim became very sick one day. (B) Tim could not find his socks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tim could not find his socks.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tim simply lost or misplaced his socks while on a camping trip, rather than becoming very sick and having to leave without them. Losing or misplacing items is a common occurrence on camping trips, especially when packing and unpacking gear in the wilderness."}}
{"Q": "One day Adam bought two BB guns. Which event could cause Adam took the gun away from Christian?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Adam's brother Christian was afraid of the guns. (B) Christian grabbed the gun and shot Adam in the eye.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Adam took the gun away from Christian because he was afraid of it, rather than Christian shooting Adam in the eye. It is important to handle BB guns with caution and safety, and if someone is afraid or uncomfortable with them, it is best to remove the guns from their possession."}}
{"Q": "My friend is a hunter. Which event could cause The elk was nowhere to be found?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She set up a hunting blind in the woods. (B) My friend who is a hunter found lots of elk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She set up a hunting blind in the woods.\nExplanation: Setting up a hunting blind in the woods does not guarantee that the hunter will find elk. Elk are wild animals and can move around freely, so it is possible that they simply were not in the area where the hunting blind was set up. On the other hand, if the friend who is a hunter found lots of elk, it is unlikely that the elk would suddenly disappear without any explanation."}}
{"Q": "I walked into my math class. Which event could cause I ended up failing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I saw the string by the door. (B) I didn't study for the test.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I didn't study for the test.\nExplanation: Not studying for the test is a more plausible reason for failing a math class than simply seeing a string by the door. Failing to prepare for a test can result in poor performance and ultimately lead to failing the class. Seeing a string by the door is unlikely to have any significant impact on academic performance."}}
{"Q": "In 1989, our company started using personal computers. Which event could cause When she got her pc later she did not know how to use it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) we bought the owners grandmother a new pc. (B) Our founder Rachel only uses the PC.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Our founder Rachel only uses the PC.\nExplanation: The fact that the company started using personal computers in 1989 does not necessarily mean that every employee received one at the same time. It is possible that Rachel, as the founder, was the only one using a PC initially, and later on, other employees received their own computers. Therefore, it is more plausible that the reason for the employee not knowing how to use her PC was due to Rachel being the only one using it and not providing adequate training or support for the other employees."}}
{"Q": "Mary doesn't like cold weather. Which event could cause At least until she can afford to move to warmer state?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary wears two jackets. (B) It seemed that the cold weather stopped for two months.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It seemed that the cold weather stopped for two months.\n\nExplanation: Mary's dislike for cold weather suggests that she would prefer warmer temperatures. Wearing two jackets may provide some temporary relief, but it is not a long-term solution. On the other hand, if the cold weather stopped for two months, Mary would have a more comfortable living environment during that time. This event would be more plausible as a solution for Mary's dislike of cold weather until she can afford to move to a warmer state."}}
{"Q": "Amy and her friends were out at 3 AM. Which event could cause They stayed there breathing hard, and praying they hadn't been seen?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They started getting followed by a policeman, ran, and hid behind a building. (B) The decided to break into the football field. When suddenly they saw a flashlight comming towards them. They all started running for the bleachers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that they were being followed by a policeman and had to hide behind a building, rather than randomly deciding to break into a football field and getting caught by a flashlight. Additionally, the fact that they were breathing hard and praying they hadn't been seen suggests a sense of urgency and fear, which would be more likely in a situation involving law enforcement."}}
{"Q": "Bob's parents grounded him. Which event could cause He came back home but his parents didn't even know he left?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob got caught sneaking out. (B) Bob got away with sneaking out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Bob got away with sneaking out.\n\nExplanation: If Bob got caught sneaking out, it is unlikely that his parents would not know he left. However, if Bob got away with sneaking out, he could have returned home without his parents knowing he left in the first place. This scenario is more plausible as it suggests that Bob was able to sneak out undetected and return home without raising any suspicion."}}
{"Q": "Amy worked in the stockroom at Marshall's. Which event could cause Amy decided she would push herself to meet her new quota?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy won an award for how much work she accomplished and was given the same quota. (B) Amy's boss said she needed to do more.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Amy's boss said she needed to do more.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Amy's boss telling her to do more would motivate her to push herself to meet her new quota, rather than winning an award and being given the same quota. When given a challenge or a goal to strive for, people often feel motivated to work harder and push themselves to achieve it. Therefore, it is more likely that Amy's boss's request would be the event that caused her to push herself to meet her new quota."}}
{"Q": "Jason had always admired the fast movements of boxers he saw on TV. Which event could cause He won his first fight by knockout?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He didn't let his inspiration go to waste, he trained and trained. (B) Jason learned to knit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He didn't let his inspiration go to waste, he trained and trained.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jason's admiration for boxers on TV inspired him to train and improve his own boxing skills, leading to his first knockout victory. Learning to knit, on the other hand, would not have any direct correlation to his success in boxing."}}
{"Q": "Erin tried to learn how to draw. Which event could cause So she joined a drawing class?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Erin, practiced drawing at home with no luck. (B) Erin, practiced drawing at home and became recognized for her talent.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Erin, practiced drawing at home with no luck.\nExplanation: If Erin was not successful in learning how to draw on her own, she may have decided to join a drawing class to receive guidance and instruction from a teacher or more experienced artists. On the other hand, if Erin became recognized for her talent, she may not have felt the need to join a class and could have continued to develop her skills on her own or through other means. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jon decided to steal a police car. Which event could cause Jon went to prison for three years?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jon crashed the police car into a telephone poll. (B) Jon wasn't caught.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jon crashed the police car into a telephone poll.\n\nExplanation: If Jon crashed the police car into a telephone poll, he would likely be caught by the police and charged with multiple crimes, including theft of a police vehicle and reckless driving. These charges could result in a prison sentence of up to three years, depending on the severity of the damage caused by the crash and Jon's criminal history. On the other hand, if Jon wasn't caught, he would not face any legal consequences for stealing the police car."}}
{"Q": "I used to procrastinate about studying. Which event could cause Now, I never procrastinate studying?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I failed a big test. (B) After getting a good grade, I learned an easy lesson.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Failing a big test can be a wake-up call for many students and can motivate them to change their study habits. The fear of failing again can push them to start studying earlier and more consistently, leading to a decrease in procrastination. On the other hand, getting a good grade without putting in much effort may reinforce the belief that procrastination is okay, leading to continued procrastination in the future. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jacob hated walking to school. Which event could cause Jacob was able to buy himself a used truck after 5 months of saving?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jacob decided to buy himself a car. (B) Jacob couldn't afford a car.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Jacob decided to buy himself a car.\nExplanation: If Jacob decided to buy himself a car, it would motivate him to save money for it. This would give him a goal to work towards and make the daily walk to school more bearable. After 5 months of saving, he was able to buy a used truck, which would make his commute much easier and more enjoyable. Therefore, this event is more plausible than option (B) where Jacob couldn't afford a car, as it doesn't explain how he was able to buy a truck after 5 months of saving."}}
{"Q": "Roy went to the park to watch Little League baseball. Which event could cause The visiting team developed performance issues as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He yelled at the players for every home run. (B) Roy made the other team uncomfortable.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Roy made the other team uncomfortable.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the visiting team developed performance issues due to feeling uncomfortable or intimidated by Roy's behavior, rather than him yelling at them for every home run. Yelling at the players may not have a direct impact on their performance, but making the other team uncomfortable could affect their focus and confidence on the field."}}
{"Q": "Stan started to feel sick at school one day. Which event could cause Stan finally recovered but said he wanted a flu shot from now on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Stan was out of school for a week with the stomach ache. (B) The school nurse sent Stan home from school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The school nurse sent Stan home from school.\n\nExplanation: If Stan was out of school for a week with a stomach ache, it is more likely that he had a stomach virus rather than the flu. However, if the school nurse sent him home from school, it is possible that she suspected he had the flu and recommended he get a flu shot in the future to prevent it from happening again."}}
{"Q": "Lisa and Tim had been married for a long time. Which event could cause It worked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa and Tim went to a fertility clinic to get pregnant. (B) They decided to try the advice given in a book about guitar playing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They decided to try the advice given in a book about guitar playing.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lisa and Tim, who have been married for a long time, would try to improve their skills in a hobby they both enjoy, such as playing the guitar, rather than going to a fertility clinic to get pregnant. Improving their guitar playing skills could bring them closer together and strengthen their bond, while trying to conceive a child may not necessarily guarantee a successful pregnancy."}}
{"Q": "Adam loves to eat sandwiches when he drinks. Which event could cause Adam choked to death because he forgot to take off the cheese wrapper?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Adam made himself a sandwich using bread, turkey, and a slice of American cheese. (B) Adam made himself a pb&j sandwich.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: In choice A, Adam made a sandwich with a slice of American cheese. If he forgot to take off the cheese wrapper, it could potentially cause him to choke to death. In choice B, there is no cheese involved, so forgetting to take off a wrapper would not be a choking hazard. Therefore, choice A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was painting his fence. Which event could cause Tom left his fence half painted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom got tired of painting after he finished. (B) Tom heard a game was on and left.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom heard a game was on and left.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Tom was distracted by something he found more interesting than painting his fence. It is common for people to leave tasks unfinished when they become distracted or lose interest in them. On the other hand, it is less likely that Tom would stop painting his fence simply because he got tired after finishing, as he would have likely planned to finish the job before starting it."}}
{"Q": "Amy decided to move from Wisconsin to Florida. Which event could cause However the experience was no fun without her friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She would be with her friends out there. (B) Amy wanted to live by the beadch.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She would be with her friends out there.\nExplanation: The statement \"the experience was no fun without her friends\" suggests that Amy values the company of her friends and enjoys spending time with them. Therefore, it is more plausible that she would have a better experience if she were with her friends in Florida rather than living by the beach alone. Option A suggests that Amy's friends are in Florida, which would make her move more enjoyable. Option B does not address the issue of Amy missing her friends and is therefore less likely to be the cause of her negative experience."}}
{"Q": "Roger wanted to play tennis as well as Roger Federer. Which event could cause No one ever told Roger all his balls never landed in the court?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Roger overslept and lounged most the day. (B) Roger tried but he wasn't as good as his idol.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Roger tried but he wasn't as good as his idol.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Roger's lack of success in playing tennis like Roger Federer is due to his own limitations and not being as skilled as his idol, rather than him oversleeping and lounging around all day. The statement about his balls not landing in the court suggests that he was actively trying to play, but was not successful."}}
{"Q": "Julie had a coworker named Barry who loved to make trouble for others. Which event could cause Julie was incredibly embarrassed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Barry did not tell anyone that Julie farted. (B) Barry laughed at Julie's unzipped pants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Barry laughed at Julie's unzipped pants.\nExplanation: While passing gas is a natural bodily function, having one's pants unzipped can be seen as a more embarrassing situation. Additionally, Barry's tendency to make trouble for others suggests that he would find amusement in embarrassing Julie in this way. Therefore, it is more plausible that Julie would be incredibly embarrassed by Barry laughing at her unzipped pants."}}
{"Q": "Bob decided to hike in the jungles of Indonesia. Which event could cause Bob had also forgotten his shoes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob stopped in the middle of the hike because he had no bug spray. (B) Bob stopped in the middle of his hike to tie his shoes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bob forgot his shoes because he was focused on bringing bug spray to protect himself from the insects in the jungle. Forgetting to tie his shoes seems less likely to cause him to forget his shoes altogether."}}
{"Q": "Lucy got all her friends together for a pizza party. Which event could cause When the pizzas were done, they had a taste and were delicious?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy decided to make the pizzas at home. (B) Lucy started ordering the pizza.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Lucy decided to make the pizzas at home.\nExplanation: If Lucy made the pizzas at home, it is more likely that she and her friends would taste the pizzas and find them delicious. This is because Lucy would have control over the ingredients and the cooking process, ensuring that the pizzas were made to her and her friends' liking. On the other hand, if Lucy ordered the pizzas, there is a chance that they may not have been to everyone's taste, as they would have been made by someone else."}}
{"Q": "It was a very windy day. Which event could cause Jim wished he hadn't gone out in his new hat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim found his new hat in a storm. (B) Jim's hat blew away in the wind.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jim's hat blew away in the wind.\nExplanation: Since it was a very windy day, it is more plausible that Jim's hat blew away in the wind rather than him finding his new hat in a storm. It is common for hats to be blown away by strong winds, especially if they are not secured properly. Therefore, it is more likely that Jim wished he hadn't gone out in his new hat because it blew away in the wind."}}
{"Q": "Trevor went to the lake one day to fish. Which event could cause Trevor was forced to go home after he lost his fishing pole?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The water was perfect for all levels of fishing. (B) The water was spitting up poles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The water was spitting up poles.\nExplanation: If the water was spitting up poles, it is likely that Trevor's fishing pole was also lost due to this event. This would force him to go home as he would not be able to continue fishing without a pole. On the other hand, if the water was perfect for all levels of fishing, it would not be a reason for Trevor to go home."}}
{"Q": "My sister lived at the top of a highrise apartment. Which event could cause I realized I was afraid of such massive heights and I fainted?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I went to visit her and stepped out onto the balcony of her apartment with a great view. (B) I looked down from her balcony to see the clouds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Stepping out onto the balcony of a highrise apartment with a great view can be overwhelming for some people, especially if they have a fear of heights. The sudden exposure to such a massive height can trigger a panic attack or fainting spell. Looking down from the balcony may also cause fear, but it is less likely to cause fainting as it is a gradual exposure to the height. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Allister was practicing her with her bow. Which event could cause It ended up coming straight down and landing on the instructor's foot?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Allister was still a novice at the bow. (B) Allister was a pro at the bow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Allister was still a novice at the bow.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a novice would have less control over their bow and accidentally release the arrow in an unintended direction, such as straight down. A pro would have more experience and skill in handling their bow, making it less likely for such an accident to occur."}}
{"Q": "Billy was going to have his boss over for dinner. Which event could cause He was still vacuuming when his boss arrived?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Billy played games and forgot about cleaning until 5PM. (B) Billy got home from work early.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Billy got home from work early.\nExplanation: If Billy got home from work early, he may not have had enough time to finish cleaning before his boss arrived. This scenario is more plausible than Billy forgetting about cleaning until 5PM, as it is unlikely that someone would forget about cleaning when they have an important guest coming over for dinner."}}
{"Q": "Maya was walking alongside a river, looking for frogs. Which event could cause Luckily, she was able to get back up and walk home safely?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She ended up falling into the river. (B) Maya slipped on some rocks and broke her back.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She ended up falling into the river.\nExplanation: While it is possible for Maya to slip on some rocks and injure herself, breaking her back seems unlikely. On the other hand, falling into the river is a more plausible event that could happen while walking alongside it. However, the fact that she was able to get back up and walk home safely suggests that she did not suffer any serious injuries from the fall."}}
{"Q": "Susan was making a soup. Which event could cause She did her best to cut away the bad parts?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She had to put in some broth. (B) She had to put in some chicken.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She had to put in some chicken.\nExplanation: If Susan was making a soup with chicken, it is plausible that she would need to cut away any bad parts of the chicken before adding it to the soup. Adding broth alone would not require cutting away any bad parts."}}
{"Q": "Lulu felt so preoccupied lately. Which event could cause But she was prepared to send her because the school was excellent?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lulu's daughter was going to go to school for the first time. (B) Lulu's mom was thinking of sending her to a new house despite her objections.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lulu's daughter was going to go to school for the first time.\nExplanation: It is common for parents to feel preoccupied and anxious when their child is starting school for the first time. Lulu's preparedness to send her daughter to the school suggests that she has been thinking about it and may be feeling nervous about the transition. On the other hand, there is no clear connection between Lulu's mom moving to a new house and Lulu feeling preoccupied about it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to create a video game. Which event could cause Indeed, Java was terrible for programming video games?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I programmed with Java for robot game. (B) I programmed with Java for robot game because it was easy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) I programmed with Java for robot game.\nExplanation: Java is not known for its performance in graphics and real-time processing, which are crucial aspects of video game development. However, if the game being developed is not graphics-intensive and does not require real-time processing, Java can be a suitable language. Therefore, if the event is that the person programmed a robot game with Java, it is plausible that they did not encounter any issues with the language. However, if the event was that they programmed a graphics-intensive video game with Java, it is more likely that they would have faced performance issues."}}
{"Q": "My best friend got married and moved to Hawaii. Which event could cause We celebrated for days and I left for home at the end of the week?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My best friend visited me on a vacation. (B) I went with her to celebrate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I went with her to celebrate.\nExplanation: The fact that the speaker mentions celebrating for days suggests that they were present for the wedding festivities. Additionally, the mention of leaving at the end of the week implies that they were staying for an extended period of time, which would be more likely if they were attending a wedding celebration rather than just a casual visit. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker went with their best friend to Hawaii to celebrate her wedding."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to an electronics store to buy earphones. Which event could cause Tom decided to always buy more expensive ear phones?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was an elitist. (B) Tom bought costly ones but they broke right away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Tom bought costly earphones but they broke right away, he may assume that cheaper earphones are not durable and may not provide good sound quality. This experience may lead him to believe that investing in more expensive earphones is worth it in the long run. On the other hand, there is no evidence to suggest that Tom is an elitist, so option A is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Kaya needed to buy a new dress for the upcoming Spring Formal. Which event could cause She couldn't resist so she bought the antique vase?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At the store, Kaya saw a very beautiful vase. (B) Kaya could not find a single thing at the store,.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kaya could not find a single thing at the store.\nExplanation: If Kaya couldn't find anything she liked at the store, she may have been feeling disappointed or frustrated. In this state of mind, she may have been more susceptible to impulse buying, such as purchasing the antique vase. Additionally, if Kaya was feeling stressed about finding the perfect dress for the Spring Formal, she may have been more likely to make an impulsive purchase as a way to relieve that stress."}}
{"Q": "Sam came home to find water all over his kitchen floor. Which event could cause Sam restocked his new fridge with all his favorite food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam put a towel under the leaky fridge. (B) Sam dishwasher broke and was leaking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sam put a towel under the leaky fridge.\nExplanation: If Sam found water all over his kitchen floor, it is more likely that the cause was a leaky fridge rather than a broken dishwasher. In response to the leak, Sam may have put a towel under the fridge to absorb the water and prevent further damage. Restocking his fridge with his favorite food is not directly related to the cause of the water on the floor, but it is possible that he did so after cleaning up the mess."}}
{"Q": "Anna had a bad headache. Which event could cause Thankfully, when she awoke, the headache was gone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anna took a few asprins and laid down and took a nap. (B) She went to a concert to get rid of it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Anna took a few aspirins and laid down and took a nap.\nExplanation: Aspirin is a common pain reliever that can help alleviate headaches. Rest and sleep can also help reduce headache symptoms. Therefore, it is more plausible that Anna's headache went away after taking aspirin and resting, rather than going to a loud and stimulating concert."}}
{"Q": "Last night I had a dream about biking. Which event could cause I woke up, bitterly disappointed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) my dream was very real and I was on a fun bike tour. (B) I actually have a bike.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the dream was very real and enjoyable, causing disappointment upon waking up and realizing it was just a dream. While having a bike in real life may be a factor in the dream, it is not necessarily a significant enough event to cause such strong emotions upon waking up."}}
{"Q": "It was starting to get late outside. Which event could cause Her parents grounded her for a week for being late?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She forgot what time it was and was home late. (B) She was supposed to be home an hour after she arrived.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) She forgot what time it was and was home late.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person simply lost track of time and was late, rather than intentionally staying out longer than they were supposed to. Forgetting the time is a common mistake, especially if someone is caught up in an activity or conversation. However, being intentionally late by an hour would likely result in a more severe punishment than just being grounded for a week."}}
{"Q": "Kim wanted to buy a car. Which event could cause Kim was hired to a job and saved enough money for her car?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kim needed more money than she could get. (B) Kim applied for jobs to make money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kim applied for jobs to make money.\nExplanation: If Kim applied for jobs and was hired, she would have a source of income to save up for her car. This is a more plausible event than Kim needing more money than she could get, as it implies that Kim was actively working towards her goal of buying a car."}}
{"Q": "Joe was running late for school. Which event could cause Joe had a tasty, healthy breakfast of apples and bananas?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe had plenty of time to cook something. (B) Joe didn't have time to cook something.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Joe didn't have time to cook something.\n\nExplanation: If Joe was running late for school, it is more plausible that he didn't have enough time to cook something and opted for a quick and easy breakfast of apples and bananas. Cooking something would have taken more time and caused him to be even later for school."}}
{"Q": "Tim needed a fruit to eat. Which event could cause Finally, he found some fresh grapes to eat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He went to the near by super market. (B) Tim looked for a long time in the messy fridge.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tim looked for a long time in the messy fridge.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that Tim was already at home and had access to a fridge where he could potentially find some fruit. It also adds the detail that the fridge was messy, which could explain why it took him a while to find the grapes. On the other hand, option (A) suggests that Tim had to go out of his way to find a supermarket, which may not have been necessary if he had some fruit at home."}}
{"Q": "Gina's mom had taken a rap tape from her kids. Which event could cause He stood smiling as his tape was smashed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The rap tape was mean and rude. (B) Gina  take their new tape.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Gina taking their new tape.\nExplanation: If Gina took their new tape, it could be seen as revenge for her mom taking their rap tape. This could cause the person to feel happy or satisfied that they got back at Gina in some way. On the other hand, if the rap tape was mean and rude, the person may not have been happy to see it destroyed and may have felt upset or angry instead. Therefore, option (B) seems like a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kelly loves to eat sweet desserts. Which event could cause We all ate the brownie sundae for dessert?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We ordered a dessert everyone would like. (B) We ordered appetizers everyone would like.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We ordered a dessert everyone would like.\nExplanation: Since Kelly loves sweet desserts, it is likely that the group would choose a dessert that would appeal to her taste. Ordering a dessert that everyone would like would increase the chances of Kelly being satisfied with the choice and enjoying the brownie sundae for dessert. Ordering appetizers would not necessarily have an impact on the dessert choice."}}
{"Q": "Ora had always been overweight. Which event could cause With their help, Ora lost over twenty pounds?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ora decided to eat healthy for a month. (B) Ora decided she wanted to maintainer her weight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ora decided to eat healthy for a month.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ora's decision to eat healthy for a month would lead to her weight loss with the help of others. Maintaining her weight would not necessarily lead to weight loss, and it is not clear how others could help her maintain her weight. However, if Ora made a conscious effort to eat healthier with the support of others, it could lead to sustained weight loss."}}
{"Q": "Priya decided to try a new restaurant. Which event could cause Priya thought her food was delicious?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She ordered two shrimp dishes. (B) The food that Priya ordered was microwaved and precooked.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Priya ordered two shrimp dishes and found them to be delicious, it is more plausible that she would think her food was delicious. Shrimp is a popular and tasty seafood, and if the restaurant prepared it well, it could leave a positive impression on Priya. On the other hand, if the food was microwaved and precooked, it is less likely that Priya would find it delicious as it may lack freshness and flavor."}}
{"Q": "Jamie and Candice were going on a date. Which event could cause Finally, they settled on ice cream?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jamie and Candice did not know what movie to see. (B) Jamie and Candice couldn't decide what to do.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jamie and Candice couldn't decide what to do.\n\nExplanation: If Jamie and Candice couldn't decide what to do, they may have gone through a list of options and ultimately settled on getting ice cream as a simple and enjoyable activity. This is a more plausible explanation than (A) because if they couldn't decide on a movie, they could have easily chosen a different activity altogether, such as going for a walk or playing mini-golf."}}
{"Q": "Scott has felt increasingly unhappy in his last few Year's in New York. Which event could cause Driving out of New York, Scott feels both relieved and nostalgic?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scott found a job in New York. (B) The daily grind, extreme traffic and rude city dwellers left Scott longing for small town living.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The daily grind, extreme traffic and rude city dwellers left Scott longing for small town living.\nExplanation: If Scott found a job in New York, it is unlikely that he would feel relieved and nostalgic upon leaving the city. However, if the daily grind, extreme traffic and rude city dwellers were causing him to feel unhappy, then leaving the city would provide him with relief. Additionally, feeling nostalgic suggests that he has positive memories of his time in New York, which could be explained by the fact that he may have enjoyed certain aspects of the city despite feeling unhappy overall."}}
{"Q": "I went to the store one day to buy clothes. Which event could cause I went home and the jeans fit much better?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I got larger sizes. (B) I bought jeans thought they were a bit expensive.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) I got larger sizes.\nExplanation: If the person got larger sizes, it means the jeans would fit better as they would not be too tight or uncomfortable. Buying jeans that are too small would not make them fit better, and buying expensive jeans does not necessarily mean they will fit better. Therefore, getting larger sizes is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sam was on a date with her boyfriend. Which event could cause When her boyfriend asked if she wanted to hang out, she yelled at him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They ran into a cute friend of Sam's on the way to dinner. (B) The date went bad, they went home on good terms.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Sam ran into a cute friend on the way to dinner, she may have become distracted or excited and forgotten about her plans with her boyfriend. When he asked if she still wanted to hang out, she may have become frustrated or angry that he wasn't as enthusiastic about the friend as she was. This could lead to her yelling at him. On the other hand, if the date went bad but they still went home on good terms, there would be no reason for Sam to yell at her boyfriend."}}
{"Q": "Pam does surveys daily to try to win prizes on Survey Monkey. Which event could cause Pam did not seem to think there was anything wrong with that?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Pam tried her best to be as honest as possible. (B) Pam wasted time with doing her surveys.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Pam tried her best to be as honest as possible.\nExplanation: Pam's daily surveys on Survey Monkey may not necessarily be a waste of time if she is genuinely interested in providing honest feedback and opinions. In fact, her consistent participation may increase her chances of winning prizes. As long as Pam is not neglecting her other responsibilities or spending an excessive amount of time on the surveys, there is nothing inherently wrong with her daily survey-taking habit."}}
{"Q": "Lydia had a strange dream last night. Which event could cause Lydia wished the dream were real?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) In Lydia's dream, she was poor and lonely. (B) In Lydia's dream, she was rich and famous.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: In Lydia's dream, she was rich and famous.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lydia would wish her dream were real if she was rich and famous, as this is often seen as a desirable state. Being poor and lonely, as in choice (A), is generally not something people would wish for in real life. Therefore, it is more likely that Lydia would want her dream of being rich and famous to come true."}}
{"Q": "Dana always wanted to ride a bike. Which event could cause They were riding around together within minutes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dana asked a neighbor to ride with her. (B) Her friend asked Dana to teach her how to ride.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Dana asked a neighbor to ride with her.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Dana's desire to ride a bike led her to seek out someone to ride with, rather than her friend suddenly asking her to teach her how to ride. Additionally, if Dana's friend was learning how to ride, it would likely take more than a few minutes for them to both be riding around together."}}
{"Q": "Kelly wanted to try out for soccer this year. Which event could cause Kelly celebrated by getting pizza?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly tried out for the soccer team but was cut. (B) Kelly made it onto the team.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Kelly made it onto the team.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Kelly would celebrate with pizza if she made it onto the team rather than being cut from the team. Making the team is a positive outcome and a reason to celebrate, while being cut would likely be disappointing and not a cause for celebration."}}
{"Q": "Tom was excited to use his new gas grill. Which event could cause Tom's garage and grill were both destroyed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom didn't check the grills gas. (B) Tom didn't check the grill's safety.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: If Tom didn't check the grill's gas, there could be a gas leak that could cause an explosion, which could destroy both the garage and the grill. On the other hand, if Tom didn't check the grill's safety, it could cause a fire, but it is less likely to destroy the garage. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Martin went to camp with his friends. Which event could cause Martin caught many fish so that everyone could eat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Martins friends went fishing without martin. (B) He was the best fisherman of the group.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He was the best fisherman of the group.\n\nExplanation: If Martin was the best fisherman of the group, it is more likely that he caught many fish for everyone to eat. On the other hand, if his friends went fishing without him, it would not necessarily mean that Martin caught many fish. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sam was excited to get his car washed. Which event could cause He had forgotten to close the window in all the excitement?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After the car wash Sam noticed his car seats were all soaking wet. (B) He rolled up all his windows and began daydreaming of how well his car would look after the wash.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Sam had forgotten to close the window, it is more likely that water would have entered the car during the wash and soaked the seats, as described in option A. Option B suggests that Sam had already rolled up all his windows, making it less likely that he would forget to close one."}}
{"Q": "May really wanted to go to the concert that was playing next week. Which event could cause A kind reader wrote back to offer her two free tickets to the concert?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) May sent out tweets looking for tickets. (B) So she bought 2 tickets online.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: May's desire to go to the concert and her attempt to find tickets through social media make it more likely that a kind reader would respond with an offer of free tickets. It is less likely that May would have already purchased tickets online if she was actively seeking free tickets through other means."}}
{"Q": "Mindy decided to go over jake's house. Which event could cause She panicked and ran screaming out of his house?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When Mindy walked in the door, Jake was naked. (B) Mindy scared Jake when she came into the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. When Mindy walked in the door, Jake was naked.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause Mindy to panic and run screaming out of Jake's house because it is a violation of her personal boundaries and could make her feel uncomfortable or unsafe. On the other hand, option B is less likely to cause such a strong reaction as it only involves Mindy scaring Jake, which may be resolved through communication."}}
{"Q": "I was having trouble finding my comfortable slippers. Which event could cause Finders keepers, she told me?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The dog stole the slippers. (B) My sister stole my slippers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Finders keepers is a common phrase used when someone finds something that was lost or abandoned and decides to keep it. In this scenario, if the dog stole the slippers and hid them somewhere, someone else may come across them and decide to keep them, hence the phrase \"finders keepers.\" On the other hand, if the sister stole the slippers, it would not be considered finders keepers as she intentionally took them without permission."}}
{"Q": "I did not like the color of my lips. Which event could cause Over time, people at school accepted me for the person I wished to be?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I used a marker to paint them bright pink. (B) I wanted to have normal lips. I painted them red and people liked it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that painting the lips red and having people like it would lead to acceptance over time, rather than using a marker to paint them bright pink, which may not be socially acceptable and could potentially lead to further rejection. Additionally, wanting to have \"normal\" lips suggests a desire to fit in and be accepted, which aligns with the idea of eventually being accepted by peers."}}
{"Q": "A family went shopping together. Which event could cause The father bought the boy a new computer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their son was very well behaved. (B) The boy needed a new cell phone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The boy needed a new computer.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the father bought the boy a new computer because he needed it, rather than because he was well-behaved. Additionally, the fact that the family went shopping together suggests that they were likely purchasing items that were needed or wanted, rather than simply rewarding good behavior. The option about the boy needing a new cell phone is not relevant to the purchase of a computer."}}
{"Q": "I was working on my laptop one day. Which event could cause After paying the bill, I no longer experienced issues?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) i got an e-mail saying my cable bill was current and service would be upgraded. (B) The internet was very slow and then stopped completely.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the issue was related to internet connectivity, receiving an e-mail about cable bill payment and service upgrade could mean that the service was restored or upgraded, which could have resolved the issue. On the other hand, if the internet stopped completely, paying the bill would not have any effect on the issue."}}
{"Q": "Isa was getting married but couldn't afford a bouquet. Which event could cause Isa ended up with a beautiful hand picked bouquet?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Isa went to the country site and found some flowers. (B) Isa forgot about the bouquet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Isa went to the country site and found some flowers.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Isa would go out of her way to find flowers for her wedding rather than forgetting about the bouquet altogether. Additionally, going to the countryside to pick flowers is a common and cost-effective way to create a beautiful bouquet."}}
{"Q": "There is a beaver that has been building a dam by our school. Which event could cause The beaver decided to leave the area and went further down stream?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People destroyed the dam the beaver was building. (B) Everyone was all over the hotel, trying to see him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) People destroyed the dam the beaver was building.\nExplanation: Beavers are known to be very territorial and protective of their dams. If people were to destroy the dam the beaver was building, it would be a threat to the beaver's home and food source. This could cause the beaver to feel unsafe and decide to leave the area in search of a new location to build a dam. On the other hand, choice (B) does not seem like a plausible reason for the beaver to leave as they are not typically bothered by people unless they feel threatened."}}
{"Q": "My family was on vacation in Italy. Which event could cause It was our favorite picture of the vacation?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We took a beautiful picture of Spain. (B) We took a photo next to the coliseum in Rome.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. We took a photo next to the coliseum in Rome.\nExplanation: Since the family was on vacation in Italy, it is more likely that a photo taken in Italy would be their favorite picture of the vacation. The coliseum is a famous landmark in Rome and a popular tourist destination, so it is plausible that the family would have enjoyed taking a photo there and cherishing it as their favorite picture of the vacation. Option A, which mentions a beautiful picture of Spain, is not relevant to the context of the family's vacation in Italy."}}
{"Q": "I told Bill not to go to Lansing. Which event could cause He got in an accident on the highway, he should of listened?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bill said he would be fine and left. (B) Bill went to Lansing via air anyways.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Bill said he would be fine and left despite being warned not to go, it is more plausible that he got in an accident on the highway and should have listened to the warning. In option (B), Bill went to Lansing via air, which would not have put him at risk of getting in an accident on the highway."}}
{"Q": "Liv wanted to dance ballet. Which event could cause Liv's classmates her so jealous and shocked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Liv's mother signed her up. (B) She was not very talented.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Liv's classmates were jealous and shocked, it is more likely that Liv showed a natural talent for ballet that they did not expect. If Liv's mother signed her up, it would not necessarily cause jealousy or shock among her classmates. However, if Liv was not very talented, it would be surprising for her classmates to see her excel in ballet and could cause jealousy and shock."}}
{"Q": "A little boy sick in a hospital worshiped a famous basketball player. Which event could cause Standing in front of the coffee shop was the ball player?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) One day a nurse said they should go to the coffee shop for a treat. (B) The baseball player looked out the window at a coffee shop.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The baseball player looked out the window at a coffee shop.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the little boy saw the basketball player standing in front of the coffee shop because he happened to be there, rather than a nurse suggesting they go to the coffee shop and coincidentally running into the basketball player. Additionally, it is more likely that a famous basketball player would be out and about in public, rather than inside a hospital where he may not be allowed to visit due to privacy and safety concerns."}}
{"Q": "Jake was off roading. Which event could cause He had to get help to get out?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jake ended up getting free from the mud. (B) Jake got stuff in the mud.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jake got stuck in the mud.\nExplanation: If Jake got stuff in the mud, it is more likely that he got stuck and needed help to get out. If he had just ended up getting free from the mud, he wouldn't have needed help."}}
{"Q": "I got a new racing game yesterday. Which event could cause Finally after hours of playing I stopped?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was so fun, I was a clown. (B) I sat down to test out the game.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for stopping playing the game was because the person sat down to test out the game and eventually got tired or had other things to do. Option A, where the person became a clown due to the fun of the game, is not a realistic explanation for stopping playing a game."}}
{"Q": "Freda is the boss of her office. Which event could cause Freda can't understand why people have a problem with her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She doesn't ask nicely to get things indefinite. (B) She doesn't ask nicely to get things done.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She doesn't ask nicely to get things done.\nExplanation: If Freda doesn't ask nicely to get things done, it could cause people to have a problem with her because they may feel disrespected or undervalued. As the boss, it's important for Freda to communicate effectively and respectfully with her employees to maintain a positive work environment. If she doesn't understand why people have a problem with her, it could be because she's not aware of how her communication style is affecting others."}}
{"Q": "Carly had just called her kids in from playing outside. Which event could cause Then, she put some medicated lotion on her and hoped it would pass?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One of them had a bad cough. (B) Carly, noticed her daughter had gotten into Poison Ivy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Carly, noticed her daughter had gotten into Poison Ivy.\nExplanation: The fact that Carly put medicated lotion on herself suggests that she may have also noticed a rash or irritation on her daughter's skin. Poison Ivy is a common cause of skin irritation and rash, especially in children who play outside. It is more plausible that Carly would put medicated lotion on herself and hope it would pass if her daughter had gotten into Poison Ivy rather than if one of them had a bad cough."}}
{"Q": "Alexis had cut down a Christmas tree in the woods. Which event could cause When she put it up, it was the right size for her ceiling?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alexis made sure the tree wasn't under 20 feet tall. (B) Alexis was worried it would be too big.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Alexis made sure the tree wasn't under 20 feet tall.\nExplanation: If Alexis had made sure the tree wasn't under 20 feet tall, it would have been a deliberate action on her part to ensure that the tree would fit her ceiling. This would make it more plausible that the tree was the right size for her ceiling when she put it up. On the other hand, if Alexis was worried it would be too big, it suggests that she did not take any specific steps to ensure that the tree would fit her ceiling, making it less likely that it would end up being the right size."}}
{"Q": "Francine had always dreamed of being a fashion designer. Which event could cause She was so proud that she followed her dreams?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Francine decided to go to school to pursue her dreams. (B) francine applied to business school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Francine decided to go to school to pursue her dreams.\nExplanation: Pursuing her dreams by going to school shows that Francine is taking concrete steps towards achieving her goal of becoming a fashion designer. This decision demonstrates her commitment and determination to follow her passion, which would make her proud of herself. Applying to business school, on the other hand, may not necessarily be related to her dream of becoming a fashion designer and may not evoke the same sense of pride."}}
{"Q": "Jack went to his first basketball game with his dad. Which event could cause As the crowd cheered, Jack knew they'd never forget his first game?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack caught a ball that bounced over the fence. (B) Jack saw how wild the crowd was getting.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: It is more likely that the excitement and energy of the crowd would leave a lasting impression on Jack, rather than him catching a ball that bounced over the fence. The atmosphere and enthusiasm of the fans can greatly enhance the experience of attending a live sporting event."}}
{"Q": "Nathan bullied a lot of other boys at school. Which event could cause Nathan knew his violence would never prevent his own abuse?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nathan never got into a fight. (B) Nathan got detention in school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Nathan never got into a fight.\nExplanation: If Nathan never got into a fight, it is possible that he realized that his violence would not prevent his own abuse. He may have observed that even though he bullied others, he was still vulnerable to being bullied himself. This realization could have led him to understand that violence is not an effective way to protect oneself and others. On the other hand, getting detention in school may not necessarily lead to this realization, as it could be seen as a consequence of his behavior rather than a reflection of the ineffectiveness of violence."}}
{"Q": "Mike made homemade pasta one day. Which event could cause Pasta is now a regular staple of Mike's diet?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike found pasta hard to make. (B) Mile loves italian food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Mike loves Italian food.\nExplanation: If Mike loves Italian food, it is more likely that he will continue to make and eat pasta regularly. Enjoying the taste and variety of Italian cuisine can lead to incorporating pasta into his regular diet. On the other hand, finding pasta hard to make may discourage him from making it again, making it less likely to become a regular staple in his diet."}}
{"Q": "Randy's friend gave him directions to his house. Which event could cause Randy told his friend how relieved he was he found it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Randy knew the area well. (B) He didn't know that part of town very good.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He didn't know that part of town very well.\nExplanation: If Randy didn't know that part of town very well, it would make sense for him to feel relieved when he found his friend's house. On the other hand, if Randy knew the area well, he would have been less likely to feel relieved and more likely to have found his friend's house easily."}}
{"Q": "Cay had a crush on a boy in her class. Which event could cause He smiled at her after and said he liked her too?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cat sent a love note to the boy. (B) She told him she did not like him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cay sending a love note to the boy.\n\nExplanation: If Cay sent a love note to the boy, it would indicate to him that she has feelings for him. If he also has feelings for her, he may smile at her and express his own feelings in response. On the other hand, if Cay told him she did not like him, it is unlikely that he would smile and say he liked her too."}}
{"Q": "Lacy and Karen got in a fight. Which event could cause Karen apologized too so they could be friends again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Karen missed Lacy so much, she couldn't bear not talking to her friend. (B) Lacy missed Karen so much, she couldn't bear not talking to her friend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Karen missed Lacy so much, she couldn't bear not talking to her friend.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it shows that Karen is taking responsibility for her actions and is willing to apologize to Lacy in order to repair their friendship. Option B suggests that Lacy is the one who needs to apologize, which may not be the case. Additionally, it is more common for friends to miss each other and want to reconcile after a fight, rather than one friend missing the other and the other not caring."}}
{"Q": "My friend had an announcement to make. Which event could cause So, I put on a smile and wished him the best of luck?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My friend told us he had cancer and was expected to die in a week. (B) my friend usually talks about some business deal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) my friend usually talks about some business deal.\nExplanation: If your friend usually talks about business deals, it is more likely that his announcement is related to that rather than a sudden and tragic diagnosis of cancer. In this case, putting on a smile and wishing him the best of luck would be an appropriate response to show support for his business endeavors."}}
{"Q": "George was about to participate in his first professional fight. Which event could cause George proved his skills and won his first match?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) George trained hard for two days before the fight. (B) George was the underdog, but he had been training months to compete in this event.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that George's months of training would have prepared him better for the fight than just two days of hard training. Being the underdog also adds to the excitement and drama of the match, making it more likely that George's victory would be seen as a testament to his skills and determination."}}
{"Q": "Bob and his kids love football. Which event could cause Bob and his kids share a hug to celebrate the win?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The team that Bob and his kids like won. (B) They played basketball out back all afternoon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The team that Bob and his kids like won.\nExplanation: Since Bob and his kids love football, it is more plausible that they would share a hug to celebrate the win of their favorite team rather than playing basketball out back all afternoon. Winning a game that they are passionate about would bring them joy and a sense of accomplishment, which could lead to a celebratory hug."}}
{"Q": "Alex was at target with his mom. Which event could cause He begged his mother to buy it until she gave in?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He didn't see the toy he really wanted in any of the aisles. (B) Alex saw a game he really wanted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Alex saw a game he really wanted.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alex begged his mother to buy something he really wanted, rather than not finding the toy he wanted in any of the aisles. Additionally, the fact that he begged until his mother gave in suggests that it was something he really wanted, like a game."}}
{"Q": "Nova dreamed of being a professional dancer. Which event could cause Nova's second choice accepted her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nova applied to a few dance schools but was denied by her first choice. (B) Nova applied to one dance school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Nova applied to a few dance schools but was denied by her first choice, it is possible that she could still be accepted by her second choice. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as her skills and experience being a better fit for the second choice school, or the second choice school having different criteria for acceptance. Additionally, if Nova only applied to one dance school (option B), there would be no second choice for her to be accepted by."}}
{"Q": "Carla and Sam spent the morning building a sand castle. Which event could cause The tide had rolled in, smashing it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) An unexpected event happened when the tide didn't come in that day. (B) The sand castle was built right on the shore.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The sand castle was built right on the shore.\nExplanation: If Carla and Sam built the sand castle right on the shore, it would be more likely that the tide could come in and smash it. The tide is a natural occurrence that happens every day, so it is not unexpected for it to come in and affect the sand castle. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tami was in the 8th grade. Which event could cause Tami made up her mind to try out for the JV Volleyball team?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She wanted to be less involved and lose friends. (B) Tami was tall for her age.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Tami being tall for her age is a more plausible reason for her to try out for the JV Volleyball team. Being tall is an advantage in volleyball, and it is likely that Tami recognized this and wanted to use her height to her advantage in the sport. On the other hand, wanting to be less involved and lose friends is not a logical reason for someone to try out for a sports team."}}
{"Q": "Donald is running for president. Which event could cause Hopefully he loses the election?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Donald is a selfless, wonderful person. (B) Donald is not the candidate I want for president.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: While option A may seem like a desirable outcome for some, it is not a realistic event that would cause Donald to lose the election. Option B, on the other hand, is a more plausible event as it reflects personal preference and the fact that not everyone will support Donald's candidacy. Ultimately, the election outcome will depend on the majority of voters' opinions and choices."}}
{"Q": "I was very out of shape. Which event could cause After weeks of jumping rope, I began to feel excellent?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had rope that I used for jumping at home. (B) I committed to exercise every month by jumping rope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I committed to exercise every month by jumping rope.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that committing to a regular exercise routine of jumping rope would lead to feeling better after weeks of consistent effort. Having a rope at home may be helpful, but it alone would not necessarily lead to significant improvements in fitness. Consistency and dedication to exercise are key factors in improving physical health."}}
{"Q": "Ora's mom told her that the family had a very high gas bill. Which event could cause Ora was unhappy, but she understood?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ora's family needed to use more gas. (B) Ora's mom kicked her out of the house so their gas bill would reduce.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Ora's family needing to use more gas would be a more plausible reason for a high gas bill. It is possible that the family had to use more gas due to colder weather or other circumstances, which would be an understandable reason for the increase in the bill. On the other hand, Ora's mom kicking her out of the house to reduce the gas bill is an extreme and unlikely scenario that would not be a reasonable explanation for a high gas bill."}}
{"Q": "Some dog kept me awake till I could not take it anymore. Which event could cause I gave the puppy the food and I went back to bed, both of us happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The puppy was given to me by a stork. (B) I got up and tried to find out why they kept barking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I got up and tried to find out why they kept barking.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for the puppy's barking was due to some discomfort or need, such as hunger or needing to go outside. By getting up and addressing the issue, such as giving the puppy food or taking them outside, both the puppy and the person could be satisfied and able to go back to sleep. The idea of a stork delivering a puppy is not a realistic explanation."}}
{"Q": "Dan entered an eating contest at his local fair. Which event could cause Dan lost the contest, and was sick for days?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan ate a lot of food very slowly, hoping to win. (B) Dan tried to eat 30 cold hot dogs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Eating 30 cold hot dogs in a short amount of time could cause Dan to choke or suffer from indigestion, leading to him losing the contest and feeling sick for days afterwards. Eating slowly may not have caused him to lose the contest, but it also wouldn't have helped him win."}}
{"Q": "Melissa's friend was coming for a visit. Which event could cause Luckily, when Melissa pointed this out, her friend apologized?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Melissa was being rude. (B) Melissa's friend insisted they go out to eat somewhere Melissa hated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Melissa's friend insisted they go out to eat somewhere Melissa hated.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Melissa's friend's insistence on going to a restaurant that Melissa hated could cause Melissa to point out her dislike. In response, her friend may have realized her mistake and apologized. It is less likely that Melissa was being rude, as this would not necessarily prompt an apology from her friend."}}
{"Q": "Nell's teacher admired her artistic student. Which event could cause The teacher was impressed that Nell drew an X-ray of an animal?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nell studied biology to draw an animal. (B) Nell was told to do something unexpected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Nell studied biology to draw an animal.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Nell's teacher was impressed with her drawing of an X-ray of an animal because Nell had studied biology and had a better understanding of the animal's anatomy. This shows that Nell put in effort and research into her artwork, which would impress her teacher. On the other hand, option (B) is less likely as it does not provide a clear reason for why Nell's teacher would be impressed with her drawing of an X-ray of an animal."}}
{"Q": "Eli didn't know how to tie his shoes. Which event could cause Eli learned and now ties like a pro?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His dad asked Eli how to tie his shoes. (B) eli asked his dad how to tie his shoes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Eli asked his dad how to tie his shoes.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Eli learned how to tie his shoes by asking his dad for help. It is common for children to ask their parents for assistance with tasks they are struggling with, and learning how to tie shoes is a common skill that parents teach their children. On the other hand, it is less likely that Eli's dad would ask him how to tie his shoes, as it is typically the parent who teaches the child."}}
{"Q": "When Francine was a little girl, her favorite treat was cotton candy. Which event could cause She purchased a bag to share with her friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was anxious to buy some today. (B) Francine saw bananas for sale at the fair.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Francine saw bananas for sale at the fair.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because seeing bananas for sale at the fair does not directly relate to cotton candy, but it could trigger a memory or craving for a childhood favorite treat. It is more likely that Francine would purchase cotton candy to share with her friends if she was reminded of it in some way, rather than just feeling anxious to buy it."}}
{"Q": "Ben went to the beach on a sunny day. Which event could cause Ben crawled into his tent and napped?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben spent hours sitting in the sun. (B) Ben pitched a large tent on the sand to block out the sun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ben spent hours sitting in the sun.\nExplanation: Sitting in the sun for extended periods can cause fatigue and exhaustion, leading to the need for a nap. Pitching a tent to block out the sun would suggest that Ben was trying to avoid the sun, making it less likely that he would crawl into the tent to nap."}}
{"Q": "Tili wanted to escape from prison. Which event could cause Tili's escape attempt was stopped and punished?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tili ran for the prison gate one night. (B) Doug formulated a plan.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Tili running for the prison gate one night is a more plausible event that could cause her escape attempt to be stopped and punished. It is a direct action that could be caught by the prison guards, whereas Doug formulating a plan may not necessarily lead to an actual escape attempt and may not be discovered by the guards. Running for the prison gate is also a more risky and impulsive action that could result in immediate consequences."}}
{"Q": "Sam had to pay off his credit card debt. Which event could cause Sam eventually made enough to pay off his credit card debt?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam lost his job and could not make the payment. (B) Sam decided to work two jobs to pay off his debt.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Sam decided to work two jobs to pay off his debt.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it shows that Sam is taking proactive steps to pay off his debt. By working two jobs, he is increasing his income and therefore has a better chance of eventually paying off his credit card debt. On the other hand, losing his job would make it even harder for him to pay off his debt."}}
{"Q": "Katie had let her kitchen get pretty messy. Which event could cause She used bleach to be sure that it was clean and safe?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The kitchen got so bad mold might grow. (B) Katie needed to hurry and get it clean.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: If Katie's kitchen had gotten so bad that mold might grow, it would be important for her to use bleach to ensure that it was clean and safe. Mold can be harmful to health, so it's important to take steps to prevent it from growing in the home. On the other hand, if Katie simply needed to hurry and get the kitchen clean, she might not necessarily need to use bleach specifically, and could use other cleaning products instead. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Randy's friend gave him directions to his house. Which event could cause Randy saw the house but kept on driving and didn't come back?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The directions took Randy thru a great part of town. (B) The house had boarded windows and looked bad.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Randy saw the boarded windows and assumed the house was in a bad neighborhood or unsafe, causing him to keep driving and not come back. The directions taking him through a great part of town would not necessarily deter him from reaching his friend's house."}}
{"Q": "I was driving on the highway when my car suddenly broke down. Which event could cause Turns out my insurance covered the tow truck and the rest was cheap?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was worried about how to tow. (B) I called my insurance company to see if I could get assistance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I called my insurance company to see if I could get assistance.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the event that caused the insurance coverage was the driver calling their insurance company for assistance, rather than simply worrying about how to tow the car. Many insurance policies offer roadside assistance, including towing services, so it is likely that the driver was able to utilize this benefit by contacting their insurance provider."}}
{"Q": "Tia was in college and went home for the holidays. Which event could cause Before she left her father told her that they were getting a divorce?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tia had dinner with her parents. (B) Tia thought something seemed good between her parents.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tia had dinner with her parents.\nExplanation: If Tia had dinner with her parents, it is possible that her father could have told her about the divorce before she left for college. However, if Tia thought something seemed good between her parents, it is less likely that her father would have told her about the divorce."}}
{"Q": "Joe's mother bugged him constantly to tie his shoelaces. Which event could cause As he lay at the bottom of the stairs he wished he'd listened?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe tripped down the stairs with his shoes untied. (B) Joe tied them and fell down the stairs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Joe tripped down the stairs with his shoes untied.\n\nExplanation: If Joe's shoes were untied and he tripped down the stairs, it is likely that he would have fallen and potentially injured himself. This event would make him regret not listening to his mother's advice to tie his shoelaces. On the other hand, if Joe tied his shoelaces and fell down the stairs, it would not necessarily be related to his mother's advice and would not make as much sense in the context of the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "Nita was playing rummy with her dad. Which event could cause Nita was so happy she finally beat her dad at rummy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nita practiced playing rummy with a dog. (B) Nita was never able to beat her Dad.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Nita practiced playing rummy with a dog.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Nita improved her skills by practicing with a dog rather than suddenly beating her dad after never being able to before. Practicing with a dog may have helped her develop better strategies and improve her decision-making skills, leading to her victory over her dad."}}
{"Q": "Fred had a job at the fair to fill the balloons. Which event could cause The balloon popped in his face?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Fred saw a child come over with a pin. (B) Fred fill one balloon too small.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Fred fill one balloon too small.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a balloon popping in Fred's face was due to him filling one balloon too small, causing it to burst under pressure. While it is possible that a child with a pin could have caused the balloon to pop, it is less likely as Fred would have been aware of the potential danger and taken precautions."}}
{"Q": "Samantha's dad always taught her how to be self-sufficient. Which event could cause Samantha was very grateful to be able to get home safely?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Samantha found some friends who gave her a ride. (B) She had a flat tire and changed it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Samantha's dad taught her how to be self-sufficient, which means she is capable of taking care of herself in difficult situations. Having a flat tire and being able to change it on her own would be a situation where Samantha would be grateful for her dad's teachings and her own abilities. Finding friends who gave her a ride would not necessarily be related to her self-sufficiency skills."}}
{"Q": "I used my ruined treehouse to build a fort. Which event could cause The new fort is twice as good as the old treehouse?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The tree fell on my fort. (B) It was the right size.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the new fort is twice as good as the old treehouse because it was the right size, rather than the tree falling on the fort. If the tree fell on the fort, it would likely cause damage and make the fort worse, not better. However, if the fort was built to the right size and specifications, it could be more structurally sound and functional than the old treehouse."}}
{"Q": "Mike had to go to the doctor. Which event could cause All the blood work came back clear and he was relieved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike was having blood drawn because he needed a routine checkup. (B) Mike complained of soreness in his kidneys.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If Mike was having blood drawn for a routine checkup, it is likely that the doctor would have ordered a full blood workup. If all the results came back clear, it would be a relief for Mike as it would indicate that he is in good health. On the other hand, if Mike complained of soreness in his kidneys, it is unlikely that a blood test alone would provide relief as there could be other underlying issues that need to be investigated."}}
{"Q": "Everyone thought it was funny that Rocky played hockey. Which event could cause Well, Rocket prefers the term Aerospace Engineer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rocky was very good at playing hockey. (B) Rocky was a rocket scientist, and he hated rockets.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Rocky was a rocket scientist, and he hated rockets.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it explains why Rocky prefers the term Aerospace Engineer instead of being associated with rockets. It also adds a layer of irony to the situation, as someone who works with rockets would be expected to love them, but Rocky does not. This could be a source of humor for those who know him. On the other hand, option (A) does not explain why Rocky prefers the term Aerospace Engineer and does not add any irony to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Arnold was scared of girls. Which event could cause He nearly fainted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Arnold saw a boy. (B) A girl came up to hug him one day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Arnold's fear of girls suggests that he may have a phobia or anxiety around them. Therefore, it is more plausible that a girl coming up to hug him would cause him to nearly faint, as it would be a direct confrontation with his fear. Seeing a boy would not necessarily trigger the same response."}}
{"Q": "Six year old Bobby wanted a cat very badly. Which event could cause Bobby was overjoyed when his mother said the cat could stay?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bobby found a cat in the garden. (B) Bobby begged his mom for a feral cat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Bobby finding a cat in the garden is a more plausible event that could cause him to be overjoyed when his mother said the cat could stay. It is common for children to develop an attachment to animals they find and want to keep them as pets. On the other hand, begging for a feral cat may not be as likely to result in a positive outcome, as feral cats can be difficult to tame and may not make good pets."}}
{"Q": "There was a unique pair of louboutin sandals Lucy had to have. Which event could cause Finally by chance, she stumbled across a pair?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucky looked for them in one store. (B) Lucy looked for the sandals everywhere, but could never find them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lucy looked for the sandals everywhere, but could never find them.\nExplanation: If the sandals were unique and in high demand, it is more plausible that Lucy would have to search multiple stores and locations to find them. It is unlikely that she would find them by chance in just one store."}}
{"Q": "My dad and I like to hunt for worms. Which event could cause My dad and I decided to sell some worms and use the rest for fishing?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We love to go fishing. (B) We found one of them in the backyard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We love to go fishing.\nExplanation: If the father and child enjoy fishing, it would make sense for them to sell some of the worms they found and keep the rest for their own fishing trips. Finding a worm in the backyard (option B) is not a significant enough event to prompt them to start selling worms."}}
{"Q": "We decided to move to a new town next year. Which event could cause It will be a fun adventure?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We grew fond of this town. (B) We got sick of this town.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We grew fond of this town.\nExplanation: If we have grown fond of this town, it means we have had positive experiences and memories here. Moving to a new town would then be seen as an exciting adventure to explore new places, meet new people, and create new memories. It would be a fun adventure because we are open to new experiences and are excited about the possibilities that await us in the new town. On the other hand, if we got sick of this town, it would imply that we have had negative experiences and memories here, and moving to a new town would be seen as a necessary change rather than a fun adventure."}}
{"Q": "Heather stole Ryan's phone. Which event could cause Ryan snatched his phone back and reported Heather to administration?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ryan was mad at Kim for stealing his phone. (B) Heather kept the phone away from Ryan.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Heather kept the phone away from Ryan.\nExplanation: If Heather kept the phone away from Ryan, it would be a reasonable cause for him to snatch it back and report her to administration. It is understandable that Ryan would want his phone back and take action if someone was withholding it from him without his consent. On the other hand, being mad at Kim for stealing his phone is not relevant to the situation and would not be a plausible reason for Ryan's actions towards Heather."}}
{"Q": "Tracy E Warren keeps his house cleaner than any woman. Which event could cause Finally I just asked him and he said he has a maid so now I know?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tracy spends his days scrubbing and cleaning. (B) I asked him how it is so clean.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I asked him how it is so clean.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly addresses the question of how Tracy keeps his house so clean. It also provides a logical explanation for the cleanliness - that he has a maid. Option (A) is less likely because it suggests that Tracy spends all his time cleaning, which is unlikely given that he likely has other responsibilities and interests."}}
{"Q": "Kya was trying to be vegan. Which event could cause Before long, being vegan was effortless?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kya learned many new steak recipes. (B) At first it was hard, but she persevered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) At first it was hard, but she persevered.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kya's initial struggle with being vegan and her perseverance in sticking to it would eventually lead to it becoming effortless for her. Learning new steak recipes, as mentioned in option A, would not necessarily make being vegan effortless for Kya."}}
{"Q": "Today I bought a solar panel system for my house. Which event could cause I hope the system pays for itself within ten years?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The system was very expensive to have installed. (B) This month, my electric bill was double  what is used to be.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This month, my electric bill was double what it used to be.\nExplanation: If the electric bill has increased significantly, it means that the household is consuming more electricity than before. With the solar panel system, the household can generate its own electricity and reduce its reliance on the grid. This can lead to significant savings on the electric bill over time, which can help the system pay for itself within ten years. On the other hand, if the system was very expensive to install, it may take longer for the savings to offset the initial cost, making option (A) less plausible."}}
{"Q": "My parents live a few blocks from me. Which event could cause Somehow there was enough room and it was a lot of fun?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We all had dinner at my big house. (B) We all had dinner at my tiny house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) We all had dinner at my big house.\nExplanation: If the event was having dinner with family members, it is more likely that there was enough room and it was fun at a big house rather than a tiny house. A big house would have more space for everyone to move around comfortably and enjoy the meal together."}}
{"Q": "Lilly sent a lovely table for her dinner party. Which event could cause She didn't tell anyone the cat had been licking it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There wasn't any food on a plate. (B) there was a piece of steak on a plate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) there was a piece of steak on a plate.\n\nExplanation: If there was a piece of steak on a plate, it is more likely that someone would notice the cat hair or saliva on the table, especially if they were cutting the steak and using the table as a surface. On the other hand, if there wasn't any food on a plate, it is less likely that anyone would notice the cat hair or saliva on the table. Therefore, (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Helen hung up the stocking on the railing. Which event could cause And someone had put presents in her stocking?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Helen went to the store. (B) Helen went to sleep.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Helen went to sleep.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that someone put presents in Helen's stocking while she was asleep, as it is a common tradition for Santa Claus or parents to fill stockings with gifts during the night before Christmas. It is less likely that someone would have put presents in her stocking while she was out at the store, as they would not have known when she would return."}}
{"Q": "Tim wanted to mail a gift to his mom in a different state. Which event could cause Tim left an apology in her voicemail and promised to call her later?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim forgot the gift in his car until after her birthday. (B) Tim realized it would barely make it in time for her birthday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Tim forgot the gift in his car until after her birthday, it would be a more plausible reason for him to apologize and promise to call her later. Forgetting the gift would be a bigger mistake than just barely making it in time, and it would be understandable for Tim to feel bad about it and want to make it up to his mom."}}
{"Q": "Greg was arrested for manslaughter. Which event could cause So Greg was convicted?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) greg had not called the police right away. (B) Greg's lawyer made a compelling defense case.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Greg's failure to call the police right away could be seen as evidence of negligence or intent to cover up the crime, which could lead to a conviction for manslaughter. On the other hand, a compelling defense case by Greg's lawyer could potentially result in a not guilty verdict or a lesser charge. However, the outcome of a trial depends on many factors, and it is impossible to predict with certainty what would cause Greg to be convicted."}}
{"Q": "Joe could not remember his address. Which event could cause After that he always remembered it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe could not have a pizza delivered. (B) He made up a a rhyme that included his phone number.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Joe could not have a pizza delivered.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is a practical and urgent situation that would require Joe to remember his address. If he couldn't have a pizza delivered, he would likely feel embarrassed or frustrated and would be motivated to remember his address to avoid a similar situation in the future. On the other hand, making up a rhyme that includes his phone number may not necessarily help him remember his address, as the two pieces of information are unrelated."}}
{"Q": "Nadia needed new ballet shoes. Which event could cause After her first dance show, she paid him back?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nadia's friend gifted her the money for new shoes. (B) A friend bought Nadia a pair.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) A friend bought Nadia a pair.\nExplanation: Since Nadia needed new ballet shoes, it is more plausible that a friend bought her a pair after her first dance show. It is less likely that Nadia's friend gifted her the money for new shoes, as it would take some time for Nadia to go out and buy the shoes herself. Additionally, it is common for friends to give gifts after a successful performance, making it more likely that a friend bought Nadia a pair of ballet shoes."}}
{"Q": "Michael loved to play basketball, but wasn't very good. Which event could cause He made the team and went on to be a star?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Matthew read the basketball rules and practiced the game. (B) He practiced and tried out for a role.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He practiced and tried out for a role.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Michael's hard work and dedication to practicing basketball paid off when he tried out for the team. By practicing and improving his skills, he was able to impress the coaches and earn a spot on the team. This scenario is more likely than Matthew simply reading the rules and practicing, as basketball requires physical skill and practice, not just knowledge of the rules."}}
{"Q": "Mike was an incredible Chess player. Which event could cause Joseph won the chess game and Mike was humbled?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike entered a contest partnering with Joseph. (B) Joseph could tell Mike was playing too over-confidently.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joseph won the chess game and humbled Mike because he could tell that Mike was playing too over-confidently. Even the best chess players can make mistakes if they become too confident and underestimate their opponent. It is less likely that Mike would enter a contest partnering with Joseph, as he was known to be an incredible chess player and would likely want to compete on his own."}}
{"Q": "Lisa was going home. Which event could cause The next day Lucy missed Lisa when she saw their drawings?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) All flights were grounded to Lisa couldn't leave for a couple of days. (B) Lucy shared supplies in art class with Lisa, they bonded.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) All flights were grounded to Lisa couldn't leave for a couple of days.\nExplanation: If all flights were grounded, Lisa would have been unable to leave and would have had to stay for a few more days. This would have given Lucy more time to bond with Lisa and miss her the next day when she saw their drawings. On the other hand, option (B) is not a plausible answer as bonding over shared supplies in art class would not necessarily lead to Lucy missing Lisa the next day when she saw their drawings."}}
{"Q": "Martha was a terrible cook and her boyfriend knew it. Which event could cause After a while, everything Martha cooked was delicious?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Martha's boyfriend enrolled himself in cooking classes. (B) Martha worked hard to learn some recipies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Martha worked hard to learn some recipes.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Martha improved her cooking skills by putting in effort to learn some recipes rather than her boyfriend enrolling in cooking classes. Martha's own effort and dedication to improving her cooking would have a greater impact on her skills than her boyfriend's actions."}}
{"Q": "Lucy was at home waiting for her husband. Which event could cause Lucy's husband was excited and thrill?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her husband did not expect Lucy to be home yet. (B) she couldn't wait to tell him she wanted a divorce.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her husband did not expect Lucy to be home yet.\nExplanation: This event could cause Lucy's husband to be excited and thrilled because it could mean that he has a surprise planned for her or he is looking forward to spending time with her without any interruptions. On the other hand, option B is unlikely to cause excitement and thrill as it involves a negative and serious topic like divorce."}}
{"Q": "Kelsi was new at school and wanted to make new friends. Which event could cause Lucy was happy she was able to have a best friend finally?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelsi and Thomas met at school. (B) Kelsi saw Lucy was reading the same book she was.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kelsi saw Lucy was reading the same book she was.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kelsi and Lucy bonded over a shared interest in a book, as this is a common way for people to connect and start a conversation. Meeting someone new at school (choice A) may not necessarily lead to an immediate close friendship, whereas finding a common interest can create a strong bond. Therefore, it is more likely that Lucy was happy to have found a best friend in Kelsi after discovering they both enjoyed the same book."}}
{"Q": "I saved up money for a long time. Which event could cause I took the boat out on the lake and felt happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) i had enough money to spend on food and extra stuff. (B) I bought my dream cat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the person had saved up money for a long time, it is more likely that having enough money to spend on food and extra stuff would make them happy and allow them to enjoy their time on the boat without worrying about finances. Buying a dream cat may also bring happiness, but it is not directly related to the experience of being on a boat on a lake."}}
{"Q": "Jake had a new toy Spiderman silly string web slinger. Which event could cause Dan's mother posted photo's on Facebook of Dan covered in silly strin?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jake immediately threw his new toy in the trash. (B) Jake decided Dan was the Green Goblin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Jake immediately threw his new toy in the trash.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jake felt guilty or embarrassed about covering Dan in silly string and decided to get rid of the toy to prevent any further accidents. Dan's mother posting photos on Facebook could have been the trigger for Jake to realize the consequences of his actions and take responsibility for them. On the other hand, option (B) is less likely as it suggests Jake has a wild imagination and is unable to distinguish between reality and fantasy."}}
{"Q": "Margo was going to the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Which event could cause Eventually, the show was over?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Margo sat down to watch. (B) Margo left the show.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Margo left the show.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Margo leaving the show would cause it to eventually be over, rather than her simply sitting down to watch. The show would continue regardless of whether or not Margo was sitting down, but if she were to leave, it could potentially disrupt the flow of the performance and cause it to end prematurely."}}
{"Q": "Barry loves playing baseball. Which event could cause Barry also bought a hot dog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Barry's team won the game today. (B) Barry went to the bar for a game.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Barry's team won the game today.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Barry would buy a hot dog to celebrate his team's victory rather than buying a hot dog while going to a bar to watch a game. Buying a hot dog after a win is a common way to celebrate and enjoy the moment."}}
{"Q": "Erina's first day at her new job was today. Which event could cause Her new boss complimented her on her performance?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Erina gave it her all and did well. (B) Erina took too many breaks the first day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Erina gave it her all and did well.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Erina's boss would compliment her on her performance if she did well and put in effort on her first day. Taking too many breaks would not be a positive performance indicator and would not likely result in a compliment from her boss."}}
{"Q": "Penny was five Year's old and loved to play video games. Which event could cause The screen cracked and she was unable to play for a month?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Penny dropped her game on accident. (B) She accidentally sold her game console.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Penny dropped her game on accident.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Penny accidentally dropped her game console, causing the screen to crack and making it impossible for her to play for a month. Accidentally selling her game console would not cause the screen to crack and would result in her being unable to play indefinitely, not just for a month."}}
{"Q": "Amy went to get frozen yogurt on her break. Which event could cause Amy ended up throwing most of the yogurt in the trash?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy robbed the frozen yogurt store and ate all of the yogurt. (B) Amy was called back to work and her frozen yogurt melted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Amy's frozen yogurt melted due to being called back to work, causing her to throw most of it in the trash. It is unlikely that Amy would rob the store and eat all of the yogurt, as this is illegal and unethical behavior."}}
{"Q": "Ellen wanted to know if she could wear leggings while tap dancing. Which event could cause Ellen decided to wear whatever she wanted in the future?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ellen realized that she could. (B) Ellen was told there was a dress code.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Ellen was told there was a dress code.\n\nExplanation: If Ellen was told there was a dress code that prohibited leggings, she may decide to wear whatever she wants in the future if she disagrees with the dress code or feels that it is too restrictive. On the other hand, if Ellen realized that she could wear leggings while tap dancing, she may not necessarily feel the need to wear whatever she wants in the future since she already knows that leggings are an acceptable option. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lily wanted a new Halloween costume. Which event could cause She ended up making a rabbit costume?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lily decided to make her costume a bear costume. (B) All the costumes were gone though.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) All the costumes were gone though.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because if all the costumes were gone, Lily would have had to come up with a new idea for her costume. Making a rabbit costume could have been a creative solution to the problem of not being able to find a pre-made costume. Choosing to make a bear costume instead (option A) would not explain why Lily ended up with a rabbit costume."}}
{"Q": "Once there was a girl named Mia who could spell well. Which event could cause Mia won the spelling bee and felt more sure of herself afterwards?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She studied hard because she wanted to spell. (B) Mia entered the spelling bee but didn't practice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) She studied hard because she wanted to spell.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mia won the spelling bee because she studied hard and prepared for it. If she didn't practice and just entered the spelling bee, it is unlikely that she would have won. Studying hard and preparing for the competition would have given her more confidence and made her feel more sure of herself afterwards."}}
{"Q": "Everyone at my bus stop were waiting for the bus. Which event could cause My teacher told me to stand outside since I came too late?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bus was late and so was I to school. (B) bus showed up early and I was late for class.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The bus was late and so was I to school.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if the bus was late, it would have caused the students to be waiting at the bus stop for a longer period of time, which could have resulted in the student being late for school. Additionally, if the student was late for school, it would make sense for the teacher to ask them to wait outside as a consequence. On the other hand, if the bus showed up early and the student was late for class, it would not necessarily explain why everyone at the bus stop was waiting for the bus."}}
{"Q": "Jean wanted to travel to Africa. Which event could cause Jean's trip to Africa was better than she had hoped?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jean booked her trip and went. (B) Jean ended up having a bad time in Africa.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jean booked her trip and went.\nExplanation: If Jean booked her trip and went, it means that she had a plan and expectation of what she wanted to experience in Africa. If her trip turned out better than she had hoped, it could mean that she had amazing experiences, met great people, saw incredible sights, and had an overall positive experience. On the other hand, if Jean had a bad time in Africa, it would not be better than she had hoped. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mary had never made rice before. Which event could cause She resolved to read directions next time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary ended up overcooking the pasta. (B) The rice Mary put on the stove out over and burned on the stove.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Mary put the rice on the stove and it burned, it would be a clear indication that she did not know how to cook rice properly. This would likely prompt her to read the directions next time to avoid making the same mistake again. Overcooking pasta (choice A) is not directly related to cooking rice, so it is less likely to cause Mary to resolve to read directions for rice specifically."}}
{"Q": "Brad woke up late this morning. Which event could cause He had worn 2 different pairs of shoes to work this morning?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Brad rushed to work. (B) He was in such a slow mood, he didn't dress correctly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Brad rushed to work.\nExplanation: If Brad woke up late, he may have been in a hurry to get ready and out the door on time. This could have led to him not paying close attention to what he was putting on his feet and accidentally wearing two different pairs of shoes. On the other hand, option B suggests that Brad was intentionally not dressing correctly, which is less likely to be the cause of wearing two different shoes."}}
{"Q": "I was getting ready to leave my hotel room for the day. Which event could cause I was relieved that it was only a drill?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I left all my stuff out on the bed. (B) I heard loud fire alarm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Hearing a loud fire alarm would be a more plausible event that could cause relief that it was only a drill. Leaving all your stuff out on the bed may be inconvenient, but it wouldn't necessarily cause relief that it was only a drill. A fire alarm, on the other hand, would indicate a potential emergency and the relief that it was only a drill would be a natural response."}}
{"Q": "For a lark I started dragging my foot behind me at work. Which event could cause He told me to knock it off?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My shoes made a really loud sound in front of my boss. (B) I fell and broke my leg.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the sound of the dragging foot was loud enough to draw attention, it could be seen as disruptive or unprofessional behavior in the workplace. This could prompt someone, such as a supervisor or coworker, to tell the person to stop. On the other hand, breaking a leg would likely result in concern and medical attention, rather than a reprimand for behavior."}}
{"Q": "Tony liked art. Which event could cause Tony then went back to school and found a different major?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) However, he was not very talented, and his hair did not sell very well. (B) Tony applies for a lot of art gallery jobs and got rejected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tony applies for a lot of art gallery jobs and got rejected.\nExplanation: If Tony was passionate about art but faced multiple rejections in his attempts to secure a job in the field, it could have caused him to reconsider his career path and explore other options. This is a more plausible scenario than option (A), which suggests that Tony's lack of talent and unsuccessful hair sales led him to abandon his love for art altogether."}}
{"Q": "I found a $600 dollar envelope in the mail today. Which event could cause I am honest?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I turned the $600 dollars to the authorities. (B) I returned the empty envelope to the person it was addressed to.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I returned the empty envelope to the person it was addressed to.\nExplanation: Returning the empty envelope to the person it was addressed to shows honesty because it demonstrates that the person did not keep the money for themselves and made an effort to return it to its rightful owner. Turning the money over to authorities could also be seen as honest, but it may not be the most practical solution as it could take longer for the money to be returned to its owner. Additionally, the authorities may not be able to locate the owner of the money if there is no identifying information on the envelope."}}
{"Q": "Becky has a nephew named Dominick. Which event could cause Becky and Dominick can now play Uno together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dominick moved his house away from Becky's house. (B) Dominick shifted their house near the Becky house so.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Dominick shifted their house near the Becky house so.\nExplanation: If Dominick's house is near Becky's house, it would be easier for them to meet and play Uno together. On the other hand, if Dominick moved his house away from Becky's house, it would be more difficult for them to meet and play Uno together. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was accidentally shot by his teammate in the army. Which event could cause He ends up being homeless?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom developed emotional problems affecting his division. (B) Tom was unable to find work being in a wheelchair.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom developed emotional problems affecting his division.\nExplanation: Being accidentally shot by a teammate in the army can be a traumatic experience, which can lead to emotional problems such as PTSD. If Tom's emotional problems affected his division, it could have resulted in him being discharged from the army. Without a stable income and support system, Tom could have ended up homeless. While being in a wheelchair could also make it difficult for Tom to find work, emotional problems affecting his division seem like a more plausible reason for him to end up homeless."}}
{"Q": "Tommy was having a bad day. Which event could cause Tommy had good friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tommy's friends cheered him up. (B) Tommy's friends didn't pay attention to him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tommy's friends cheered him up.\n\nExplanation: If Tommy's friends cheered him up, it shows that they care about him and want to make him feel better. This would indicate that Tommy has good friends who are supportive and empathetic. On the other hand, if Tommy's friends didn't pay attention to him, it could make him feel even worse and suggest that they are not good friends. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jay wanted to vote. Which event could cause That is, until he got older and did it again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jay wasn't sure how to vote. (B) Jay swore he'd never vote again.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Jay wasn't sure how to vote.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it suggests that Jay had an interest in voting but lacked knowledge or experience on how to do it. As he got older, he may have learned more about the voting process and felt more confident in his ability to participate in elections. On the other hand, (B) Jay swore he'd never vote again implies that Jay had a negative experience with voting in the past, which is less likely to motivate him to try again in the future."}}
{"Q": "I was really nervous before my first middle school dance. Which event could cause Now, she won't even talk to me?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My date threw up on me. (B) I threw up on my date.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My date threw up on me.\nExplanation: While both options are unpleasant, it is more plausible that the event causing the person to not talk to the narrator would be the result of their date throwing up on them. This could be embarrassing and potentially ruin the night, leading to the other person feeling uncomfortable and avoiding the narrator afterwards. On the other hand, if the narrator threw up on their date, it would still be unpleasant but it may not necessarily cause the other person to completely cut off communication."}}
{"Q": "My four-year-old nephew loves to wake us up. Which event could cause As I screamed, he yelled cold hands?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Today I was ready for him. When he came into our room a jumped out and tickled him. (B) He would jump on our ear to get our attention.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If the nephew is jumping on the person's ear to wake them up, it is likely that the person would scream in surprise or pain. The nephew yelling \"cold hands\" could be a way of taunting or teasing the person after waking them up in such a jarring manner. Option (A) does not involve any physical contact that would cause the person to scream or yell."}}
{"Q": "I loved to make my wife laugh. Which event could cause I started making her laugh again and she became happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The my wife became sad. (B) My husband was sad so I thought I would cheer her up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The my wife became sad.\nExplanation: It is more likely that if the wife became sad, the husband would try to cheer her up by making her laugh again. Making someone laugh is a common way to lift their mood and bring happiness back into their life. Therefore, it is plausible that the husband would try to make his wife laugh again if she became sad. On the other hand, if the husband was sad, it may not necessarily lead to him trying to make his wife laugh, as he may be too preoccupied with his own emotions."}}
{"Q": "Rachel was cooking dinner. Which event could cause Then she pulled herself together and took care of the cut?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rachel burned her hand. (B) She cut her finger when chopping vegetables.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She cut her finger when chopping vegetables.\nExplanation: If Rachel cut her finger while chopping vegetables, it would be a plausible event that could cause her to need to pull herself together and take care of the cut. Burning her hand could also be a painful and distracting event, but it may not necessarily require her to pull herself together in the same way as a cut."}}
{"Q": "Sam loved striped clothes. Which event could cause She began to wear stripes every day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam got lots of complaints about her clothing. (B) She decided to go out and buy and entire outfit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sam's love for striped clothes led her to decide to go out and buy an entire outfit, rather than getting complaints about her clothing. If she received complaints, it is more likely that she would try to change her style rather than continue to wear stripes every day."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy's phone ringed in class. Which event could cause As a result, she called the security guard to take him away?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He ended up getting in trouble. (B) Jimmy talked on the phone and wouldn't stop, delighting the professor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He ended up getting in trouble.\nExplanation: If Jimmy's phone rang in class and he didn't immediately turn it off or put it on silent, it would be considered a disruption to the class. If he continued to talk on the phone and refused to stop, it would be even more disruptive. This behavior could result in him getting in trouble with the teacher or school administration, and ultimately being removed from the class by the security guard."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was cooking dinner for her parents for the first time. Which event could cause Everyone laughed and they joked about it for years?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She severely undercooked the chicken and badly burned the potatoes. (B) Kelly's dinner was tasty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Severely undercooking the chicken and badly burning the potatoes would be a memorable and humorous event that could be joked about for years. It would also be a common mistake for someone cooking for the first time, making it a plausible answer. If Kelly's dinner was tasty, it would not be as memorable or noteworthy of an event."}}
{"Q": "Amber was scared about her future. Which event could cause She was no longer worried about her future?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amber talked to her academic advisor. (B) Amber talked to her psychic advisor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Amber talked to her academic advisor.\nExplanation: Talking to an academic advisor can provide guidance and support for future career and academic goals. They can offer advice on courses to take, internships to pursue, and potential career paths. This can help alleviate fears and uncertainties about the future. On the other hand, talking to a psychic advisor may not provide practical solutions or realistic advice, and may not address the root causes of Amber's fears. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The day of the big game had arrived. Which event could cause Terry scored 2 goals that day and got his team the victory?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terry practiced for a long time. (B) terry was so big.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Terry practiced for a long time.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Terry's hard work and dedication in practicing led to his success in scoring 2 goals and helping his team win the game. Being big may give him an advantage in some aspects of the game, but it is not the sole determining factor for success. Practice and skill are more important in achieving victory in sports."}}
{"Q": "Sara wanted a new puppy really badly. Which event could cause A raccoon sprang out and Sara never wanted an animal again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sara was outside looking at the neighbor's dog. (B) Sara was outside looking at the neighbor's underwear.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Sara was outside looking at the neighbor's dog and a raccoon suddenly sprang out, it could scare her and make her not want an animal again. However, if Sara was outside looking at the neighbor's underwear, it is unlikely that a raccoon would suddenly appear and scare her."}}
{"Q": "Monica was at the library with her boyfriend. Which event could cause She kicked them out because they were loitering?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Children brought food and left their trash laying on the reading table. (B) The librarian noticed Monica and her boyfriend were just hanging out reading.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The librarian noticed Monica and her boyfriend were just hanging out reading.\n\nExplanation: Loitering means lingering or hanging around without any purpose or reason. If Monica and her boyfriend were just hanging out and reading without actually using the library resources, it could be considered loitering. Therefore, it is more plausible that the librarian noticed this and asked them to leave rather than children leaving trash on the table."}}
{"Q": "When Jen is 10 years old she wants to wear makeup. Which event could cause Jen learns her lesson?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jen applied her mother's makeup and looked like a clown. (B) Jen's mother let her put on her own makeup but Jen's friends complimented her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Jen applies her mother's makeup and looks like a clown, she will likely learn that makeup application requires skill and practice. This experience may make her realize that she needs to learn how to apply makeup properly before wearing it in public. On the other hand, if Jen's mother lets her put on her own makeup and her friends compliment her, she may not learn the lesson that makeup requires skill and practice, and may continue to wear makeup without learning how to apply it properly."}}
{"Q": "Every night the alarm would go off at Ted's house. Which event could cause It turns out a stray cat set off the alarm?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He would run outside but nobody would be there. (B) Ted got sick of being woken up, so he stayed up all night to moved out of his house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the stray cat set off the alarm, causing Ted to run outside but nobody would be there, rather than Ted getting so fed up with the alarm that he immediately moves out of his house. It is more likely that Ted would try to find the cause of the alarm before taking such drastic action."}}
{"Q": "Neil had tried to see the Loch Ness Monster on his trip to Scotland. Which event could cause They said they did not believe in the monster at all?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They saw the monster themselves. (B) Neil asked the locals where to find it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) They saw the monster themselves.\n\nExplanation: If someone sees the Loch Ness Monster themselves, it is more likely that they would believe in its existence. Therefore, if someone said they did not believe in the monster at all, it could be because they did not see it themselves. Option (B) is not a plausible answer as asking locals for information about the monster does not necessarily affect one's belief in its existence."}}
{"Q": "I woke up one morning and went outside to grab the newspaper. Which event could cause I went outside and quickly grabbed my newspaper?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was a tornado outside. (B) It was raining and I did not want to get wet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It was raining and I did not want to get wet.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is a common occurrence for people to quickly grab their newspaper when it is raining outside to avoid getting wet. On the other hand, it is unlikely that someone would go outside during a tornado as it is dangerous and could cause harm."}}
{"Q": "Jim was incredibly tired one morning. Which event could cause After he woke up, he saw a steaming, boiling pot on the stove?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim's wife knew he was tired and made coffee. (B) jim made breakfast.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jim's wife knew he was tired and made coffee.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jim's wife, knowing that he was tired, made coffee for him and left the pot on the stove to keep it warm. It is less likely that Jim, who was incredibly tired, would have the energy to make breakfast and forget about the pot on the stove."}}
{"Q": "The family prepared the food and packed it away. Which event could cause The family had a horrible day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) After the picnic, it started raining. (B) Popped a tire and spent their picnic time waiting for a tow-truck.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Popped a tire and spent their picnic time waiting for a tow-truck.\nExplanation: This event could cause the family to have a horrible day because they were not able to enjoy their picnic as planned and had to spend their time waiting for a tow-truck. This could have been frustrating and disappointing for the family, leading to a negative experience overall. In contrast, while rain may have caused some inconvenience, it would not necessarily have ruined the entire day."}}
{"Q": "Tim never locked his bathroom window. Which event could cause Tim was glad he kept the window unlocked?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim was able to break through the window. (B) Tim lost his keys to the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Tim lost his keys to the house, he would be locked out and unable to enter through the front or back door. However, if he left his bathroom window unlocked, he could climb through it and enter his house. This makes option B a more plausible answer than option A, as breaking through a window is not typically a situation that would make someone glad they left it unlocked."}}
{"Q": "A friend of the family has an old farm. Which event could cause No sane dog chases a pack of wild coyotes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The people that live on the old farm has a dog that fears nothing. (B) There is an old dog on the farm who has lost its mind and barks all day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The people that live on the old farm has a dog that fears nothing.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the dog on the farm is fearless rather than having lost its mind and barking all day. Coyotes are known to be dangerous and a pack of them can easily overpower a single dog. Therefore, it is unlikely that a sane dog would chase after them. However, if the dog is fearless and has been trained to protect the farm, it may chase after the coyotes to protect its territory."}}
{"Q": "Oren needs to earn extra money for school. Which event could cause Oren feels great that he will be earning extra money?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Oren got a part time job delivering pizza. (B) he went inside and got a part time job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Oren got a part time job delivering pizza.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it specifically mentions that Oren will be earning extra money, which is his goal. Additionally, delivering pizza is a common part-time job that many students take on to earn extra income. It also implies that Oren will have some flexibility in his schedule, which is important for a student who needs to balance work and school. Option B is too vague and does not provide any information about how Oren will be earning money or what kind of job he will have."}}
{"Q": "Beth was a model in a fashion show at her school. Which event could cause Beth missed the show, and was unable to tell anyone she wasn't coming?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Beth passed out from overeating. (B) Beth went out and broke her phone with no ride home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Beth went out and broke her phone with no ride home.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because if Beth passed out from overeating, someone would have noticed and tried to contact her or get her medical attention. However, if Beth broke her phone and had no way to communicate, she would not be able to inform anyone that she couldn't make it to the fashion show. This situation is more realistic and could happen to anyone."}}
{"Q": "Overnight there was a huge lightning storm that knocked out the power. Which event could cause Everyone was late and had to hurry?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Everyone realized that the power was out for a long time. (B) When I awoke, I rolled over and saw the alarm clock flashing 6 o'clock and I knew I'd missed my interview.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If the narrator missed their interview because they overslept due to the power outage, it is likely that others also had trouble waking up on time and had to hurry to get to their appointments or work. Option A does not necessarily imply that people would be late, as they could have planned ahead for a power outage and made alternative arrangements."}}
{"Q": "Amelia wanted to be friends with Kiku. Which event could cause They had both wanted to be friends with each other?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were both very shy, but were attracted to eachother without even knowing!. (B) She went under to say hello.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They were both very shy, but were attracted to each other without even knowing!\n\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because it suggests that both Amelia and Kiku had a mutual desire to be friends, despite their shyness. It also implies that they may have had some sort of unspoken connection or chemistry that drew them to each other. Option B, on the other hand, is less likely as it doesn't provide any context or explanation for why Amelia would suddenly decide to say hello to Kiku."}}
{"Q": "A man was thrown out of every residence he could find. Which event could cause Now he is homeless, and society at large is poorer for it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) the man failed to get a job, until recently. (B) The man eventually gave up on looking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The man eventually gave up on looking.\nExplanation: If the man gave up on looking for a job and a place to live, it is likely that he faced multiple rejections and setbacks, which could have led to feelings of hopelessness and despair. This could have also resulted in him losing his sense of purpose and motivation, making it difficult for him to get back on his feet. As a result, he may have become homeless, which not only affects him but also has a negative impact on society as a whole. Homelessness can lead to increased crime rates, health issues, and a strain on social services, which can ultimately make society poorer."}}
{"Q": "Chad was recently visiting his sister for Christmas. Which event could cause Chad decided he would not be eating the piece of cake?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chad ate so much at dinner that he was getting heartburn, then his sister brought out a cake. (B) Chad didn't eat cause he had the flu.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Chad would not eat the cake because he was already feeling full and experiencing heartburn from eating too much at dinner. This is a common reason for people to decline dessert. On the other hand, if Chad had the flu, he would likely not be visiting his sister for Christmas and would not be able to eat anything due to illness. Therefore, option A is a more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "Amber loves to read. Which event could cause She went to the library instead?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ambers friends wanted to see her at the library one night. (B) Amber liked having a book in her hand.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Amber liked having a book in her hand.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly relates to Amber's love for reading. It is common for avid readers to prefer physical books over digital copies, and Amber's preference for holding a book could have motivated her to go to the library instead of meeting her friends there. On the other hand, it is less likely that Amber's friends would specifically want to see her at the library, as it is not a typical social gathering spot."}}
{"Q": "Dave decided he would wash his dad's car that weekend. Which event could cause His dad wasn't mad but told Dave to be careful next time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dave accidentally scratched his dad's car, but told him. (B) dave almost damaged the car while washing it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Dave accidentally scratched his dad's car but was honest and told him, his dad may not be happy about the scratch but would appreciate Dave's honesty. He would likely tell Dave to be more careful next time to avoid similar accidents. On the other hand, if Dave almost damaged the car while washing it, his dad may have been more upset and may have scolded Dave for not being careful. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Chloe loved the book she was reading. Which event could cause She went three pages without remembering what she read?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One night, Chloe had the tv on while she was reading her book. (B) The book couldn't get her attention.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. One night, Chloe had the TV on while she was reading her book.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Chloe got distracted by the TV while reading, causing her to lose focus and not remember what she read for three pages. It is less likely that the book itself couldn't get her attention, as she initially loved the book."}}
{"Q": "Mike was running out of closet space. Which event could cause Mike realized that he didn't have enough coat hangers?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mike kept getting more clothes. (B) Mike discovered excess coat hangers took up most of the closet space.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: If Mike discovered that excess coat hangers took up most of the closet space, it would be a clear indication that he didn't have enough space for his clothes. This would prompt him to realize that he needed to either get rid of some clothes or find a new storage solution. On the other hand, if Mike kept getting more clothes, he might not necessarily realize that he didn't have enough coat hangers until he tried to hang them up and ran out of space. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I took a shovel to the woods and buried my brother's birthday present. Which event could cause He had so much fun, that now it's an annual tradition?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I made a big game hunt for him to hunt in. (B) My brother was surprised on the birthday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. My brother was surprised on the birthday.\nExplanation: Burying a birthday present in the woods and having the recipient search for it can be a fun and unique way to surprise them. It is plausible that this experience could have been so enjoyable for the brother that it became an annual tradition. On the other hand, organizing a big game hunt would require a lot more planning and resources, making it less likely to become an annual tradition."}}
{"Q": "Mimi was an old lady when I met her. Which event could cause That's a little hard to believe since she is less than 5 feet tall?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mimi told me that she used to play pool. (B) Mimi told me she used to be a star basketball player.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mimi used to play pool, as height is not a significant factor in playing pool. On the other hand, being a star basketball player would require a certain level of height and physical ability, which may be unlikely for someone who is less than 5 feet tall."}}
{"Q": "A man was looking to adopt a new cat. Which event could cause He immediately adopted this cat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He went to a store for pets and saw a cute cat. (B) The man saw a pretty cat that really liked him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man would adopt a cat if he went to a store specifically for pets and saw a cute cat, rather than just stumbling upon a pretty cat that liked him. Going to a pet store shows that the man was actively seeking to adopt a cat, and seeing a cute cat would likely make him more inclined to adopt it."}}
{"Q": "Rona was doing research into natural language processing. Which event could cause Rona found it delicious, with a dash of pepper and a pinch of salt?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She went into the research to document her findings. (B) Rona took a break from her research and made some Kraft macaroni and cheese.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rona found the macaroni and cheese delicious after taking a break from her research and making it, rather than during her research documenting findings on natural language processing. The event of making and eating the macaroni and cheese is a more likely cause for her enjoyment of the dish."}}
{"Q": "Arnold was scared of rabbits. Which event could cause Arnold nearly fainted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A deer approached him. (B) Arnold's mother made rabbit soup for dinner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Arnold's mother made rabbit soup for dinner.\nExplanation: Since Arnold is scared of rabbits, the thought of eating them in soup form could be overwhelming for him and cause him to nearly faint. On the other hand, a deer approaching him may startle him, but it is not directly related to his fear of rabbits."}}
{"Q": "Billy wanted to become a doctor. Which event could cause He was so depressed, he became an alcoholic?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Instead, he spent his life chasing women and doing drugs. (B) Billy dropped out of school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Billy dropped out of school.\nExplanation: Dropping out of school could have caused Billy to feel like he had failed in his pursuit of becoming a doctor, leading to depression and potentially turning to alcohol as a coping mechanism. This scenario is more plausible than the alternative of Billy completely abandoning his dream and engaging in reckless behavior."}}
{"Q": "My sister was in an open relationship. Which event could cause My sister dumped him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My sister cheated on her boyfriend anyways. (B) My sister dumped the person she was in an open relationship with.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) My sister dumped the person she was in an open relationship with.\nExplanation: While cheating is a possibility, it is not necessarily a given in an open relationship. It is more likely that my sister simply decided to end the relationship for personal reasons, such as a lack of emotional connection or a desire for a more traditional monogamous relationship. Additionally, being in an open relationship does not necessarily mean that cheating is acceptable or expected. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My mom promised me that we would go to a restaurant on Friday. Which event could cause She apologized for being dishonest to me in the past?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She said the same thing last week so I didn't believe her. (B) My mom and me had a long talk there about the present.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that during the long talk with her child, the mother may have realized that she had been dishonest in the past and apologized for it. This event is unrelated to the promise of going to a restaurant on Friday."}}
{"Q": "Rick was an older man with a large family. Which event could cause He passed away while he was sleeping and had a smile on his face?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rick had lived a sad, boring life. (B) Rick's family visited him while he was ill.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Rick's family visited him while he was ill.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rick passed away with a smile on his face after spending time with his loved ones. The presence of family members can bring comfort and happiness to a person, especially during their final moments. It is less likely that Rick would have a smile on his face if he had lived a sad and boring life."}}
{"Q": "Simon noticed a moving truck in front of the house next door. Which event could cause He hung out with her all day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Simon's friend Ann was moving away. (B) Simon's friend Ann was moving in with him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Simon's friend Ann was moving away.\n\nExplanation: If Simon's friend Ann was moving away, it would make sense for Simon to spend the day with her before she leaves. On the other hand, if Ann was moving in with Simon, it wouldn't necessarily explain why Simon would spend the whole day with her. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The entire group of teens clambered into the raft. Which event could cause They had such an amazing time on the river that day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They were looking foward to going around the rapids. (B) they all spent rafting all day long and went home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They were looking forward to going around the rapids.\nExplanation: The fact that the entire group of teens clambered into the raft suggests that they were excited and eager to go on the river. The mention of rapids implies that they were seeking adventure and a thrill, which could lead to an amazing time. Spending all day rafting and going home may be enjoyable, but it does not necessarily guarantee an amazing time. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sara worked very hard as a restaurant manager. Which event could cause She was able to quit her management job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she went to school at night and got a degree in computer programming. (B) Sara won nothing in the lottery.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sara was able to quit her management job because she went to school at night and got a degree in computer programming, which would allow her to pursue a career in a different field. Winning nothing in the lottery is not a realistic event that would lead to quitting a job."}}
{"Q": "Ada was emptying the trash one night. Which event could cause Ada had to pick up all the trash from the floor?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) the bag broke as Ada was walking out the door. (B) The trash bag ripped open from a hole in the top.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The trash bag ripped open from a hole in the top.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the trash bag ripped open from a hole in the top because bags can sometimes have weak spots or holes that can cause them to tear. Walking out the door would not necessarily cause the bag to break unless it was already weakened or overloaded."}}
{"Q": "Steve was concerned because his bills were piling up. Which event could cause Before long Steve was paying all his bills on time and was debt free?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Steve was paying too much money on late fees. (B) Steve decided to get a job paying minimum wage.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Steve was paying too much money on late fees.\n\nExplanation: If Steve's bills were piling up, it is likely that he was not paying them on time and incurring late fees. By addressing this issue and making sure to pay his bills on time, Steve would be able to avoid these fees and start making progress towards paying off his debts. Getting a job paying minimum wage may help increase his income, but it would not necessarily address the root cause of his debt problem."}}
{"Q": "Bruce was scared of the dark. Which event could cause Bruce was so grateful he kissed Jim full on the lips?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bruce asked Jim to turn on the lights. (B) Jim found lighter and lit a few candles for him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jim found a lighter and lit a few candles for him.\nExplanation: If Bruce was scared of the dark, it is more plausible that he would be grateful and relieved if Jim found a lighter and lit some candles for him, providing some light and comfort in the darkness. Asking Jim to turn on the lights may not have been enough to alleviate Bruce's fear of the dark, whereas the candles would have provided a more tangible source of light and comfort."}}
{"Q": "We were all getting tired after a long day at Magic Kingdom. Which event could cause We figured we would be able to come back another day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We decided to leave. (B) We stayed an extra 3 hours for fun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We decided to leave.\nExplanation: If everyone was getting tired after a long day at Magic Kingdom, it is more plausible that they would decide to leave and come back another day when they are more rested and able to enjoy the park fully. Staying an extra 3 hours for fun would only add to their exhaustion and may not be enjoyable for everyone."}}
{"Q": "The family prepared the food and packed it away. Which event could cause The family had a good day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The family saved it for the party the next day. (B) They then left for their picnic but left the food at home on accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The family saved it for the party the next day.\nExplanation: If the family saved the food for a party the next day, it suggests that they had a plan and were looking forward to spending time with loved ones. This could contribute to a good day for the family. On the other hand, if they left the food at home on accident, it could cause frustration and disappointment, which would not lead to a good day. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sally and Susan were looking forward to a night out. Which event could cause They went back to their apartment and watched movies instead?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) after two hours the club was empty almost with no people. (B) Sally had no money to go.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sally had no money to go.\n\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because if Sally didn't have any money to go out, then they wouldn't have been able to go to the club or do any other expensive activity. It's a common situation that can happen to anyone, and it's understandable that they would choose to stay in and watch movies instead. On the other hand, if the club was empty after two hours, it's less likely that they would have gone back to their apartment to watch movies instead of finding another place to go."}}
{"Q": "My teacher gave us instructions for the co-op assignment. Which event could cause However, my teacher gave me full credit while she received an F?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My partner did no work. (B) My friend and I didn't do the project together.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If the teacher gave full credit to a student who did not do any work, it is likely that the other partner did not contribute at all. This would cause the teacher to give the other partner an F for not fulfilling their part of the assignment. On the other hand, if the two friends did not work together, it would be unlikely for one to receive full credit while the other received an F."}}
{"Q": "A couple was having a baby in two months. Which event could cause The father agreed that it was a great name?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mother suggested naming the baby after a poorly named close friend. (B) The mother suggested naming the baby Aaron.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The mother suggested naming the baby Aaron.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the father would agree that naming the baby Aaron is a great name since it is a common and well-liked name. On the other hand, naming the baby after a poorly named close friend would not be a desirable option for the father."}}
{"Q": "Tom hiked a mountain. Which event could cause Tom upset his wife?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He stayed on a hiking trip longer than he planned. (B) He got impatient with his dog during the hike.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He stayed on a hiking trip longer than he planned.\nExplanation: If Tom stayed on the hiking trip longer than he planned, he may have missed important family events or responsibilities, causing his wife to be upset with him. On the other hand, getting impatient with his dog during the hike may not be as significant of an issue for his wife."}}
{"Q": "Six year old Bobby wanted a cat very badly. Which event could cause Bobby stopped liking cats after that day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An alley cat scratched Bobby on the hand. (B) Bobby's friend scratched him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bobby would stop liking cats if he was scratched by an alley cat, rather than his friend. Bobby may associate the pain and fear from the scratch with all cats, rather than just his friend's behavior. Additionally, if Bobby's friend scratched him, it may be more likely that he would stop liking his friend, rather than cats in general."}}
{"Q": "Harold was making some coffee before work. Which event could cause He discovered the milk had gone so bad that it was pouring out chunks?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He loved cream and sugar in his coffee. (B) Harold grabbed orange juice from the fridge.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He loved cream and sugar in his coffee.\nExplanation: If Harold loved cream and sugar in his coffee, he would have gone to the fridge to get the milk. Upon pouring it into his coffee, he would have discovered that the milk had gone bad and was pouring out chunks. This is a more plausible answer than (B) because it is unlikely that Harold would have grabbed orange juice from the fridge when he was making coffee."}}
{"Q": "Amy decided to try eyebrow waxing. Which event could cause Amy was happy she tried it since it was quicker than plucking?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy did the waxing quickly. (B) Amy found that it didn't work for her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Amy did the waxing quickly.\nExplanation: If Amy found that the waxing was quicker than plucking, it would make sense that she did the waxing quickly. If she took her time with the waxing, she may not have found it to be quicker than plucking. On the other hand, if Amy found that it didn't work for her, she would not be happy she tried it regardless of how quickly she did it. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lily lived in a disheveled, old apartment. Which event could cause Lily finally said goodbye to the apartment on moving day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lily decided to move to an old apartment. (B) Lily found a new apartment and decided to move out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lily found a new apartment and decided to move out.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lily would say goodbye to her old apartment on moving day because she found a new apartment and decided to move out. If Lily had decided to move to an old apartment, it wouldn't necessarily mean she would leave her current apartment. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely reason for Lily to say goodbye to her old apartment."}}
{"Q": "Neil had been journeying through Asia. Which event could cause He had always wanted to go surfing under the California sun?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Neil thought about traveling some more. (B) Neil decided he loved Asia so much that he stayed there.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Neil thought about traveling some more.\nExplanation: Since Neil had been journeying through Asia, it is plausible that he may have developed a sense of adventure and a desire to continue exploring new places. Therefore, it is more likely that he would want to go surfing under the California sun as part of his ongoing travels rather than deciding to stay in Asia permanently."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was happy to have her new phone. Which event could cause The store gave her a fair price to fix it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly cracked the phone on the screen. (B) Kelly cracked the screen on the phone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Kelly had cracked the screen on her phone, it would make sense for her to be happy that the store gave her a fair price to fix it. However, if she had cracked the phone itself, it would likely be more expensive to fix and may not result in her feeling happy about the situation."}}
{"Q": "Beth's brother Jake came to her house to check on a noise. Which event could cause Jake slept on the couch to keep her safe?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jake couldn't find the source of the noise so Beth remained afraid. (B) Jake was scared to go to sleep alone in the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jake slept on the couch because he was scared to go to sleep alone in the house, rather than because he couldn't find the source of the noise. If Jake was scared to be alone, he may have wanted to stay with Beth to make her feel safer as well. On the other hand, if he couldn't find the source of the noise, it may not necessarily mean that Beth would remain afraid, as the noise could have been something harmless."}}
{"Q": "Sam was in her 9th period class. Which event could cause She ended up doodling until it was time to go?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam got very bored. (B) Sam was very excited.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sam got very bored.\nExplanation: If Sam got very excited, she would be more likely to pay attention and engage in the class rather than doodling. On the other hand, if she got bored, she may have lost interest in the lesson and resorted to doodling as a way to pass the time. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Morgan wanted to hold a tea party. Which event could cause Morgan is already planning her next great tea party?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Morgan's first political party was memorable!. (B) Morgan's first tea party was memorable!.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Morgan's first tea party being memorable suggests that she enjoyed the experience and may want to plan another one in the future. Morgan's first political party being memorable does not necessarily relate to her desire to plan another tea party."}}
{"Q": "I found a $600 dollar envelope in the mail today. Which event could cause I am dishonest?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I donated all of the money to charity. (B) I decided to keep it even if it wasn't mine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I decided to keep it even if it wasn't mine.\nExplanation: Keeping someone else's money without attempting to return it is considered dishonest behavior. Donating the money to charity would be an honest and ethical decision."}}
{"Q": "Elizabeth bought four fish from the pet store. Which event could cause Elizabeth had to give many of the fish away to new homes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Elizabeth's fish tank was too fat. (B) Elizabeth noticed they had babies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Elizabeth's fish tank was too small.\nExplanation: If Elizabeth's fish tank was too small, the fish would not have enough space to swim and grow properly. This could lead to health problems for the fish and potentially overcrowding. In order to ensure the well-being of the fish, Elizabeth may need to give some away to new homes where they can have more space to thrive. On the other hand, if Elizabeth noticed that her fish had babies, she may choose to keep them or give them away, but it would not necessarily require her to give away any of the original four fish she purchased."}}
{"Q": "Tina's friend was making some guacamole. Which event could cause Tina decided to make it herself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tina really messed it up. (B) Tina watched her friend. Her friend didn't even peel the avocados.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Tina watched her friend make guacamole without even peeling the avocados, she may have realized that it's not a difficult task and decided to make it herself. This event is more plausible than Tina really messing it up, as it's unlikely that she would want to try again if she failed at making it."}}
{"Q": "Greg loves girl scout cookies. Which event could cause He is immediately regretful?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Greg eats too few girl scout cookies. (B) Greg tried a new flavor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Greg tries a new flavor of girl scout cookies and doesn't like it, he may be immediately regretful for not sticking with his usual favorite flavor. Eating too few girl scout cookies may not cause immediate regret, but rather disappointment that he didn't get to enjoy more of them."}}
{"Q": "Glenn decided to try a new mexican restaurant. Which event could cause Needless to say Glenn was satisfied with his new experience?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was cheap and very delicious. (B) The restaurant served lasagna.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Since Glenn went to a Mexican restaurant, it is more likely that he would be satisfied if the food was cheap and delicious, as this would indicate that the restaurant served authentic and tasty Mexican cuisine. The fact that the restaurant served lasagna (option B) would not be relevant to Glenn's satisfaction with his experience at a Mexican restaurant."}}
{"Q": "Johnny had a confession for a priest. Which event could cause The priest told Johnny women make sinners of us all?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Johnny told the priest about a dog. (B) Johnny told the priest he cheated on his wife.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the priest would make such a statement if Johnny confessed to cheating on his wife, as adultery is considered a sin in many religions and the priest may have been emphasizing the importance of avoiding temptation. Confessing about a dog would not likely lead to such a statement."}}
{"Q": "Alec works at the renaissance fair. Which event could cause They had to make it seem like part of the act?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alec jumped up in front of everyone. (B) Alec's phone started ringing during a performance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Alec's phone started ringing during a performance.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alec's phone ringing during a performance could cause them to make it seem like part of the act, as it is a common occurrence in modern times and could easily be explained as a comedic or dramatic element of the performance. On the other hand, Alec jumping up in front of everyone could be seen as disruptive and not easily incorporated into the act."}}
{"Q": "Matt wanted to go back in time. Which event could cause He never succeeded because time travel is probably impossible?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) matt had a drug problem but decided to try to build a time machine. (B) He built a time machine and went back to 1800.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that Matt built a time machine and went back to 1800, but he never succeeded because time travel is probably impossible. This is a more plausible answer because it is based on the assumption that time travel is not possible, which is a widely accepted scientific theory. On the other hand, the idea that Matt had a drug problem but decided to build a time machine is less plausible because it is not clear how a drug problem would lead to building a time machine."}}
{"Q": "In 2005 I took my first roller coaster ride in thirty years. Which event could cause It was a great ride and I am no longer afraid of roller coasters?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Since it had been so soon, I was a little afraid. (B) I thought it would be too scary and loud.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: Since the person had not been on a roller coaster in thirty years, it is understandable that they may have been a little afraid. However, since they enjoyed the ride and are no longer afraid of roller coasters, it is more plausible that their initial fear was overcome by the positive experience they had on the ride. Choice (B) may have been a concern before the ride, but it does not explain why the person is no longer afraid of roller coasters."}}
{"Q": "Today we went on a plane ride. Which event could cause I am no longer afraid of planes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We took a return flight back home and there was no turbulence. (B) I love planes. But we took off and wrecked.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: Taking a return flight back home with no turbulence is a positive experience that could help alleviate fear of planes. It shows that planes can safely transport passengers without any issues, and can help build confidence in flying. On the other hand, experiencing a plane crash (as described in option B) would likely reinforce or intensify a fear of planes."}}
{"Q": "Every Tuesday I meet my grandfather for coffee. Which event could cause Our coffee time ended early so he could go home and take a nap?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My grandfather was sleepy. (B) I got very tired.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) My grandfather was sleepy.\nExplanation: Since the statement mentions that the coffee time ended early so that the grandfather could go home and take a nap, it is more plausible that he was feeling sleepy and needed to rest. It is less likely that the narrator got tired since the focus is on the grandfather's need to leave early."}}
{"Q": "Kaya needed to buy a new dress for the upcoming Spring Formal. Which event could cause It was kind of expensive but she decided it was worth it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kaya saw a unique dress that would perfectly fit the Spring Formal occasion. (B) Kaya went shopping for her dress at the dollar store.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kaya saw a unique dress that would perfectly fit the Spring Formal occasion. \nExplanation: Kaya needed a dress for a special occasion, the Spring Formal, and it is reasonable to assume that she would want to look her best. If she found a unique dress that she loved and felt would be perfect for the occasion, it would make sense for her to decide that it was worth the expense. On the other hand, if she went to a dollar store to buy a dress, it is unlikely that she would find a dress that would be suitable for a formal event, and it would be less plausible for her to decide that it was worth the expense."}}
{"Q": "Sue needs a haircut. Which event could cause Sue goes home and cries about her haircut?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sue's hair was cut too lasting. (B) Sue went to a beauty school to get it cut.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sue's hair was cut too lasting.\nExplanation: If Sue's hair was cut too short, it could be a traumatic experience for her and cause her to cry. On the other hand, going to a beauty school to get a haircut is not necessarily a bad thing and may even result in a great haircut. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the outcome of the haircut."}}
{"Q": "A tree fell in Ray's backyard. Which event could cause Every time he opened the shed he recited the poem?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ray had to get the machine saw in the shed, but the door was hard to open. (B) Ray made the tree into a house and wrote a poem.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ray recited the poem every time he opened the shed because he had to struggle with the door, rather than him making a tree into a house and writing a poem. The former scenario is a more realistic and practical reason for reciting a poem repeatedly."}}
{"Q": "Timothy loved to dance. Which event could cause Everyone loved his dancing and he won the contest?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Timothy joined a dancing session. (B) Timothy participated in a dancing contest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Timothy participated in a dancing contest.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Timothy would win a dancing contest rather than just joining a dancing session. Contests usually have judges and criteria for judging, which means that Timothy's dancing skills would have been evaluated and recognized as exceptional. Additionally, winning a contest implies that Timothy stood out among other dancers, which would have garnered attention and admiration from the audience."}}
{"Q": "Eric got a new cell phone. Which event could cause The teacher laughed so much that he didn't care about punishing Eric?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eric's farting noise ringtone went off while he farted. (B) Erics phone rang in class.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Eric's farting noise ringtone going off while he farted is a more plausible answer because it is a humorous and unexpected event that could cause the teacher to laugh so much that they forget about punishing Eric. On the other hand, Eric's phone ringing in class is a common occurrence and would not necessarily cause the teacher to react in such a way."}}
{"Q": "Sarah woke early to do her chores around the house. Which event could cause Sarah's husband came home with flowers to cheer her up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sarah started laundry when the washer broke and the vacuum cleaner shorted out. (B) Sarah felt the cheeriest and happiest in ages.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Sarah started doing laundry and the washer broke, and then the vacuum cleaner shorted out, it could cause her to feel frustrated and overwhelmed. This could lead her husband to bring her flowers to cheer her up and show his appreciation for her hard work. On the other hand, option B does not provide any specific reason for Sarah's husband to bring her flowers."}}
{"Q": "Sam was riding the bus. Which event could cause After a while the music had him completely relaxed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The bus ran a red light and crashed into another car. (B) Sam was nervous about the bus ride.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sam was nervous about the bus ride.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sam's nervousness about the bus ride caused him to listen to music to relax. The event of the bus crashing into another car would likely cause stress and anxiety, rather than relaxation. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely cause of Sam's relaxation."}}
{"Q": "Ian was at his friend's house. Which event could cause Ian had to walk home in the dark?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He gladly took a ride home. He needed to get the exercise. (B) Ian stayed at his friends house too long and it was dark out when he left.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ian stayed at his friends house too long and it was dark out when he left.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is common for people to lose track of time when hanging out with friends and end up staying longer than intended. If Ian stayed at his friend's house too long, it would have been dark by the time he left, and he would have had to walk home in the dark. Option (A) is less likely because if Ian had the option to take a ride home, he would have most likely taken it instead of walking home in the dark."}}
{"Q": "Stu tore his sisters penguin plushie while arguing with her. Which event could cause When he them to his sister, she forgot about the penguin completely?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Stu didn't apologize. (B) Stu bought his sister a whole bunch of penguin plushies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Stu bought his sister a whole bunch of penguin plushies.\nExplanation: By buying his sister a whole bunch of penguin plushies, Stu is showing that he is sorry for tearing her favorite one. This act of kindness and apology could make his sister forgive him and forget about the torn penguin plushie."}}
{"Q": "Bob wanted a hamburger. Which event could cause Bob went out to McDonald's later that evening?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob waited patiently and resisted the urge to order online. (B) Bob got in a hurry and ran outside to go grab a burger.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Bob waited patiently and resisted the urge to order online, it is more likely that he would eventually decide to go out to McDonald's later that evening to satisfy his craving for a hamburger. On the other hand, if Bob got in a hurry and ran outside to go grab a burger, he might choose a closer or more convenient fast food restaurant instead of McDonald's."}}
{"Q": "John thought he was the best video game player ever. Which event could cause John learned he wasn't as good as he thought he was?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John challenged Benny and lost. (B) A lot people lost to John at video games.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John challenged Benny and lost.\nExplanation: If John challenged someone and lost, it would be a clear indication that he wasn't as good as he thought he was. Losing to one person would be more impactful than winning against a lot of people, as it would show that John's skills were not as superior as he believed."}}
{"Q": "Joey took his kite to the park. Which event could cause He had a great time flying his kite all afternoon?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The wind was brisk and the park was empty. (B) He let go of the string and the kite flew away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The wind was brisk and the park was empty.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because having a brisk wind would make it easier to fly the kite and enjoy the experience. Additionally, having the park empty would mean that Joey wouldn't have to worry about other people or obstacles getting in the way of his kite flying. On the other hand, letting go of the string and losing the kite would not result in a great time."}}
{"Q": "Chris wanted to try out for the school soccer team. Which event could cause Chris made the soccer team?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chris practiced before the tryouts. (B) The coach showed up to tryouts and impressed Chris.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Chris practiced before the tryouts.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Chris making the soccer team was a result of his preparation and hard work through practicing before the tryouts. This would have given him the necessary skills and confidence to perform well during the tryouts and catch the coach's attention. While the coach showing up and impressing Chris could have been a motivating factor, it is not a guarantee that Chris would have made the team solely based on that."}}
{"Q": "Ronald had a girlfriend named Stephanie. Which event could cause Ronald didn't care, he was planning to kill Stephanie later?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ronald hated Stephanie very much. (B) Stephanie loved Ronald very much.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ronald hated Stephanie very much.\nExplanation: If Ronald had a strong hatred towards Stephanie, it could lead him to plan to harm or kill her. This is a more plausible reason than Stephanie loving Ronald, as love is not typically a motive for murder. Hatred, on the other hand, can be a powerful motivator for violent actions."}}
{"Q": "They reached the eastern boundary of the wilderness at noon. Which event could cause Zeke sold the images to doctor offices for a tidy sum of money?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Zeke took many pictures of the beautiful scenery. (B) Zeke took videos of local animals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Zeke took many pictures of the beautiful scenery.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Zeke sold images of the beautiful scenery he captured during their journey through the wilderness, as they reached the eastern boundary at noon, indicating that they had been traveling for a while and had ample opportunity to take pictures. On the other hand, there is no indication that Zeke took videos of local animals, and even if he did, it is less likely that doctor offices would be interested in purchasing them."}}
{"Q": "Alex needed groceries. Which event could cause She bought the groceries?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She went to the grocery store. (B) Alex went to the auto shop.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She went to the grocery store.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alex bought groceries because she went to the grocery store, rather than going to the auto shop. The auto shop is not a place where one would typically buy groceries, so it is unlikely that Alex would have bought groceries there. On the other hand, the grocery store is a common place to buy groceries, so it is more likely that Alex went there to buy what she needed."}}
{"Q": "Joe went to the movie theater to see the new movie. Which event could cause Joe casually walked into the movie and gave a sigh?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The movie theater didn't have tickets for the new movie. (B) Joe was full of lots of energy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The movie theater didn't have tickets for the new movie.\nExplanation: If the movie theater didn't have tickets for the new movie, Joe might have been disappointed and let out a sigh as he walked in. This is a more plausible explanation than Joe being full of energy and randomly sighing as he walked into the movie."}}
{"Q": "Audrey was afraid to try new foods. Which event could cause Audrey surprisingly fell in love with their restaurant and food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Audrey decided to work up the courage to try a new store near her house. (B) Audrey went to a new style of restaurant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Audrey went to a new style of restaurant.\nExplanation: Trying a new style of restaurant could expose Audrey to different types of cuisine and flavors that she may not have tried before. This could potentially lead to her discovering a new favorite restaurant and food, despite her initial fear of trying new things. Working up the courage to try a new store near her house may not necessarily involve trying new foods, so it may not have the same impact on Audrey's fear of trying new foods."}}
{"Q": "Tony was making a pizza in his restaurant. Which event could cause Tony grabbed his special fire extinguisher, and put out the flames?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tony forgot about the pizza while prepping the chicken, and it burned up and it tasted really bad. (B) Tony placed the pizza in the oven without setting a timer. His pizza caught flames after an hour of cooking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tony's pizza caught flames due to him forgetting to set a timer and leaving it in the oven for too long. This is a common mistake that can happen in a busy restaurant kitchen. In this scenario, Tony would need to use his special fire extinguisher to put out the flames and prevent any further damage or danger. On the other hand, burning chicken may not necessarily require the use of a fire extinguisher and would not be as urgent of a situation."}}
{"Q": "George hated going to school. Which event could cause She was very upset and took George home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) George Playedx hooky all time and lied to Sara.People don't lik. (B) George refused to get out of the anti-ride at school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: George refusing to get out of the anti-ride at school seems like a more plausible event that could cause his mother, Sara, to be upset and take him home. This behavior could be seen as disruptive and potentially dangerous, leading to Sara's concern for George's safety and well-being. On the other hand, George playing hooky and lying to Sara may not necessarily result in her taking him home, and it is unclear why people not liking him would lead to this outcome."}}
{"Q": "Everyone in my family got together for Thanksgiving. Which event could cause We all eventually couldn't stop arguing with one another?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My family disagreed about politics. (B) My one another did not get along well with family.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My family disagreed about politics.\nExplanation: Politics can be a sensitive and divisive topic, especially during a time when emotions are already heightened, such as during a family gathering. It is not uncommon for disagreements about politics to escalate into arguments and heated debates, which can ultimately lead to tension and conflict among family members. On the other hand, while it is possible for one family member to not get along well with others, it is less likely to cause a widespread argument among everyone in the family."}}
{"Q": "Kim loves to swim. Which event could cause She saved up enough and now has a pool in her backyard?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kim decided to get a backyard. (B) Kim got a second job and banked all her paychecks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kim got a second job and banked all her paychecks.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kim saved up enough money to buy a pool by working hard and saving her money rather than just randomly deciding to get a backyard. Getting a second job and banking all her paychecks would be a logical and realistic way for Kim to save up enough money to buy a pool."}}
{"Q": "Matt collected acorns. Which event could cause Matt happily gave all of his acorns to the hungry squirrel?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There was a squirrel scavenging for acorns next to Matt. (B) Matt saw a skinny girl.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that there was a squirrel scavenging for acorns next to Matt. This event would make it likely that Matt would give his acorns to the hungry squirrel, as he would see the squirrel's need for food and want to help. On the other hand, seeing a skinny girl may not necessarily be related to Matt's decision to give his acorns to the squirrel."}}
{"Q": "Kathy was responsible for buying the groceries. Which event could cause Now Kathy never goes shopping without planning and a list?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She always used to forget things. (B) Kathy spent a lot of money, and still does.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Kathy always used to forget things when she went grocery shopping, it would make sense for her to start planning and making a list to ensure she doesn't forget anything important. This event would be a logical reason for Kathy to change her shopping habits. On the other hand, if Kathy spent a lot of money on groceries but didn't have any issues with forgetting items, it wouldn't necessarily lead to her needing to plan and make a list for future shopping trips."}}
{"Q": "Ed liked to drink, but he often got carried away. Which event could cause Ed has not touched a drink since her birth, seven years ago?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ed didn't mind and continued to drink every night. (B) Ed wanted to be a good father when his daughter was born.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ed wanted to be a good father when his daughter was born.\nExplanation: It is plausible that the birth of his daughter could have been a turning point for Ed, causing him to reevaluate his drinking habits and make a conscious decision to stop drinking in order to be a responsible and present father. This event would have a strong emotional impact on Ed and could motivate him to make positive changes in his life. On the other hand, if Ed continued to drink every night despite the birth of his daughter, it is unlikely that he would have gone seven years without touching a drink."}}
{"Q": "The phone rang and I answered it. Which event could cause That's how I met your mother?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was a wrong number who had lovely voice. (B) It wasn't a girl named Sarah.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It wasn't a girl named Sarah.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the phone call was from someone who was not Sarah, which could lead to a conversation that eventually leads to meeting the mother. On the other hand, a wrong number with a lovely voice may not necessarily lead to meeting the mother."}}
{"Q": "Troy got a Great Dane pup last Friday. Which event could cause He's spent hours every day trying to train him since then?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The puppy was very kind. (B) The puppy tore up the pillows and destroyed his model airplane.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The puppy tore up the pillows and destroyed his model airplane.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Troy would spend hours every day trying to train his Great Dane pup if the puppy was misbehaving and causing damage to his belongings. This would indicate that the puppy needs to be trained to behave properly and not destroy things. If the puppy was very kind, there would be less of a need for extensive training and Troy may not need to spend as much time on it."}}
{"Q": "Greg was at home bored. Which event could cause Greg was happy he wasn't bored anymore?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Greg's friend came over to invite him to a class lecture. (B) Greg decided to go buy a video game.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Greg's friend came over to invite him to a class lecture.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it involves a social interaction and a potential opportunity for learning or intellectual stimulation. It also suggests that Greg has a friend who cares about him and wants to include him in activities, which could improve his mood and alleviate his boredom. Option B, on the other hand, only offers a temporary distraction and does not address the underlying cause of Greg's boredom."}}
{"Q": "Billy was five Year's old. Which event could cause Billy got a quarter from the tooth-fairy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) billy pulled one of his tooth. (B) He finally got his first tooth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Billy pulled one of his tooth.\n\nExplanation: The tradition of the tooth fairy is that when a child loses a tooth, they place it under their pillow at night and the tooth fairy comes to take the tooth and leaves a small amount of money in exchange. Therefore, it is more plausible that Billy received a quarter from the tooth fairy because he pulled one of his teeth rather than getting his first tooth, as it is unlikely that the tooth fairy would leave money for a child's first tooth."}}
{"Q": "Rita was having a very difficult time at work. Which event could cause Their relationships improved?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) For a time, her co-worker was challenging. (B) For a time, her co-worker reached out and helped.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) For a time, her co-worker reached out and helped.\n\nExplanation: If Rita's co-worker reached out and helped her during her difficult time at work, it could have improved their relationship. This act of kindness and support could have created a bond between them and increased trust and respect. On the other hand, if her co-worker was challenging, it could have made Rita's situation worse and strained their relationship further. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It had snowed the night before. Which event could cause Afterwards, he was able to successfully back out his car?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John had to shovel the rain on the driveway. (B) Bob dug his car out of the snow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Bob dug his car out of the snow.\nExplanation: Since it had snowed the night before, the most plausible event that could have allowed the person to successfully back out their car is if someone had cleared the snow from around the car. Option B states that Bob dug his car out of the snow, which would have cleared the way for the person to back out their car. Option A, on the other hand, mentions shoveling rain, which is not possible, making it an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gary had trouble drinking enough water throughout the day. Which event could cause He decided to ditch the alarm clock?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He tried using a receiver to remind him. (B) It felt like a chore to Gary to drink a glass of water every time his alarm went off.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It felt like a chore to Gary to drink a glass of water every time his alarm went off.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Gary found the alarm method to be too tedious and inconvenient. If he found it to be effective, he would not have ditched it. On the other hand, using a receiver to remind him (option A) could have been a more effective solution, but we do not have enough information to determine if Gary tried this method or not."}}
{"Q": "We went camping on time when I was younger. Which event could cause We made sure to not go back there again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A bug tried to enter our tent while we were sleeping. (B) it wasn't always the most fun times however.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: A bug trying to enter the tent while sleeping can be a very unpleasant experience and can cause discomfort and fear. It can also be a sign of poor camping conditions or lack of proper preparation, which could lead to other issues such as safety concerns or health hazards. Therefore, it is a more plausible reason for not wanting to go back to the same camping site again. Option B is not a specific event and does not provide a clear reason for not wanting to return to the camping site."}}
{"Q": "Sam loved breakfast. Which event could cause Sam decided to never eat waffles again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam made his waffles and had to eat so many that morning. (B) Sam accidentally burnt waffles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Sam had to eat so many waffles in one morning, it could cause him to feel sick or overwhelmed by the taste of waffles. This could lead to him deciding to never eat waffles again, even if he previously loved them. On the other hand, burning waffles is a common mistake and would not necessarily cause Sam to swear off waffles altogether."}}
{"Q": "Joe robbed a bank. Which event could cause Soon Joe got caught?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The workers didnt call the police. (B) Joe tried to excape.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Joe tried to escape, it would increase the chances of getting caught by the police. The workers not calling the police may delay the capture, but eventually, the authorities would find out about the robbery and start investigating. Therefore, Joe's attempt to escape would be a more plausible reason for his capture."}}
{"Q": "Jane lost her dog. Which event could cause Jane was glad and excited?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Someone hide the dog from her. (B) Jane then found her dog.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jane then found her dog.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jane would be glad and excited if she found her lost dog rather than someone hiding the dog from her. Finding her lost dog would bring relief and happiness to Jane, while someone hiding the dog would only cause more distress and confusion."}}
{"Q": "One day snow and ice covered the ground. Which event could cause Thankfully Jimmy was okay?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jimmy didn't notice and slipped on the ice. (B) Jimmy was careful not to slip on the snow and ice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jimmy was careful not to slip on the snow and ice.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Jimmy took precautions to avoid slipping on the snow and ice, which would have prevented him from getting hurt. On the other hand, if Jimmy didn't notice the snow and ice and slipped, it would have been an accident that could have caused him harm. Therefore, it is more likely that Jimmy's carefulness prevented any accidents and kept him safe."}}
{"Q": "One Saturday spring morning, I loaded up to play golf with the guys. Which event could cause When I visited him at the hospital, the nurse said he will be okay?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My friend got hit in the head by a falling acorn. (B) My friend got hit in the head by a gold ball.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My friend got hit in the head by a falling acorn.\nExplanation: While it is possible for someone to get injured by a golf ball, it is much more likely for someone to get hit by a falling acorn while outside in the spring. Additionally, the fact that the nurse said he will be okay suggests that the injury was not too severe, which is more likely with an acorn than a golf ball."}}
{"Q": "Ann loved cake. Which event could cause Ann came inside and watched as cakes were being made?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The local baker let Ann come into the workshop for a tour. (B) She passed by a meat shop one day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it involves Ann's love for cake and a logical reason for her to be inside watching cakes being made. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide any connection to Ann's love for cake and seems unlikely to lead to her watching cakes being made."}}
{"Q": "Max decides that he spends too much money buying food at restaurants. Which event could cause He is very happy to be saving money by cooking at home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Max found some great recipes to cook at home. (B) Max starts to learn how to drive stick shift.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Max found some great recipes to cook at home.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because finding great recipes to cook at home would give Max the motivation and inspiration to cook more often, leading to him saving money by not eating out at restaurants. Learning how to drive stick shift has no direct correlation to Max's spending habits on food."}}
{"Q": "There are two phases to body building. Which event could cause Apparently if you do these two things you will look amazing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A good diet isn't needed, just exercise. (B) It is important that you work on both phases.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It is important that you work on both phases.\nExplanation: Body building consists of two phases - building muscle mass and cutting body fat. Both phases are equally important in achieving a toned and muscular physique. Without a good diet, it is difficult to build muscle mass and without exercise, it is difficult to burn body fat. Therefore, it is important to work on both phases simultaneously to achieve the desired results."}}
{"Q": "Robbie was confused by his homework. Which event could cause Robbie felt lonely and sat down to cry?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Robbie kept getting different math answers for same problem. (B) Robbie stayed up all morning and couldn't finish it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Robbie kept getting different math answers for same problem.\nExplanation: This event could cause Robbie to feel confused and frustrated with his homework, leading to feelings of loneliness and helplessness. It is common for students to feel overwhelmed and stressed when they cannot understand a problem or find a solution, which can lead to emotional distress. In this case, Robbie's inability to solve the math problem could have triggered his emotional response and caused him to cry."}}
{"Q": "Luis wanted to make money when he grew up. Which event could cause Now he has a good paying job and a nice family?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Luis brother stuck to his goals in life. (B) Luis attended university and studied very hard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Luis attended university and studied very hard.\nExplanation: Attending university and studying hard is a common path to obtaining a good paying job. By pursuing higher education, Luis likely gained the skills and knowledge necessary to secure a well-paying job and provide for his family. While having a supportive family member like a brother can be helpful, it is not necessarily the determining factor in achieving financial success."}}
{"Q": "Tom was looking through his pantry for a snack. Which event could cause The bug crawled away and Tom lost his appetite?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He saw a huge bug crawl near him, and he hates bugs. (B) Tom found a coconut, but noticed that it had a worm hole.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Seeing a bug near him would likely cause Tom to lose his appetite, especially if he has a strong dislike for bugs. Finding a worm hole in a coconut may not necessarily cause him to lose his appetite, as he could simply cut off the affected area and still eat the rest of the coconut."}}
{"Q": "Debbie lost her mother when Debbie was only 15. Which event could cause Debbie lived a long a fulfilling life with her husband and 4 boys?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Debbie met a man. (B) Debbie got over her own death.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Debbie met a man.\nExplanation: Meeting a supportive and loving partner can provide emotional stability and a sense of security, which can help individuals cope with the loss of a loved one. Having a strong support system can also help individuals navigate the challenges of life and achieve their goals. While it is important to work through grief and heal from the loss of a loved one, it is unlikely that someone can simply \"get over\" their own death. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Today was the first day of school. Which event could cause I hate school?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My teacher was mean and the other students laughed at my shirt. (B) I tried making tacos, but none seemed to like them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a negative social experience with a teacher and peers would cause someone to hate school, rather than a failed attempt at cooking tacos. Social interactions and relationships with teachers and peers can greatly impact a student's attitude towards school and their overall experience."}}
{"Q": "I approached the bridge in the rainy, rounding a curve. Which event could cause I really came to appreciate that day how well that bridge was built?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I almost drove off but stopped before crossing. (B) I suddenly skidded and hit the side of the bridge.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the road was wet and the driver was rounding a curve suggests that the conditions were not ideal for driving. If the driver almost drove off the bridge but was able to stop in time, it would highlight the importance of the bridge's construction and safety features. On the other hand, if the driver suddenly skidded and hit the side of the bridge, it would suggest that the bridge may not have been built well enough to prevent accidents. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John went on a camping trip with his brother Mark. Which event could cause At that moment, a skunk walked right into their tent?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At the camping site, the brothers unloaded their car, put up the tent, and rolled out the sleeping bags. (B) John and Mark set up with their tent left at home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: Option (A) is a more plausible answer as it describes the scenario where John and Mark have already set up their tent and are inside it, making it possible for a skunk to walk in. Option (B) states that the tent was left at home, making it impossible for a skunk to enter their tent."}}
{"Q": "Paul's car broke down shortly after leaving the driveway. Which event could cause Paul then realized attempting repairs yourself can be expensive?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Paul decided to get a mechanic instead of fixing it himself. (B) Paul's repair had completely fallen apart.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Paul decided to get a mechanic instead of fixing it himself.\nExplanation: Since Paul's car broke down shortly after leaving the driveway, it is unlikely that he had attempted any repairs before realizing that it can be expensive. Therefore, option A is more plausible as it suggests that Paul made a decision to get a mechanic after realizing that attempting repairs himself can be expensive. Option B is less likely as it suggests that Paul had attempted repairs and they had completely fallen apart, which is not mentioned in the given information."}}
{"Q": "Oscar never made his bed. Which event could cause She yelled at him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His room was a mess and his dad saw it. (B) Oscar's mom asked him to make his bed every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His room was a mess and his dad saw it.\nExplanation: If Oscar's room was a mess and his dad saw it, it is more likely that his mom would yell at him for not making his bed. This is because his dad seeing the mess could have caused his mom to feel embarrassed or frustrated, leading her to take it out on Oscar. On the other hand, if his mom asked him to make his bed every day, it is less likely that she would suddenly yell at him for not doing it, as it would be expected behavior."}}
{"Q": "Kayla was trying to come up with baby names for her baby. Which event could cause Now Kayla had a baby name they both liked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kayla’s husband hated all the names she mentioned. (B) Kayla went through the naming school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Kayla’s husband hated all the names she mentioned.\nExplanation: It is plausible that Kayla and her husband had different preferences for baby names, and it took some time for them to find a name they both liked. This is a common scenario for many couples when choosing a name for their baby. On the other hand, option (B) is not very plausible as there is no such thing as a \"naming school\" and it is unlikely that Kayla would have gone through such a program to come up with a baby name."}}
{"Q": "My friends and I went to six flags last weekend. Which event could cause I vowed to never go on it again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I vomited on the roller coaster. (B) I rode the roller coaster over and over.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Vomiting on a roller coaster is a common occurrence for people who are prone to motion sickness or have a weak stomach. It is a plausible reason for someone to vow to never go on that ride again. Riding a roller coaster over and over may be tiring or boring, but it is not a traumatic experience that would cause someone to swear off the ride forever."}}
{"Q": "Jane admired the music of The Doors. Which event could cause Jane knew it was hard work, but persevered with her idols in mind?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jane decided she wanted to practice to play the guitar like Hendrix. (B) Jane wanted to become a musician too.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jane decided she wanted to practice to play the guitar like Hendrix.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Jane's admiration for The Doors and their music. Hendrix was a famous guitarist who was also admired by The Doors, so it makes sense that Jane would want to emulate his style and work hard to achieve her goal. Becoming a musician is a broader goal that may not necessarily be tied to Jane's specific admiration for The Doors, so it is less likely to be the event that motivates her to persevere."}}
{"Q": "Henry was racing to get to work one morning. Which event could cause He handed Henry a ticket for speeding?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He got pulled over. (B) The police found him going under the speed limit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He got pulled over.\nExplanation: If Henry was racing to get to work, it is more likely that he was driving over the speed limit, which could result in him getting pulled over by the police and receiving a speeding ticket. Option B, where the police found him going under the speed limit, is less likely to result in a ticket for speeding."}}
{"Q": "Sam went for a ride in Shanghai with his family. Which event could cause The man accepted, then ripped the dollar in front of his eyes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam didnt change the currency of money. (B) He tried to pay the driver in silver coins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sam didn't change the currency of money.\nExplanation: It is common knowledge that the currency used in Shanghai is the Chinese yuan. If Sam did not change his currency to yuan and tried to pay with US dollars, the man may have been offended and ripped the dollar in front of his eyes as a sign of disrespect. On the other hand, option B seems less likely as silver coins are not commonly used as currency in Shanghai."}}
{"Q": "The gavel rang out across the room after the sentence was given. Which event could cause I could feel the sharp bristles of the rope tighten around my neck?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was a life sentence without parole. I don't know if I can take life in prison. (B) I was sentenced to five years for my crimes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was a life sentence without parole. \nExplanation: A life sentence without parole means that the person will spend the rest of their life in prison without the possibility of release. This is a much harsher sentence than a five-year sentence and could cause the person to feel the bristles of the rope tighten around their neck as they contemplate spending the rest of their life in prison."}}
{"Q": "The river was full people rafting down on inner tubes. Which event could cause The guy looked around and wondered how long he was asleep?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) one guy fell asleep in his raft. (B) The guy woke down on his raft.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The guy woke down on his raft.\nExplanation: If the guy fell asleep in his raft, he would still be on the river with other people rafting down. It wouldn't explain why he was wondering how long he was asleep for. However, if the guy woke up on his raft, it's possible that he had fallen asleep while rafting and drifted away from the group, causing him to wonder how long he had been asleep and how far he had drifted. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Paula goes on a dinner date. Which event could cause Paula waits around to get the waiters number?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Paula is more attracted to the waiter than her date. (B) She doesn't likes her date and not the waiter .", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Paula is more attracted to the waiter than her date.\n\nExplanation: If Paula is more attracted to the waiter than her date, she may wait around to get his number. This could be because she wants to pursue a relationship with him instead of her current date. On the other hand, if she doesn't like her date or the waiter, she is unlikely to wait around to get anyone's number. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Paul realized he was becoming less healthy in his old age. Which event could cause He was very happy to have adopted a healthier lifestyle?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He joined a library and spoke to a nutritionist. (B) He joined a gym and spoke to a nutrionist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He joined a gym and spoke to a nutritionist.\n\nExplanation: Joining a gym and speaking to a nutritionist are both actions that indicate a commitment to a healthier lifestyle. By doing so, Paul would have access to exercise equipment and professional advice on how to improve his diet, which could help him become healthier. Additionally, regular exercise and a balanced diet are known to have numerous health benefits, so it is plausible that adopting these habits could improve Paul's overall health. Joining a library, while beneficial for other reasons, would not necessarily have a direct impact on Paul's physical health."}}
{"Q": "Martin was a friendly guy. Which event could cause She dried her eyes, smiled, and waved back?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Martin waved to the sad girl wqlking by. (B) Martin met a crying girl. She gave Martin a candy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Martin waved to a sad girl walking by, it could have caused her to feel acknowledged and seen, which could have lifted her spirits and caused her to dry her eyes, smile, and wave back. Martin's friendly gesture could have had a positive impact on the girl's mood. On the other hand, meeting a crying girl and receiving candy from her may not necessarily lead to the girl drying her eyes, smiling, and waving back."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was happy to have her new phone. Which event could cause Kelly bought a new phone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She didn't like it after she brought it home. (B) She loved it once she brought it home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She loved it once she brought it home.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Kelly was happy to have her new phone, which implies that she is satisfied with her purchase. Therefore, it is more plausible that she loved the phone once she brought it home, rather than not liking it after bringing it home."}}
{"Q": "Mia sat at home in her living room watching sports. Which event could cause Mia cheered loudly and thought that she helped score that goal?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mia held her breath as her team was about to score, so that she wouldn't jinx it. (B) Suddenly the power went out during the biggest play!.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mia held her breath as her team was about to score, so that she wouldn't jinx it.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because it shows Mia's emotional investment in the game and her belief in superstitions. It is common for sports fans to have rituals or superstitions that they believe will bring good luck to their team. Mia's behavior of holding her breath shows that she is emotionally invested in the game and wants her team to win. On the other hand, the power going out during the biggest play is less likely to cause Mia to cheer loudly and think that she helped score the goal. It is more likely to cause frustration and disappointment."}}
{"Q": "Mary like to feed the pigeons on her roof. Which event could cause Mary went back downstairs and hoped for the pigeons return?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary climbed to the rooftop to scatter some seeds. (B) But tramping up there drew them closer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) But tramping up there drew them closer.\n\nExplanation: If Mary climbed to the rooftop to scatter some seeds, it is unlikely that she would go back downstairs and hope for the pigeons' return because she had just fed them. However, if tramping up to the rooftop drew the pigeons closer, Mary may have gone back downstairs to give them some space and wait for them to return on their own. This scenario is more plausible because it suggests that Mary's actions unintentionally caused the pigeons to become too close for comfort."}}
{"Q": "Sally drives everyday to work. Which event could cause Luckily she stopped in time, but almost hit the kitten?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sally hit the gas when a kitten crossed in front. (B) Sally's almost could not stop when she pressed her breaks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Sally hit the gas when a kitten crossed in front.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because it is common for drivers to accidentally hit the gas pedal instead of the brake pedal when they are surprised by something unexpected, such as a kitten crossing the road. In this case, Sally was lucky to have stopped in time, but it could have been a dangerous situation if she had not reacted quickly enough. On the other hand, option (B) suggests that Sally's brakes were not working properly, which is less likely to happen if she drives her car regularly and maintains it properly."}}
{"Q": "Herman was getting tired of his store-bought coffee. Which event could cause He kept improving, and in time was brewing great coffee?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Herman decided to grind his own coffee beans. (B) Herman decided to visit a coffee shop everyday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Herman decided to grind his own coffee beans.\nExplanation: Grinding your own coffee beans is a common way to improve the taste of your coffee. By grinding the beans yourself, you can control the coarseness of the grind and ensure that the coffee is fresh. This can lead to a significant improvement in the taste of the coffee, which could explain why Herman was able to brew great coffee after making this change. Visiting a coffee shop every day may expose Herman to different types of coffee, but it is unlikely to improve his own brewing skills."}}
{"Q": "Fred decided to walk home from school one day. Which event could cause Luckily, he ran into a classmate who invited him inside?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It started down pouring. (B) It was sunny out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) It started down pouring.\nExplanation: If it started down pouring, Fred would likely seek shelter and may not have made it home without getting soaked. Running into a classmate who invited him inside would be a fortunate coincidence. On the other hand, if it was sunny out, Fred would not have a pressing reason to seek shelter and may have continued on his way home without running into anyone."}}
{"Q": "Yesterday my iron broke. Which event could cause Thankfully I got a new one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I attempted to fix it myself. (B) I dont need an iron anymore to look good for work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I attempted to fix it myself.\nExplanation: If the iron broke and the person attempted to fix it themselves, it is possible that they were unsuccessful and had to purchase a new one. This scenario is more plausible than suddenly not needing an iron for work."}}
{"Q": "A bear wandered through the woods. Which event could cause Satisfied with the catch and the fish it returned home to sleep?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The bear was looking for shelter and headed to the mountains. (B) The bear caught some fish and ate it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the bear would return home to sleep after catching and eating some fish, as it would have satisfied its hunger and need for food. The option of the bear looking for shelter and heading to the mountains does not necessarily indicate that it would be satisfied enough to sleep."}}
{"Q": "Alice needed a new computer. Which event could cause Alice was upset to leave the store without a new computer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Alice could not find a well priced computer. (B) Alice searched around the computer store to find a broken computer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Alice could not find a well priced computer.\nExplanation: If Alice was unable to find a computer that fit her budget, she would be upset about leaving the store without a new computer. On the other hand, searching for a broken computer would not be a logical reason for Alice to be upset about leaving the store without a new computer."}}
{"Q": "Ana needed gas in her car. Which event could cause Ana filled her tank at the reservation?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ana decided to go to her local convenience store. (B) Gas was cheaper at the reservation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Gas was cheaper at the reservation.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ana would go to the reservation to fill up her tank if gas was cheaper there. It is unlikely that she would go to a convenience store specifically to fill up her tank unless she needed other items as well. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely reason for Ana to fill up at the reservation."}}
{"Q": "May came home and saw her flower vase broken. Which event could cause May didn't believe him but he swore it wasn't his fault?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) May accused her roommate of breaking the vase. (B) May blamed her boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. May accused her roommate of breaking the vase.\nExplanation: Since May found her flower vase broken at home, she might have assumed that someone in the house broke it. If her roommate was the only other person in the house at the time, May might have accused her roommate of breaking the vase. In this scenario, her roommate might have denied breaking the vase, and May might not have believed her. Therefore, it is more plausible that May accused her roommate of breaking the vase rather than blaming her boyfriend, who might not have been present at the time."}}
{"Q": "Sam was working in the garden. Which event could cause He got her a terrarium and has kept her as a pet ever since?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam found a cat in the garden. (B) Sam found a frog.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sam found a frog.\nExplanation: Finding a frog in the garden is a more plausible event that could lead to Sam getting a terrarium and keeping it as a pet. Frogs are commonly found in gardens and can be kept as pets in terrariums. On the other hand, finding a cat in the garden is less likely and it is not common to keep cats in terrariums."}}
{"Q": "Lyn spoke with a stutter. Which event could cause In a few months, it had vanished entirely?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lyn sought treatment and it helped. (B) Lyn decided to get acting lessons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lyn sought treatment and it helped.\nExplanation: Stuttering is a speech disorder that can be treated with therapy and other interventions. Seeking treatment from a speech therapist or other healthcare professional can help individuals overcome their stuttering. With consistent therapy and practice, it is possible for a stutter to improve or even disappear entirely. On the other hand, taking acting lessons may help with public speaking skills, but it is unlikely to have a significant impact on a stutter. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Dan and Stan were playing mini-golf against each other. Which event could cause Stan concentrated on his final stroke and got a hole in one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Can was in the lead. (B) Stan was not in the lead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Stan was not in the lead.\nExplanation: If Stan was not in the lead, he may have felt pressure to make a good shot in order to catch up to Dan or at least tie the game. This pressure could have caused him to concentrate more on his final stroke and ultimately result in a hole in one. On the other hand, if Stan was already in the lead, he may have felt less pressure and not put as much focus on his final stroke."}}
{"Q": "Derek has had it with dean. Which event could cause Dean did not talk to him again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Derek yelled at Dean. (B) Derek had a conversation with Dean.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Derek yelled at Dean.\nExplanation: Yelling at someone is a more aggressive and confrontational behavior that could cause the other person to feel hurt or offended. It is more likely to cause a rift in the relationship and make Dean not want to talk to Derek again. On the other hand, having a conversation with Dean could potentially resolve any issues or misunderstandings between them."}}
{"Q": "Bob had been grounded for receiving bad grades at school. Which event could cause Bob was able to return back to his room without his parents noticing?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob snuck out of his room. (B) Bob was getting yelled at when his parents got distracted, so he ran away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Bob snuck out of his room.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bob would sneak out of his room rather than running away while getting yelled at. Sneaking out of his room would allow him to avoid detection and return without his parents noticing. Running away while getting yelled at would only draw more attention to himself and make it more difficult to return unnoticed."}}
{"Q": "Tom decided to go for a hike. Which event could cause Tom was able to finish his hike?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom left early in the night so he would have plenty of darkness. (B) A park ranger stopped Tom and warned of a baby fawn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If a park ranger stopped Tom and warned him of a baby fawn, it is likely that Tom would have adjusted his route or taken precautions to avoid disturbing the fawn. This would have allowed him to complete his hike without any issues. On the other hand, leaving early in the night to have plenty of darkness could actually make it more difficult for Tom to navigate and complete his hike safely."}}
{"Q": "Joe went to the store to buy some dinner plates. Which event could cause Joe walked away and told no one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe knocked down and broke some of the plates. (B) He almost broke the plates he was going to buy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He almost broke the plates he was going to buy.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe would walk away and not tell anyone if he almost broke the plates he was going to buy, rather than if he actually knocked down and broke some of the plates. If he broke some of the plates, it is more likely that he would have informed a store employee and paid for the damages. However, if he almost broke the plates, he may have felt embarrassed or frustrated and simply walked away without telling anyone."}}
{"Q": "I put the black plastic rose in a vase with water. Which event could cause After a few weeks the flower died?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I replaced it with a real rose. (B) It turns out it was actually a red rose, but I didn't know for awhile.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is (B) because if the plastic rose was replaced with a real rose, it would not have died after a few weeks. However, if the plastic rose was actually a red rose and not meant to be submerged in water, it could have slowly deteriorated and died over time."}}
{"Q": "Bob and Dave decided to go camping on the weekend. Which event could cause Dave chuckled and told Bob he was right about the trip?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob showed Dave all the camping supplies he previously bought. (B) Bob told a good time that they would have Dave.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Bob showed Dave all the camping supplies he previously bought.\nExplanation: Dave chuckled and told Bob he was right about the trip because seeing all the camping supplies that Bob had bought would have reassured Dave that they were well-prepared for the trip and would have a good time. It would have also shown Dave that Bob had put effort into planning the trip, which would have made him feel more excited and confident about the adventure. On the other hand, Bob telling a good time they would have would not necessarily have elicited a chuckle from Dave, as it could have been seen as just a generic statement without any substance."}}
{"Q": "The puppy scratched at the door. Which event could cause The puppy looked very happy as it ran in the yard?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The puppy was very cold. (B) But nobody threatens the puppy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) But nobody threatens the puppy.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the puppy scratched at the door because it wanted to go outside and play in the yard, rather than because it was cold. Therefore, option (A) can be ruled out. On the other hand, if nobody threatens the puppy, it is likely to feel safe and happy, which could explain why it looked very happy as it ran in the yard. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It was time for Mary to get a flu shot. Which event could cause Mary got flu the following week?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary died. (B) She decided to go shopping instead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She decided to go shopping instead.\nExplanation: Getting a flu shot does not guarantee that a person will not get the flu, as the vaccine may not be effective against all strains of the virus. However, going shopping instead of getting the flu shot does not directly cause Mary to get the flu the following week. It is possible that she could have contracted the virus from someone else or from a contaminated surface."}}
{"Q": "Eric walked through the city park on his way to a bar. Which event could cause Eric ran off and hoped that he was not being chased?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eric saw a squirrel. (B) A man tried to rob Eric.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Eric would run off and hope he was not being chased if a man tried to rob him. Seeing a squirrel would not typically cause someone to run off in fear. However, being threatened by a potential robber could cause Eric to feel unsafe and flee the area."}}
{"Q": "It wouldn't be untrue to say that Jim was a bit obsessive. Which event could cause The next morning, he saw that his little figurine had been moved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim put his painting in a special place that he liked. (B) Jim kept everything in its place.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jim kept everything in its place.\nExplanation: Since Jim was described as obsessive, it is more plausible that he would be very particular about keeping everything in its place. Therefore, the fact that his little figurine had been moved would be more likely to cause him concern or distress than if he had simply put his painting in a special place that he liked."}}
{"Q": "Bill was recently invited to the movies with a coworker. Which event could cause Bill was mortified of horror movies, as he always has nightmares?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bill was happy to be invited by his co-worker. (B) Bill was not too happy to be not invited by his co-worker.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Bill was happy to be invited by his co-worker.\nExplanation: Since Bill was invited to the movies by his co-worker, it is more plausible that he would be happy about the invitation rather than unhappy about not being invited. The fact that Bill is mortified of horror movies and has nightmares suggests that he may not be looking forward to watching a horror movie, but this does not necessarily mean he is unhappy about being invited."}}
{"Q": "The girls went to a bar. Which event could cause They got into the plane?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They went home and went to bed. (B) The girls met a millionaire who invited him on his plane.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The girls met a millionaire who invited them on his plane.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible as it suggests that the girls met someone who offered them a ride on his private plane. It is unlikely that they would go from being at a bar to suddenly getting on a plane without any explanation or context. Meeting someone who is wealthy and generous enough to offer them a ride on his plane is a more believable scenario."}}
{"Q": "Maddie was feeling sick. Which event could cause On a tray, he had her medicine, and a surprise bowl of ice cream?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Maddie went to the doctor to be treated for her injury. (B) Maddie's boyfriend decided to take care of her while she was sick.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Maddie's boyfriend decided to take care of her while she was sick.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Maddie's boyfriend decided to take care of her while she was sick and brought her medicine and a surprise bowl of ice cream to make her feel better. Going to the doctor for an injury would not necessarily result in medicine and ice cream, and it is not mentioned that Maddie has an injury."}}
{"Q": "Yul needed to wrap a gift. Which event could cause Yul then stuck a bow on top of the box?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Yul drew on the box to decorate it, instead. (B) He put the gift in a bag.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He put the gift in a bag.\nExplanation: If Yul put the gift in a bag, he may not have had the opportunity to stick a bow on top of the box. It is more likely that he would have simply tied a ribbon or bow around the bag instead. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kara found a ring on the ground. Which event could cause Kara was disappointed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kara incompleted it was a fake ring. (B) However, it wasn't a real diamond.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) However, it wasn't a real diamond.\nExplanation: Kara may have been disappointed if she had initially thought that the ring was a real diamond, but upon closer inspection, she realized that it was not. This could have been a letdown for her, especially if she had high hopes for the ring's value or sentimental significance. On the other hand, if Kara had suspected from the beginning that the ring was fake, she may not have been disappointed to find out that it was not a real diamond. Therefore, option (B) seems like a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This morning I was on the couch when I felt my nose start to drip. Which event could cause After a few moments, the bleeding finally stopped?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I quickly realized it was blood. (B) I noticed I had a large cut on my nose.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I noticed I had a large cut on my nose.\nExplanation: If the nose was bleeding, it is more likely that there was a cut or injury to the nose that caused the bleeding to occur. Realizing it was blood would not necessarily stop the bleeding, but noticing the cut and applying pressure or taking other measures to stop the bleeding would be more effective."}}
{"Q": "Lou liked to feed stray animals. Which event could cause The cat has been Lou's best companion since?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lou found found a tiger while feeding stray animals. (B) Lou left cat food outside his back porch every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lou left cat food outside his back porch every day.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lou's best companion would be a cat that he fed regularly rather than a tiger that he found while feeding stray animals. Leaving cat food outside his back porch every day would attract stray cats, and one of them may have become attached to Lou and become his companion."}}
{"Q": "Sam had really bad social anxiety. Which event could cause Sam's social anxiety decreased after exposing herself to more people?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam had to go out and meet people to get rid of it. (B) Sam made an effort at trying to be alone more often.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sam had to go out and meet people to get rid of it.\n\nExplanation: Exposure therapy is a common treatment for social anxiety disorder, where the individual is gradually exposed to anxiety-provoking situations until they become desensitized to them. In this case, Sam's social anxiety would likely decrease if she exposed herself to more people and social situations, rather than avoiding them by being alone more often (option B). Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sadie was excited. Which event could cause She knew there were millions of other publishing agencies to try?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She finished writing a book and sent it to one publisher. (B) Sadie was thrilled to get a top publishing agency to sign her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She finished writing a book and sent it to one publisher.\nExplanation: If Sadie finished writing a book and sent it to one publisher, she would be excited about the possibility of getting published. However, she would also be aware that there are many other publishing agencies to try if the first one doesn't work out. Therefore, it is more plausible that this event would cause her excitement and awareness of the competitive publishing industry. On the other hand, if Sadie already got a top publishing agency to sign her, she would be more relieved and grateful than excited about the competition."}}
{"Q": "I just got my braces removed. Which event could cause Alas, I got a cavity soon after for eating too much gum?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I decided not to chew gum ever again. (B) I was thrilled to eat forbidden foods again.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I was thrilled to eat forbidden foods again.\nExplanation: After getting braces removed, many people are excited to eat the foods they couldn't eat while wearing braces. This excitement may lead to overindulgence in sugary or sticky foods, which can increase the risk of developing cavities. Chewing gum excessively can also contribute to the development of cavities, especially if it contains sugar. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person got a cavity from eating too much gum and other forbidden foods rather than deciding to never chew gum again."}}
{"Q": "Tay was having a yard sale. Which event could cause After the sale she had made more than enough cash?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tay gave most of her things away. (B) Tay wanted to make enough money to buy a bike.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tay wanted to make enough money to buy a bike.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tay's goal for having a yard sale was to make money, rather than giving most of her things away. Therefore, if her goal was to make enough money to buy a bike, it is likely that she was successful in achieving that goal and made more than enough cash."}}
{"Q": "I had my college prom in The Field Museum Which event could cause He asked me to marry him, I said No?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My date was a sweet boy. (B) My date seemed to be loathing the dance more than me.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) My date was a sweet boy.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for saying no to a marriage proposal would be due to personal feelings towards the proposer rather than the event location or the behavior of the date. Therefore, it is possible that the protagonist's date was a sweet boy, but she did not have romantic feelings for him and therefore declined the proposal."}}
{"Q": "Sahara was digging through the car. Which event could cause She was so mad at them for opening the game that she took it back?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She found the package holding the game she bought her son for his birthday. (B) She found her game had been closed tight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She found the package holding the game she bought her son for his birthday.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it provides a clear reason for Sahara's anger and action of taking the game back. If she had found her game closed tight, it wouldn't necessarily explain why she would take it back from them. However, if she found the package holding the game she bought for her son, it would make sense that she would be upset that they opened it without her permission and took away the surprise for her son's birthday."}}
{"Q": "Franklin was an only child and had never had a roommate before. Which event could cause They discovered they had a lot in common, and Franklin was reassured?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Franklin talked to his roommate. (B) He had to get a nanny for college.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Franklin talked to his roommate.\nExplanation: When Franklin talks to his roommate, he may discover that they have similar interests, hobbies, or backgrounds. This can help him feel more comfortable and reassured that he can get along with his roommate. On the other hand, getting a nanny for college (option B) is not a plausible event and does not relate to the situation of having a roommate."}}
{"Q": "It was Judy's birthday. Which event could cause Candy came out and fell everywhere?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Judy has a pinata party. (B) A pinata full of candy was hitting Judy hanging in a tree.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Judy has a pinata party.\nExplanation: A pinata party is a common birthday celebration where a pinata filled with candy is hung up and children take turns hitting it with a stick until it breaks open and spills the candy inside. Therefore, it is more plausible that Candy came out and fell everywhere because Judy had a pinata party. Option B is less likely as it suggests that someone was hitting Judy with a pinata filled with candy, which is not a typical or appropriate birthday activity."}}
{"Q": "It was starting to get cold outside. Which event could cause The Smith family was able to stay warm throughout the entire winter?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Smith family stored lots of canned food. (B) Dad, went out and started chopping wood for kindle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Dad, went out and started chopping wood for kindle.\nExplanation: Chopping wood for kindle is a common way to heat a home during the winter. By doing this, the Smith family would have a steady supply of firewood to keep their fireplace or wood stove going throughout the winter, which would help them stay warm. Storing canned food would not necessarily help them stay warm, but it would ensure they had enough food to eat during the winter months."}}
{"Q": "A third base coach gave the wrong sign to a player on first. Which event could cause That was the third out and the inning was over?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The player rounded second as the left fielder threw the ball to the first baseman. (B) The player tried to steal second and was tagged out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: If the player tried to steal second and was tagged out, it would result in the third out and end the inning. However, if the player rounded second as the left fielder threw the ball to the first baseman, it would not necessarily result in the third out and end the inning. The player could still potentially make it back to first safely or even advance to third or home. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Eli had been thinking about planting a garden. Which event could cause He realized that the work was worth it and was quite pleased?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eli worked all day in the cold sun planting flowers. (B) Over the summer Eli came to realize how much work keeping up on a garden was.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Eli worked all day in the cold sun planting flowers.\nExplanation: This event directly involves Eli putting in the effort to plant the garden, which would give him a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. It shows that he is willing to put in the work and that he values the end result enough to endure the physical labor. On the other hand, option B suggests that Eli may have become discouraged by the amount of work required, which would not lead to a feeling of satisfaction."}}
{"Q": "Alex was home alone on a Friday night. Which event could cause Three friends were there to visit him, and they had a wonderful night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alex was sad to spend the whole evening alone. (B) Alex,posted on facebook that he was lonely at home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Alex posted on Facebook that he was lonely at home.\nExplanation: If Alex posted on Facebook that he was lonely at home, his friends could have seen the post and decided to visit him. This is a more plausible explanation than Alex being sad to spend the whole evening alone, as it is possible that his friends were able to cheer him up and make the night wonderful."}}
{"Q": "Anna and her friends needed something to do. Which event could cause They still laughed and had fun?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They went to the park, but it was raining. (B) Her friends didn't want to go out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: They went to the park, but it was raining.\nExplanation: Even though the original plan of going to the park was ruined by the rain, Anna and her friends could have found other activities to do together, such as playing board games or watching movies indoors. They could have also embraced the rain and played in the puddles or had a picnic under a shelter. Therefore, it is more plausible that they still laughed and had fun despite the rain."}}
{"Q": "Julie had a coworker named Barry who loved to make trouble for others. Which event could cause Julie gave Barry a hug and thanked him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Barry one day helped Julie out during a crisis situation. (B) Barry apologized for making fun of her hair.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Julie would give Barry a hug and thank him if he helped her out during a crisis situation, as this would show that he is capable of being a supportive coworker and not just someone who causes trouble. Apologizing for making fun of her hair may not be enough to warrant such a positive reaction from Julie."}}
{"Q": "I order a dinner meal by my local restaurant. Which event could cause Since I didn't have the money, the restaurant gave me a fine?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When the check arrived, I realized I did not have the money to pay for my meal. (B) I brought money in my wallet from home, and ate everything that was served.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the customer realizes they don't have the money to pay for their meal when the check arrives, it is more likely that the restaurant would ask them to find a way to pay or offer to hold onto their ID or other collateral until they can pay. It is unlikely that the restaurant would give them a fine in this situation. However, if the customer eats everything that is served and then claims they don't have the money to pay, the restaurant may feel that they have been taken advantage of and could potentially give them a fine."}}
{"Q": "We celebrated Chinese New Year on February 7th. Which event could cause We rang in the new year by watching a youtube video of fireworks?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We wanted to see mistletoe. (B) It was a very cold day so we opted to stay home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) Fireworks are a traditional part of Chinese New Year celebrations.\nExplanation: Chinese New Year is typically celebrated with fireworks, so it is plausible that the family chose to watch a video of fireworks to mark the occasion. Option A, mistletoe, is not related to Chinese New Year, and option B, cold weather, would not necessarily prevent someone from going out to celebrate the holiday."}}
{"Q": "Peter had bought his dad a watch for Christmas. Which event could cause But then his dad smiled and Peter knew he loved the gift?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was a long lost family member. (B) When he opened the gift, he showed no emotion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) When he opened the gift, he showed no emotion.\n\nExplanation: If Peter's dad showed no emotion when he opened the gift, it could have made Peter unsure if his dad liked the gift or not. However, when his dad smiled later, it indicates that he was happy with the gift and appreciated it. This is a more plausible event as it shows a clear change in his dad's reaction towards the gift. On the other hand, a long lost family member appearing would not necessarily have a direct impact on Peter's dad's reaction to the gift."}}
{"Q": "Joe and Rafael wanted to see who can cook better wings. Which event could cause The family agreed that Joe's wings were better?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe and Rafael had a dance-off in the backyard. (B) Joe and Rafael had a cook off later that week.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Joe and Rafael had a cook off later that week.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the family would agree on who cooked better wings after a cook off between Joe and Rafael, rather than a dance-off in the backyard. A cook off would allow the family to taste and compare the wings directly, while a dance-off would not be related to cooking skills."}}
{"Q": "A man went to a katare school to take lessons. Which event could cause The sensei blocked the attack and punched the foolish man?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The sensei fought the man. (B) The man fought the sen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The man fought the sensei.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man initiated the attack on the sensei, which led to the sensei blocking the attack and retaliating with a punch. It is unlikely that the sensei would randomly fight the man without any provocation. Additionally, the use of the word \"foolish\" suggests that the man did something to provoke the sensei's reaction."}}
{"Q": "I play violin and take a lot of orchestra auditions. Which event could cause I am now a member of the symphony and love my job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I decided to try to join the new symphony. I auditioned and they didn't take me. (B) I practice many hours a week.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I practice many hours a week.\nExplanation: It is more likely that consistent and dedicated practice would lead to improvement in playing ability, which in turn would increase the chances of success in orchestra auditions. Joining a symphony and loving the job would require a high level of skill and dedication, which can only be achieved through consistent practice. On the other hand, being rejected from an audition may be discouraging, but it does not necessarily lead to becoming a member of a symphony and loving the job."}}
{"Q": "Tom needed one more quarter for bus fare. Which event could cause He felt lucky as he headed to the bus stop?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom found a quarter on the ground. (B) An old lady gave Tom a quarter of a sandwich.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom found a quarter on the ground.\nExplanation: Finding a quarter on the ground is a plausible event that could cause Tom to feel lucky. It is a common occurrence and could easily happen, especially if Tom was keeping an eye out for loose change. On the other hand, an old lady giving Tom a quarter of a sandwich is less likely to happen and may not necessarily make Tom feel lucky."}}
{"Q": "Pablo likes to eat worms. Which event could cause Pablo enjoys worms and views them as a delicacy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was born in Thailand. (B) Pablo has been eating worms for two days.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Pablo has developed a taste for worms after eating them for two days, rather than his birthplace determining his food preferences. It is possible that he tried worms out of curiosity or necessity and found that he enjoyed the taste, leading him to view them as a delicacy. However, it is important to note that eating worms can be dangerous and is not recommended."}}
{"Q": "Halloween was a couple weeks ago. Which event could cause I took all the leftover candy to work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My work had a lot of candy. (B) All of the candy is gone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My work had a lot of candy.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the reason for taking leftover candy to work is because there was a surplus of candy at work, rather than all the candy being gone. If all the candy was gone, there would be no leftover candy to take to work."}}
{"Q": "Randy wanted to be in a band. Which event could cause Randy got to join the band as a singer?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Randy auditioned all around town for an acting job. (B) Randy went to a try out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Randy went to a try out.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Randy would join a band as a singer by attending a try out specifically for singers rather than auditioning for acting jobs around town. Attending a try out would give Randy the opportunity to showcase his singing skills and potentially impress the band members."}}
{"Q": "I never really enjoy Thanksgiving much due to not having much family. Which event could cause When we finished, we said our goodbyes and went home to sleep?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) After I got married my wife and I celebrated with my family. (B) I went to a friend's house this year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I went to a friend's house this year.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the person found a solution to their problem of not having much family to celebrate Thanksgiving with. Going to a friend's house is a common alternative for people who don't have family nearby or who don't enjoy spending time with their family. On the other hand, getting married and celebrating with one's family may not be a feasible solution for everyone, as not everyone has a partner or a good relationship with their family."}}
{"Q": "I woke up at 7am. Which event could cause He had really awful breath?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I leaned over in bed and kissed my husband. (B) The mailman man ignored me for a package delivery.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I leaned over in bed and kissed my husband.\nExplanation: When we sleep, our mouth produces less saliva, which can lead to dry mouth and bad breath. If the person in question woke up and immediately leaned over to kiss their husband, they may have noticed their bad breath. On the other hand, the mailman ignoring them for a package delivery has no direct correlation with bad breath."}}
{"Q": "Jan and Kim were both using the Montessori education model. Which event could cause Jan brought the books back?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jan borrowed some of the books from Kim. (B) Kim borrowed some books from Jan.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jan borrowed some of the books from Kim.\n\nExplanation: If Jan borrowed some of the books from Kim, it would make sense for her to bring them back once she was finished using them. This is a common practice in Montessori education, where students are encouraged to borrow materials and return them when they are done. On the other hand, if Kim borrowed some books from Jan, it would not necessarily lead to Jan bringing the books back, as Kim may still be using them. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sue had a really bad fever. Which event could cause She felt better the next day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sue decided to stay home and pretend to be sick. (B) Sue took the day off, took some aspirin and napped all day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Taking the day off, resting, and taking medication (aspirin) are common remedies for a fever. Napping all day can also help the body recover and fight off the illness. Therefore, it is more plausible that Sue felt better the next day because she took care of herself and allowed her body to rest and recover. Option A, pretending to be sick, would not have any effect on her physical condition and would not explain why she felt better the next day."}}
{"Q": "Laura had a passion for art. Which event could cause Laura was pleased to show people her art?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Laura worked hard learning to paint. (B) People saw Laura's art project and liked them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If people saw Laura's art project and liked them, it would give her a sense of validation and encouragement to continue pursuing her passion for art. It would also give her an opportunity to share her work with others and receive feedback, which could be a rewarding experience for her. While working hard to learn to paint is important, it may not necessarily lead to the same level of satisfaction as having others appreciate and enjoy her artwork."}}
{"Q": "James was walking through the snow. Which event could cause He quickly ran home to change into new clothing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) James' hair got wet. (B) He slipped and fell in the mud.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. James' hair got wet.\nExplanation: If James' hair got wet while walking through the snow, it could cause him to quickly run home to change into new clothing. Wet hair can make a person feel cold and uncomfortable, and if James was planning on being outside for a while, he may have wanted to change into dry clothes to avoid getting sick. On the other hand, slipping and falling in the mud may also cause James to want to change his clothes, but it is less likely to happen while walking through the snow."}}
{"Q": "One day, Jim and Tom went to the beach. Which event could cause Jim and Tom never had another hot dog after that day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They got food poisoning from some bad hamburgers. (B) The hot dogs Jim bought made them sick.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The hot dogs Jim bought made them sick.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the hot dogs they ate made them sick rather than the bad hamburgers they didn't mention buying or eating. Additionally, if they got food poisoning from the hamburgers, it is unlikely that they would blame it on the hot dogs and never eat them again. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "Monique was finishing a new novel. Which event could cause She took the copy and slapped Gary hard over the head with it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gary snuck up behind her and scared her because she was deeply involved in reading her novel. (B) She was testing Gary about it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Monique was startled by Gary sneaking up behind her while she was deeply involved in reading her novel, causing her to react impulsively and hit him with the book. Testing Gary about the novel does not seem like a reasonable cause for such a violent reaction."}}
{"Q": "My hobby is taking selfies in front of poets' graves. Which event could cause I took several selfies by this poet's grave?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My favorite was Maya Angelou. (B) I went to a grave and found a sports figures marker.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) My favorite was Maya Angelou.\nExplanation: Since the person's hobby is taking selfies in front of poets' graves, it is more plausible that they would take several selfies by their favorite poet's grave. It is unlikely that they would take several selfies by a sports figure's marker as it does not align with their hobby."}}
{"Q": "Karen wanted to have a child of her own. Which event could cause She has never been happier in her life?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Karen eventually gave birth to a baby rabbit. (B) Karen asked her boyfriend if he would like one too and he said yes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Karen eventually gave birth to a human baby.\nExplanation: It is biologically impossible for a human to give birth to a baby rabbit, making option A implausible. Option B may bring Karen happiness, but it does not necessarily guarantee that she will be the happiest she has ever been in her life. On the other hand, giving birth to a human baby is a significant life event that many people consider to be one of the happiest moments in their lives. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom had too many headphones. Which event could cause He never had a problem untangling headphones again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) it took him no time to untangle them. (B) Tom chose to go with wireless equipment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom chose to go with wireless equipment.\nExplanation: If Tom chose to switch to wireless headphones, he would no longer have to deal with tangled cords, as there would be no cords to tangle. This would solve his problem of constantly having to untangle his headphones. Therefore, this event is more plausible than option A, which may not necessarily solve the problem of tangled cords."}}
{"Q": "I was bored in my room one day. Which event could cause I was still bored, so I stopped?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I decided to play some video games. (B) So I decided I would try juggling.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I decided to play some video games.\nExplanation: Playing video games is a more common and easily accessible activity that can provide entertainment and alleviate boredom. Juggling requires a certain skill set and equipment, which may not be readily available to everyone. Therefore, it is more plausible that playing video games would be the event that could cause someone to stop being bored in their room."}}
{"Q": "Today we went on a plane ride. Which event could cause I vowed to never get on a plane again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plane did not have a smooth flight. (B) And there was a fight over the game.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The plane did not have a smooth flight.\nExplanation: A bumpy or turbulent flight can be a scary experience for some people, especially if they are not used to flying. It can cause anxiety, fear, and even panic attacks. This could lead someone to vow to never get on a plane again. On the other hand, a fight over a game, while unpleasant, is unlikely to be a traumatic enough experience to make someone swear off flying altogether."}}
{"Q": "I opened up my sleeping bag I hadn't used in ten years. Which event could cause Thankfully though, I knew someone who could fix it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a mouse in my sleeping bag. (B) and there were a lot of moth holes in the material.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the sleeping bag would have moth holes after ten years of storage than a mouse being inside. Moths are known to damage fabrics and can easily get into storage areas. Additionally, the fact that the person knew someone who could fix it suggests that it was a repairable issue, rather than a mouse infestation."}}
{"Q": "Jill always got bad grades in math. Which event could cause To her surprise, she got every question right?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jill studied really hard. (B) Jill studied really hard for her upcoming English test.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jill studied really hard.\nExplanation: If Jill studied really hard for her math test, it is plausible that she would do well and get every question right. However, studying hard for an English test would not necessarily improve her math skills. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Early Saturday morning as I sat reading my Bible a butterfly flew by. Which event could cause I watched her until she faded away and then resumed my study?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She moved as though she were dancing through the air. (B) SATURDAY MORNING AS I WOKE UP EARLY AND READING MY BIBLE ALWAYS.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The event that could cause the person to watch the butterfly until it faded away and then resume their study is that the butterfly moved as though she were dancing through the air. This suggests that the person was captivated by the butterfly's graceful movements and was drawn to watch it until it was out of sight. The second choice, about waking up early and reading the Bible, does not provide a clear reason for why the person would stop reading to watch the butterfly."}}
{"Q": "Lucy had no clean clothes. Which event could cause Lucy fell in love with the feeling of a sweater, warm from the dryer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy decided to do her laundry. (B) Lucy threw away her sweater.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy decided to do her laundry.\nExplanation: If Lucy had no clean clothes, it is likely that she would need to do her laundry. As a result, she would have access to a warm sweater straight from the dryer, which could lead her to fall in love with the feeling. On the other hand, if Lucy threw away her sweater, she would not have access to it anymore, and it would not be a plausible event that could cause her to fall in love with the feeling of a warm sweater."}}
{"Q": "Liz went to order her burger. Which event could cause She threw her burger away?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Liz realized it was not a burger. (B) Liz was not really hungry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Liz realized it was not a burger.\nExplanation: If Liz realized that the burger she ordered was not actually a burger, she may have thrown it away because she did not want to eat something she did not order or did not like. On the other hand, if Liz was not really hungry, she may have simply saved the burger for later or given it to someone else. Therefore, option A is a more plausible reason for Liz throwing her burger away."}}
{"Q": "Candice loves tacos. Which event could cause Candice stuck to her original taco recipe?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Candice tried a new taco recipe, but it tasted terrible. (B) Candice decided to buy some.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Candice tried a new taco recipe, but it tasted terrible.\nExplanation: If Candice tried a new taco recipe and it didn't taste good, she may be hesitant to try new recipes in the future and stick to her original recipe that she knows she enjoys. On the other hand, if she decided to buy tacos instead of making them, it wouldn't necessarily affect her original recipe."}}
{"Q": "Alex is a selfish man. Which event could cause Now, Alex is dating the girl and is very generous and sweet?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He changed his ways to find a boyfriend. (B) Alex met a girl that he really liked.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Alex met a girl that he really liked.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alex's change in behavior is due to meeting someone he genuinely cares about and wants to impress. Love and attraction can often inspire people to be more generous and kind. On the other hand, it is less likely that Alex changed his ways just to find a boyfriend, as this implies that he was previously interested in men and was only pretending to be selfish to attract them."}}
{"Q": "Last week, my mother was frustrated because it seemed nothing worked. Which event could cause For half an hour she cried, and it suddenly powered on like magic?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her computer was just not working. (B) the power would not turn off in the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her computer was just not working.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that her frustration and tears were caused by her computer not working, as this is a common source of frustration for many people. Additionally, it is not likely that the power being unable to turn off in the house would cause her to cry for half an hour, as this is a relatively minor inconvenience. The sudden powering on of her computer could be explained by a temporary glitch or issue that resolved itself, which is not uncommon in technology."}}
{"Q": "Evie was at a fair. Which event could cause They were so pretty that she decided to buy one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Evie saw a captivating hat at a booth. (B) People with lots of hats saw Evie.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Evie saw a captivating hat at a booth.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Evie's decision to buy something. If Evie saw a captivating hat at a booth, it would make sense for her to want to buy it because it caught her attention and she found it attractive. On the other hand, people with lots of hats seeing Evie does not necessarily have any connection to Evie's decision to buy something."}}
{"Q": "Lucy had a test tomorrow at school and she barely studied. Which event could cause Lucy aced the test?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy was super smart and always paid attention in class. (B) Lucy decided to study next time for the final test.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy was super smart and always paid attention in class.\nExplanation: While it is possible for Lucy to do well on the test without studying, it is more likely that her previous academic performance and attentiveness in class would contribute to her success. Studying for the final test, as stated in option B, would not have any impact on her performance on the upcoming test. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Peter decided to go for a walk. Which event could cause He headed home to change his clothes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Peter got wet in the dryness. (B) Halfway through his walk, it started pouring.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Halfway through his walk, it started pouring.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if it started pouring halfway through his walk, Peter would likely get wet and want to change his clothes before continuing his walk or heading back home. On the other hand, if he got wet in the dryness, it would not make sense for him to head home to change his clothes as there would be no reason to do so."}}
{"Q": "Marie decided to be in a school play. Which event could cause Marie was proud at the end when she got a standing ovation?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jennifer practiced her lines and emotions. (B) Marie read the script many times to remember every line.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Marie read the script many times to remember every line.\nExplanation: If Marie read the script many times to remember every line, it shows that she put in effort and dedication to her role in the play. This would increase the likelihood of her performing well and receiving a standing ovation at the end, which would make her proud. While Jennifer practicing her lines and emotions is also important, it does not necessarily guarantee a standing ovation or Marie's pride in the end result."}}
{"Q": "Lisa noticed there was a new girl at school. Which event could cause Lisa was glad to help?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lisa looked like she was lost. (B) Lisa invited the new girl to sit down with her and eat lunch.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Lisa invited the new girl to sit down with her and eat lunch.\n\nExplanation: This event shows that Lisa is friendly and welcoming towards the new girl. By inviting her to sit down and eat lunch together, Lisa is making an effort to include the new girl and help her feel more comfortable in her new environment. It is a plausible answer because it demonstrates a positive and proactive attitude towards making new friends. Option A is also a possibility, but it does not necessarily indicate that Lisa was glad to help. It could simply be a neutral observation."}}
{"Q": "Sam was mowing his front lawn. Which event could cause He placed them back into the nest in the tree?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam crushed bird eggs on his front lawn. (B) Sam spotted three baby birds on the ground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sam spotted three baby birds on the ground.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because if Sam saw baby birds on the ground, it is likely that they fell out of their nest. Placing them back into the nest in the tree would be the appropriate action to take to ensure their safety and well-being. On the other hand, if Sam crushed bird eggs on his front lawn, it would not make sense for him to place them back into a nest as they would be destroyed."}}
{"Q": "Alicia wanted to go to Miami for her party. Which event could cause The girls were mad because it was supposed to be a girls trip?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Alicia invited a boy to go along. (B) But her little sister wouldn't let her go alone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Alicia invited a boy to go along.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because if Alicia's little sister wouldn't let her go alone, she could have still gone with her girlfriends and her sister could have accompanied them. However, if Alicia invited a boy to go along, it would no longer be a girls trip and her friends would understandably be upset about it."}}
{"Q": "Matt and his girlfriend went to Yosemite last May. Which event could cause They had a wonderful trip and are excited to return?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather was beautiful in Yosemite. (B) matt had a caught the stomach flu.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The weather was beautiful in Yosemite.\nExplanation: Good weather can greatly enhance a trip and make it more enjoyable. If Matt and his girlfriend had beautiful weather during their trip to Yosemite, it is likely that they had a wonderful time and would be excited to return. On the other hand, if Matt had caught the stomach flu, it would have likely put a damper on their trip and made them less likely to want to return. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lee begged her parents to let her stay up late. Which event could cause But by eleven o'clock, she had fallen fast asleep?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She wanted to wake up to swim. (B) Lee's parents said she could stay up till midnight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lee's parents said she could stay up till midnight.\n\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that Lee was given permission to stay up late, but she still fell asleep before the agreed-upon time. It is common for children to get excited about staying up late, but then tire out quickly and fall asleep earlier than expected. Option (A) does not provide a clear reason for why Lee would fall asleep, as wanting to wake up to swim would not necessarily cause her to be too tired to stay up late."}}
{"Q": "Jeff learned how to play guitar at a very young age. Which event could cause They took the band on tour and became rockstars?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He clumsied everyday and became part of a band. (B) Jeff's parents liked listening to his band play.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He clumsied everyday and became part of a band.\nExplanation: If Jeff learned how to play guitar at a young age and continued to practice and improve his skills, it is plausible that he could join or form a band and eventually go on tour and become successful. However, the fact that Jeff's parents liked listening to his band play (option B) does not necessarily lead to the band becoming rockstars. It is more likely that the band's talent and hard work would be the determining factors in their success."}}
{"Q": "A scientist discovers that there is a disease beginning to spread. Which event could cause They save the world?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They ignore the authorities. (B) The scientist creates a vaccine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The scientist creates a vaccine.\nExplanation: Creating a vaccine is a plausible solution to save the world from a spreading disease. Vaccines have been proven to be effective in preventing the spread of diseases and have been instrumental in eradicating many deadly diseases in the past. Ignoring the authorities would not be a responsible or effective solution to the problem. Therefore, creating a vaccine would be the most plausible answer to save the world from the spreading disease."}}
{"Q": "Matthew wanted to got trick or treating with his friend Micah. Which event could cause Jack and Matthew collected lots of candy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Micah had to stay at home sick. (B) Micah had a huge bag to collect candy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Micah had a huge bag to collect candy.\nExplanation: If Micah had a huge bag to collect candy, it is likely that he and Matthew would have collected a lot of candy. On the other hand, if Micah had to stay at home sick, Matthew would have gone trick or treating alone and collected less candy. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jon got a job in East Texas. Which event could cause He decided to quit the job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jon didn't like his mom. (B) It was a hour away from his house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It was an hour away from his house.\nExplanation: The distance between Jon's house and his workplace could be a significant factor in his decision to quit the job. If the commute is too long, it could affect his work-life balance, causing him to feel exhausted and stressed. Additionally, the cost of transportation and the time spent on the road could also be a factor. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jon would quit his job because of the distance rather than not liking his mom, which is unrelated to his work situation."}}
{"Q": "A farmer built a fence to keep in his horses. Which event could cause The farmer cursed and realized his fence was too short?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The farmers horses all escape the fence. (B) No horses can escape the fence.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The farmers horses all escape the fence.\nExplanation: If the farmer's horses all escape the fence, it would indicate that the fence was not high enough or strong enough to contain them. This would cause the farmer to curse and realize that his fence was too short. On the other hand, if no horses can escape the fence, the farmer would not have any reason to curse or realize that the fence was too short."}}
{"Q": "Nancy is in her forties and decided to go get her college degree. Which event could cause Nancy was surprised by how much things have change in schools?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At her new university, all courses required online participation. (B) Nancy is much younger than most students in her classes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because technology has advanced significantly in recent years, and many universities have shifted towards online learning. It is not uncommon for courses to require online participation, and Nancy may not have expected this change if she has been out of school for a while. On the other hand, it is not unusual for non-traditional students like Nancy to be older than their classmates, so option B may not be as surprising to her."}}
{"Q": "Mike had a lemon tree in his backyard. Which event could cause He soon realized that he had forgotten to put any sugar in it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike made some lemonade with added sugar and took a big drink. (B) Mike made some lemonade and took a big drink.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Mike made some lemonade and took a big drink.\n\nExplanation: If Mike made lemonade without adding sugar, he would realize his mistake only after taking a sip. Option (A) suggests that Mike added sugar to his lemonade, which contradicts the premise that he forgot to add sugar. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I took my sons to their first concert. Which event could cause My sons decided they would rather go out and sit on the lawn?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I bought them seats in the front row. (B) My sons fell asleep.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I bought them seats in the front row.\nExplanation: It is possible that the front row seats were too close to the stage and the sound was too loud for their liking. They may have also had difficulty seeing the stage or performers due to the angle of the seats. Sitting on the lawn would provide a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for them. On the other hand, it is unlikely that they would fall asleep during their first concert, especially if they were excited to attend."}}
{"Q": "Jim wants to see an action movie but Jen wants to see a romantic one. Which event could cause Jen was so happy that she went to see Jim's movie the next night?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim agreed to see the romantic movie with Jen. (B) Jen agreed to see the romantic movie with Jim.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jim agreed to see the romantic movie with Jen.\n\nExplanation: If Jim agrees to see the romantic movie with Jen, it shows that he is willing to compromise and consider Jen's preferences. This gesture could make Jen feel happy and appreciated, leading her to reciprocate by agreeing to see Jim's preferred action movie the next night. On the other hand, if Jen agrees to see the romantic movie with Jim, it does not necessarily mean that she would be happy about it or willing to see Jim's movie the next night."}}
{"Q": "Tito went surfing one morning in Hawaii. Which event could cause He hit his head on a coral and died?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A big wave knocked Tito off his surfboard. (B) Tito saw the conditions were dangerous.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: A big wave knocking Tito off his surfboard could cause him to hit his head on a coral and die. This is a more plausible answer than Tito seeing the conditions were dangerous because even experienced surfers can misjudge the power of a wave and get knocked off their board. Additionally, hitting coral is a common danger for surfers in Hawaii, and it can be fatal if the impact is severe enough."}}
{"Q": "Larry has decided to help out his friends prepare for a party. Which event could cause Larry decided to stay home from the party?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Larry caught the flu right after the party. (B) Larry caught the flu just before the party started.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Larry caught the flu just before the party started.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Larry would stay home from the party if he caught the flu just before the party started, as he would not want to risk spreading the illness to his friends. If he caught the flu right after the party, it is unlikely that he would have stayed home from the party, as he would have already attended."}}
{"Q": "Mimi and Alice had a favorite hangout spot. Which event could cause Now all they had of their favorite spot were the memories they create?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) the spot get ruined. (B) Mimi and Alice's favorite spot was preserved as a historical location.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) the spot get ruined.\nExplanation: If the spot gets ruined, it would no longer be a suitable place for Mimi and Alice to hang out. They would have to find a new spot, and all they would have left of their old spot would be memories. On the other hand, if the spot was preserved as a historical location, it would still be accessible to Mimi and Alice, and they could continue to visit it. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sarah wanted to mail a card. Which event could cause Sarah's letter was soon heading to its destination?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She put stamps on it. (B) Sarah walked to the mailbox down the road.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She put stamps on it.\nExplanation: Putting stamps on the envelope is necessary for the letter to be processed and delivered by the postal service. Without stamps, the letter would not be considered valid for mailing and would not be sent to its destination. Walking to the mailbox down the road is also important, but it is not the determining factor in whether the letter will reach its destination."}}
{"Q": "Lisa went for her routine bike ride. Which event could cause Some days turn out to be great adventures?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa spotted a cat and followed it off trail. (B) Lisa saw a lot of great food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lisa spotted a cat and followed it off trail.\nExplanation: Following a cat off trail could lead to unexpected paths and discoveries, making the bike ride more adventurous. On the other hand, seeing a lot of great food may be enjoyable but it is unlikely to turn a routine bike ride into a great adventure."}}
{"Q": "Andrea's dad asked her to get firewood. Which event could cause Then, she brought them inside?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Andrea picked up as much wood as she could. (B) Andrea went and found fireflies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Andrea picked up as much wood as she could.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the task her dad asked her to do, which was to get firewood. It makes sense that after picking up the firewood, Andrea would bring it inside to use for the fire. Option B, on the other hand, is not related to the task at hand and does not provide a logical reason for why Andrea would bring firewood inside."}}
{"Q": "Jack had been working super hard for weeks. Which event could cause He got the promotion?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack's boss noticed how hard he ate his food. (B) Jack got called into his boss's office.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jack got called into his boss's office.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack's hard work was noticed by his boss and he was called into his boss's office to discuss a promotion. Eating food has no correlation with work performance and is unlikely to be a factor in getting a promotion."}}
{"Q": "Gina was in the middle of the backseat surrounded by siblings. Which event could cause Gina was disgusted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina's sister got car sick and threw up. (B) Gina's siblings started picking their noses.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gina would be disgusted if her sister got car sick and threw up, as this is a common reaction to seeing or smelling vomit. Picking noses may be gross, but it is less likely to cause a strong feeling of disgust."}}
{"Q": "Sara was walking home from her college class. Which event could cause By the time she got back, it was time to go to school again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sara decided to skip school. (B) Campus construction forced Sara to take a long detour.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Campus construction forced Sara to take a long detour.\nExplanation: If Sara had to take a long detour due to campus construction, it could have delayed her journey home significantly. This delay could have caused her to arrive home later than expected, and if she had to attend school again the next day, it could have been time to go back to school by the time she arrived home. On the other hand, if Sara decided to skip school, it would not have affected her arrival time at home. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The mayor wanted the town to decide how to use the warehouse. Which event could cause The next year he quit his day job and went on the road?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The town was incredibly well ran. (B) Nobody listened to him despite his great ideas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Nobody listened to him despite his great ideas.\nExplanation: If the mayor's ideas were consistently ignored or dismissed by the town, it could lead to frustration and a feeling of being ineffective in his role. This could potentially lead him to quit his day job and pursue other opportunities, such as going on the road. The success or efficiency of the town's operations (choice A) would not necessarily have a direct impact on the mayor's decision to leave his job."}}
{"Q": "Jim ordered a new tablet off of the internet on black friday. Which event could cause They shipped him a new tablet because the other was lost in transit?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He received his tablet the next day. (B) Jim did not receive it and filed a complaint.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jim did not receive it and filed a complaint.\nExplanation: If Jim received his tablet the next day, it is unlikely that the tablet was lost in transit and a new one was shipped to him. However, if Jim did not receive the tablet and filed a complaint, the company may have investigated and found that the tablet was lost in transit, leading them to ship a new one to Jim."}}
{"Q": "Sally really loves to play soccer. Which event could cause She won her first game by scoring the winning goal?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sally practiced playing soccer everyday. (B) Sally was cut from the team.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Sally practiced playing soccer everyday.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sally's hard work and dedication to practicing soccer everyday paid off in her first game by scoring the winning goal. Being cut from the team would not lead to winning a game and scoring the winning goal."}}
{"Q": "Lisa told everyone she was a great cook. Which event could cause Her friends were shocked when it was boxed macaroni and cheese?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lisa does not like to cook prepackaged foods. (B) Lisa, brought the dish out and served everyone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lisa, brought the dish out and served everyone.\nExplanation: If Lisa had claimed to be a great cook and then served boxed macaroni and cheese, her friends would be shocked because boxed macaroni and cheese is not considered a gourmet or homemade dish. If Lisa had stated that she enjoys prepackaged foods, her friends would not have been surprised by her choice of dish. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "May hated doing dishes. Which event could cause May was so relieved that her dishes were all done now?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) May did all of her dishes. (B) May decided to buy paper plates.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. May did all of her dishes.\nExplanation: If May did all of her dishes, then she would no longer have to worry about them and could feel relieved that the task was completed. Buying paper plates would not necessarily solve the problem of having to do dishes, as she would still have to clean up any utensils or cookware used."}}
{"Q": "I was painting my nails yesterday when I needed remover. Which event could cause I had to open the window to get the smell out?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I almost spilled remover all over the floor. (B) I was getting lightheaded looking for it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Nail polish remover contains chemicals that can produce strong fumes, which can cause dizziness and lightheadedness. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person opened the window to get rid of the smell because they were feeling lightheaded from inhaling the fumes, rather than almost spilling the remover on the floor."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy was washing his car. Which event could cause Dirt particles from the cloth had rubbed against his car's paint job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was very careful with the wash. (B) His child ran up and threw mud balls at him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His child ran up and threw mud balls at him.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that dirt particles from the cloth rubbed against the car's paint job due to external factors such as someone throwing mud balls at the car, rather than Jimmy being very careful with the wash. Even if Jimmy was careful, there is still a chance that dirt particles could have been present on the cloth or on the car's surface, which could have caused the rubbing. However, if someone threw mud balls at the car, it is highly likely that dirt particles would have been present on the car's surface, which could have caused the rubbing."}}
{"Q": "Maggie noticed a bat was flying around her ceiling. Which event could cause It was the bat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a screeching sound from below. (B) There was a screeching sound from above.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. There was a screeching sound from above.\n\nExplanation: Bats are known for their echolocation abilities, which they use to navigate and locate prey in the dark. They emit high-pitched sounds that bounce off objects and return to their ears, allowing them to create a mental map of their surroundings. Therefore, if there was a screeching sound from above, it is more likely that the bat was using its echolocation to navigate and fly around the ceiling. A screeching sound from below would not be as plausible since bats typically fly higher up in the air and not close to the ground."}}
{"Q": "Yesterday I went to Macy's. Which event could cause Luckily I was able to return it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I bought a dress in the smallest size that still fit!. (B) The sweater I purchased was too small.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The sweater I purchased was too small.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because if the sweater was too small, it would be a valid reason for the customer to return it. On the other hand, buying a dress in the smallest size that still fits is not necessarily a problem that would require a return."}}
{"Q": "Nina brushed her beautiful brown hair. Which event could cause She forced herself to be more gentle?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nina saw a lot of hair in her brush. (B) Nina noticed she was pulling extra amounts of wax from he scalp.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Nina saw a lot of hair in her brush, it would indicate that she was pulling out more hair than usual, which could cause her to be more gentle in brushing to prevent further hair loss or damage. On the other hand, pulling extra amounts of wax from her scalp would not necessarily lead to Nina being more gentle in brushing her hair."}}
{"Q": "Sally mom told her they didn't have money to pay the light bill. Which event could cause Her mom paid the light bill?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sally reminded her mom had some money in the savings account. (B) Sally's mom gave her money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sally reminded her mom had some money in the savings account.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests a solution to the problem of not having enough money to pay the light bill. If Sally's mom had given her money, it would not have solved the underlying issue of not having enough funds to cover the bill. However, if Sally reminded her mom that they had money in their savings account, they could use that money to pay the bill and avoid any potential consequences of not paying it on time."}}
{"Q": "Michael was playing a video game. Which event could cause He was banned from the game?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Michael left nasty comments on the school forum. (B) Michael began harassing a female player in the game.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Michael began harassing a female player in the game.\nExplanation: Harassment is a serious offense in online gaming communities and can result in a ban. Leaving nasty comments on a school forum may not be directly related to the video game and may not warrant a ban from the game. However, harassing another player in the game is a violation of the game's terms of service and can result in a ban. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack stole a small boy's bike. Which event could cause Jack returned the bike, and hasn't stolen any since?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) As Jack ran away on foot he was hit by a passing car and soiled himself. (B) Jacks mom found out and punished him and made him apologize.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack's mom finding out and punishing him would lead to him returning the bike and not stealing any since. This is because parental punishment and making amends for wrongdoing is a common way to teach children about the consequences of their actions and encourage them to make better choices in the future. On the other hand, getting hit by a car and soiling himself may not necessarily lead to a change in behavior related to stealing bikes."}}
{"Q": "Gina had a friend named Ruth who lived across the street. Which event could cause Gina was shocked since she had no idea Ruth had been stealing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ruth found out Gina got arrested for theft. (B) The cops showed up to raid Ruth's house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The cops showed up to raid Ruth's house.\nExplanation: This event would be more plausible as it directly involves Ruth and her actions. If Ruth was stealing, it is possible that the police would eventually catch on and raid her house. On the other hand, if Gina got arrested for theft, it would not necessarily mean that Ruth was involved or had any knowledge of it. Therefore, option (B) is a more likely scenario that could shock Gina."}}
{"Q": "James was a fire chief who wanted to retire to Florida. Which event could cause The kitchen is always crowded when James makes his Eggplant Parmesan?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) James remaining to make Eggplant Parmesan. (B) After James retired he became a chef.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. James remaining to make Eggplant Parmesan.\nExplanation: The event of James remaining to make Eggplant Parmesan is more plausible as it is related to James' cooking skills and not his retirement or career change. The sentence implies that James is known for his Eggplant Parmesan, and therefore, it is likely that people gather in the kitchen when he makes it. Retirement or becoming a chef does not necessarily have a direct correlation with the crowdedness of the kitchen when James makes his Eggplant Parmesan."}}
{"Q": "Lucy rented a movie to watch at home. Which event could cause Lucy sat with tears running down her face as the credits played?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy watched the movie, though it was thrilling. (B) The move had a sad ending.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The movie had a sad ending.\nExplanation: A sad ending to a movie can often evoke emotions such as sadness or tears. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy would be crying if the movie had a sad ending rather than if it was just thrilling."}}
{"Q": "Chad bought a new car. Which event could cause Chad was reduced to taking the bus and walking once again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) chat got in a car accident. (B) Chad saw a car accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Chad got in a car accident.\nExplanation: If Chad got in a car accident, his car could be damaged beyond repair or require expensive repairs that he cannot afford. This would leave him with no choice but to take the bus or walk until he can either fix his car or buy a new one. On the other hand, seeing a car accident would not necessarily affect Chad's ability to drive his own car."}}
{"Q": "Samantha was drenched in sweat. Which event could cause Samantha was glad that it was just a dream?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She woke up laughing. (B) Samantha had a nightmare.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Samantha had a nightmare.\nExplanation: If Samantha was drenched in sweat, it is more likely that she had a nightmare that caused her to feel scared or anxious, rather than waking up laughing. The physical reaction of sweating is often associated with fear or stress, which would be more likely to occur during a nightmare. Therefore, (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was looking for a flower for his girlfriend today. Which event could cause Tom walked out of the store with the pretty flower in hand?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom looked around a long time for a flower. (B) Tom went to an online flower store.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom looked around a long time for a flower.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that Tom physically went to a store to search for a flower, indicating that he was actively looking for one. Option B suggests that Tom went to an online store, which may not necessarily result in him walking out of a physical store with a flower in hand."}}
{"Q": "Chase had a loose tooth. Which event could cause When his tooth came out he was relieved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Chase was in a good place. (B) Chase jumped on the tramp and his tooth fell out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Chase jumped on the tramp and his tooth fell out.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Chase's tooth fell out due to physical activity, such as jumping on a trampoline, rather than being in a good place. When a tooth is loose, physical activity can cause it to become dislodged. Additionally, the statement \"When his tooth came out he was relieved\" suggests that Chase was experiencing discomfort or pain from the loose tooth, which would be alleviated once it fell out."}}
{"Q": "Steve saw some sushi in the fridge. Which event could cause His roommate was fine with it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Steve ate it and it turned out to be his roommates. (B) It belonged to Steve's roommate. He said if he take him the sushi to night Steve will receive him out for sushi tomorrow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it suggests that the sushi belonged to Steve's roommate and he had given permission for Steve to take it. Additionally, the roommate had offered to treat Steve to sushi the next day, indicating that he was not upset about the situation. Option A suggests that Steve ate his roommate's sushi without permission, which is less likely to result in a positive outcome."}}
{"Q": "Shirley was pregnant and had just gone into labor. Which event could cause Before she could wrap her head around it, her baby was born?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Shirley barely experienced pain. (B) Shirley was excited she was going to become a mom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Shirley barely experienced pain.\nExplanation: It is possible for some women to have a relatively painless labor and delivery, especially if they have received pain management interventions such as epidurals. However, it is unlikely that Shirley's excitement alone would cause her baby to be born before she could even process what was happening."}}
{"Q": "Beth broke her leg. Which event could cause Now it stinks very bad?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Beth's leg was stuck in a cast for several ending. (B) Beth had a cast on for weeks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Beth had a cast on for weeks.\nExplanation: If Beth had a cast on for weeks, it is possible that she was not able to properly clean the area around the cast, leading to a buildup of sweat, bacteria, and other unpleasant odors. This could cause the area to start smelling bad. On the other hand, if Beth's leg was stuck in a cast for several hours or a day, it is less likely that the area would start smelling bad so quickly."}}
{"Q": "There was a rumble in the park. Which event could cause Just then the police showed up?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Noone called the police. (B) Gunshots went off loudly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Gunshots went off loudly.\nExplanation: Gunshots are a serious and potentially dangerous event that would likely prompt someone to call the police. The loud noise would also attract attention and cause concern among those in the park. Therefore, it is more plausible that the police were called due to gunshots rather than no one calling them at all."}}
{"Q": "Jon wanted to know more about birds, so he went to the library. Which event could cause Jon ran out of the library and never went there again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jon's peers made fun of the book he chose. (B) Jon saw a bird that flew inside the library book.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jon's peers making fun of the book he chose would cause him to feel embarrassed and not want to return to the library. Seeing a bird fly inside the library book is unlikely and would not necessarily cause Jon to never return to the library again."}}
{"Q": "Joey accidentally drove his truck off the road Christmas morning. Which event could cause Joey made it home in time for Christmas dinner?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joey happened to have AAA. (B) Joey was stranded for more than five minutes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Joey happened to have AAA.\n\nExplanation: If Joey had AAA, he could have called for roadside assistance and gotten his truck towed back onto the road or to a nearby mechanic. This would have allowed him to make it home in time for Christmas dinner. On the other hand, if Joey was stranded for more than five minutes, it is unlikely that he would have been able to get his truck back on the road and make it home in time for dinner."}}
{"Q": "Brenda went on a vacation to Vegas. Which event could cause She left Vegas knowing she had a good time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Brenda forgot to go dance and gamble. (B) She danced and gambled the whole time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She danced and gambled the whole time.\n\nExplanation: If Brenda spent the whole time dancing and gambling, it is likely that she had a good time and enjoyed herself. On the other hand, if she forgot to do these activities, it suggests that she did not have a fulfilling experience and may not have had a good time. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Beth had to choose between universities. Which event could cause Beth decided to stay at home and go to school close by?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Beth didn't want to be away from her family and friends. (B) Beth did not want to pay for student housing, so decided to squat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Beth didn't want to be away from her family and friends.\nExplanation: It is a common reason for students to choose a university close to home. Being away from family and friends can be difficult for some students, and they may prefer to stay close to their support system. On the other hand, the option of squatting is not a realistic or legal option for most students, and it is unlikely that Beth would choose this as a reason to stay at home."}}
{"Q": "Lia was starting high school at a new school. Which event could cause Lia made many friends on her first day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lia talked to many new teachers. (B) Lia was an outgoing person, so she quickly introduced herself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Lia being an outgoing person and quickly introducing herself is a more plausible event that could cause her to make many friends on her first day of high school. Being friendly and approachable can make it easier for others to initiate conversations and form connections with Lia. While talking to new teachers may be helpful in getting to know the school and its resources, it is less likely to result in making many friends on the first day."}}
{"Q": "Jack works at an auto body shop. Which event could cause They're afraid to give the owner the bill?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack crashed an expensive car. (B) Jack had to get the car lift repaired it was very expensive.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Jack crashed an expensive car, it would be understandable for him and his colleagues to be afraid to give the owner the bill. The cost of repairing the car could be very high, and the owner may be upset or angry about the damage. In contrast, if Jack had to get the car lift repaired, while it may be expensive, it is not as likely to cause fear in giving the owner the bill."}}
{"Q": "Four Outlaws camped in Blood Gulch. Which event could cause He let them go free?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The guard cheked them to see what they were wearing. (B) The sheriff bribed the outlaws with his ill-gotten gains.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the guard checked the outlaws to see what they were wearing and found that they were not the ones responsible for the recent crimes in the area. This would provide a valid reason for letting them go free. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the sheriff would bribe the outlaws with his ill-gotten gains as it would go against his duty to uphold the law and bring criminals to justice."}}
{"Q": "Eli was a fan of the Walking Dead and all his friends knew it. Which event could cause Eli was sentenced to life in prison for his reckless behavior?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eli tried to watch the show in real life. (B) Eli attacked one of his friends, laughing and proclaiming she was a zombie.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Eli attacked one of his friends, laughing and proclaiming she was a zombie.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible as it involves Eli's reckless behavior towards his friend, which could result in serious harm or injury. Watching the show in real life is not possible, and even if Eli attempted it, it would not necessarily result in a life sentence. However, attacking someone and claiming they are a zombie is a serious offense and could lead to severe consequences."}}
{"Q": "Jan and Kim were both using the Montessori education model. Which event could cause Jan threw away the books?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Montessori model does not focus on textbooks. (B) The Montessori model does not work without textbooks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: The Montessori education model emphasizes hands-on learning and exploration, rather than relying solely on textbooks. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jan threw away the books because she realized they were not necessary for the Montessori approach, rather than because she believed the model could not work without them."}}
{"Q": "Ashley had been working hard at work. Which event could cause She happily accepted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ashley was offered a demotion. (B) Ashley was ask if she wants a promotion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Ashley was asked if she wants a promotion.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ashley would happily accept being asked if she wants a promotion, as it would indicate that her hard work has been recognized and rewarded with a potential career advancement. On the other hand, being offered a demotion would not be a cause for happiness, as it would suggest that her performance has not been satisfactory."}}
{"Q": "Tommy was scared of skating. Which event could cause He always loved skating after that?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His big brother spent a week teaching him to skate. (B) Tommy realized that he was really good at eating.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His big brother spent a week teaching him to skate.\n\nExplanation: If Tommy's big brother spent a week teaching him to skate, it is likely that he would gain confidence and improve his skills. With practice and support from his brother, Tommy may overcome his fear of skating and develop a love for it. On the other hand, realizing that he is good at eating is not related to skating and would not likely change his fear or interest in the activity."}}
{"Q": "Jane wanted to wear a shirt. Which event could cause She returned it and apologized?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) she bought a scarf that was the wrong size. (B) Jane realized the shirt was too small.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jane realized the shirt was too small.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jane returned the shirt and apologized because it did not fit her, rather than buying a scarf that was the wrong size. If the shirt was too small, it would be a valid reason for her to return it and apologize for any inconvenience caused. On the other hand, buying a scarf that was the wrong size would not necessarily lead to returning a shirt and apologizing."}}
{"Q": "Dan took his daughter to the beach. Which event could cause They came back the next day and built one again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan and his daughter built a huge sandcastle right after a wave came in and washed it away. (B) Dan and his daughter built a sandcastle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: If Dan and his daughter built a sandcastle and nothing happened to it, there would be no reason for them to come back the next day and build another one. However, if a wave came in and washed away their sandcastle, they may have been motivated to come back and try again. This scenario is more plausible and provides a clear reason for why they would build another sandcastle the next day."}}
{"Q": "While walking his pet lizard, he didn't think he was breaking the law. Which event could cause He gave the lizard's owner a ticket?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Having a lizard is illegal in that town. (B) A police officer said hi to the lizard owner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Having a lizard is illegal in that town.\nExplanation: If having a lizard is illegal in that town, then the lizard's owner would be breaking the law by walking the pet lizard. Therefore, the police officer could give the lizard's owner a ticket for breaking the law. On the other hand, a police officer saying hi to the lizard owner would not be a valid reason for giving a ticket."}}
{"Q": "I was invited to a party from a somewhat friend. Which event could cause First party that I wanted to be over fast?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was very boring. (B) All of his friends were nice and I felt comfortable.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was very boring.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the party would be unpleasant if it was boring and uneventful. If the party was enjoyable and the person felt comfortable with the host's friends, they would likely want to stay longer and have a good time."}}
{"Q": "I played an April Fools joke on my friend in 2007. Which event could cause She was very excited until she found out it was a trick?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I told her I was getting her an cheap gift. (B) I maid her think she won the lottery.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I made her think she won the lottery.\nExplanation: This event would likely cause excitement because winning the lottery is a big deal and can bring a lot of joy and excitement. However, finding out it was a trick would likely cause disappointment and frustration. On the other hand, telling someone you're getting them a cheap gift may not necessarily cause excitement in the first place, so it's less likely to be the answer."}}
{"Q": "Reggie and Ally were laying on the ground looking up at the sky. Which event could cause To her Reggie's dinosaur looked like a bunny?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were looking at clouds shape. (B) Reggie and Ally were looking for shapes in the clouds. Ally said one cloud looked like a dinosaur. Reggie disagreed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Reggie and Ally were looking at cloud shapes, it is more plausible that Reggie's dinosaur looked like a bunny because cloud shapes can often be interpreted in different ways depending on the viewer's perspective. It is common for people to see different shapes and objects in clouds, and this can be influenced by their personal experiences and imagination. On the other hand, if Ally specifically pointed out a cloud that looked like a dinosaur and Reggie disagreed, it is less likely that he would suddenly see it as a bunny without any external factors influencing his perception."}}
{"Q": "Dana loved his gold chain. Which event could cause He sold his $200 gold chain for $20 to a passerby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dana, lost his wallet and needed money. (B) Dana got into debt very badly and needed $200.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Dana lost his wallet and needed money, rather than getting into debt badly and needing exactly $200. Losing a wallet can happen to anyone and can cause a sudden need for cash. Additionally, selling a $200 gold chain for only $20 suggests that Dana was in a desperate situation and needed money quickly."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was watching a huge lightning storm. Which event could cause Luckily they were able to put it out easily?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A bolt of lightning hit the tv antennae. (B) Lightning struck and started a small fire.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lightning struck and started a small fire.\nExplanation: While a bolt of lightning hitting a TV antennae could potentially cause damage or a fire, it is less likely than lightning striking and starting a small fire. Additionally, the statement \"Luckily they were able to put it out easily\" implies that the fire was small and easily manageable."}}
{"Q": "Every morning I wake up to the bird's crow. Which event could cause I know it's morning when I hear the bird's crow?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I saw the bird's feathers. (B) I no longer turn on my alarm clock.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If the person no longer turns on their alarm clock, it suggests that they have established a routine of waking up to the bird's crow. This routine would likely occur consistently in the morning, allowing the person to associate the sound of the bird's crow with the start of their day. Seeing the bird's feathers (choice A) does not necessarily have any correlation with the time of day or the person's waking routine."}}
{"Q": "Lars had always wanted to try photography. Which event could cause Lars hated photography?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lars finally tried photography and was terrible. (B) Lars quickly discovered that photography was easier and more exciting than he had anticipated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lars finally tried photography and was terrible.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that if Lars tried photography and was terrible at it, he may become discouraged and lose interest in pursuing it further. This is a common experience for many people who try new hobbies or skills and do not immediately excel at them. On the other hand, if Lars quickly discovered that photography was easier and more exciting than he had anticipated, it is unlikely that he would suddenly hate it."}}
{"Q": "Yesterday was Lauren's Birthday. Which event could cause She loved the cake and ate 2 pieces after blowing out the candles?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I made her a pie. (B) Lauren was excited to see a cake with candles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lauren was excited to see a cake with candles.\nExplanation: It is a common tradition to have a cake with candles on someone's birthday. Lauren's excitement to see the cake with candles suggests that she was looking forward to having a slice of cake. Additionally, the fact that she ate two pieces after blowing out the candles indicates that she enjoyed the cake. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) is not a likely cause for Lauren loving the cake and eating two pieces since it mentions making her a pie, not a cake."}}
{"Q": "Nita was playing rummy with her dad. Which event could cause Nita hated playing rummy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nita lost as she always does. (B) Nita just crushed it as she always does of course.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Nita lost as she always does.\nExplanation: Losing repeatedly can be frustrating and demotivating, which could cause Nita to hate playing rummy. On the other hand, winning consistently (option B) would likely make her enjoy the game even more. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Michelle had a big test on Friday. Which event could cause They both laughed for a while and crammed extra hard?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Michelle studied with her friend. (B) Michelle did not study.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Michelle studied with her friend.\nExplanation: If Michelle studied with her friend, it is possible that they both found the material difficult or challenging, which could have led to them laughing and cramming extra hard. Additionally, studying with a friend can be a motivating factor and can help alleviate some of the stress associated with taking a big test. On the other hand, if Michelle did not study, it is unlikely that she would have been laughing and cramming extra hard, as she may have been too stressed or anxious about the test."}}
{"Q": "Linda went to buy some frozen yogurt. Which event could cause Linda was very pleased?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The store had Linda's favorite brands at a new higher price. (B) The store had Linda's favorite brands at a new lower price.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The store had Linda's favorite brands at a new lower price.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Linda would be pleased if the store had her favorite brands at a new lower price because she would be able to purchase her favorite frozen yogurt at a more affordable price. On the other hand, if the store had her favorite brands at a new higher price, Linda would likely be disappointed or frustrated that she would have to pay more for the same product."}}
{"Q": "Rena had a tattoo she didn't like. Which event could cause One hour later,the new cover up tattoo was finished over the old one?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rena went to the tattoo parlor to get another one. (B) She decided to get a cover up tatoo.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She decided to get a cover up tattoo.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rena decided to get a cover up tattoo to hide the old one she didn't like, rather than going to a tattoo parlor to get another one in such a short time frame. Getting a cover up tattoo is a common solution for people who regret their tattoos or want to change them."}}
{"Q": "Miss Susie was counting the kids in her class getting on the bus. Which event could cause The kids and Miss Susie got on the bus to go back to school?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were coming back from a field trip. (B) Miss Susie counted all the chickens.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They were coming back from a field trip.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Miss Susie and the kids were getting on the bus to go back to school after a field trip, rather than Miss Susie counting chickens. Counting chickens does not seem like a typical activity for a teacher to do with her class, whereas field trips are a common educational experience for students."}}
{"Q": "A florist began to make a bouquet of red roses. Which event could cause The bouquet was sold to a customer moments later?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The florist put the bouquet in overnight storage. (B) She placed the bouquet in her front display case.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She placed the bouquet in her front display case.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the bouquet was sold to a customer moments later if it was placed in the front display case, where customers can easily see and purchase it. If the florist put the bouquet in overnight storage, it is unlikely that it would be sold moments later."}}
{"Q": "Randall wants to play with other kids in his class. Which event could cause Randall gladly shared his toy with his new friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A boy from his class came over and asked him play, but he said no. (B) The kids saw his toy and wanted to play.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If the kids saw Randall's toy and wanted to play with it, it would likely make him happy to share it with them. This shows that he is willing to engage with his classmates and share his belongings, which is a positive social behavior. On the other hand, if a boy asked him to play and he said no, it suggests that he may not be interested in socializing with his peers or sharing his toys."}}
{"Q": "George's stomach growled. Which event could cause Grinning, he mixed them together and enjoyed a bowl of tomato soup?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He grabbed some crackers from the table nearby and found a can of soup. (B) George made some Chinese food for dinner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that George grabbed some crackers from the table nearby and found a can of soup because the sentence \"George's stomach growled\" implies that he was hungry and looking for something to eat. Additionally, the sentence \"Grinning, he mixed them together and enjoyed a bowl of tomato soup\" suggests that he quickly made a simple meal, which would be more likely with a can of soup and crackers than with a complex Chinese dish."}}
{"Q": "June liked to practice yoga often. Which event could cause June practiced her yoga at the park in a secluded spot?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) June liked to do yoga late at night. (B) June liked to practice yoga outside at lunch.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) June liked to practice yoga outside at lunch.\nExplanation: Since June liked to practice yoga often, it is more plausible that she would choose a time during the day to practice rather than late at night. Additionally, practicing yoga outside during lunchtime would provide a break from work or other daily activities and allow her to enjoy the fresh air and nature. Choosing a secluded spot in the park would also provide privacy and a peaceful environment for her practice."}}
{"Q": "May was a big fan of the singing group Pentatonix. Which event could cause Later that month May went to see and meet the band members?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) May won a radio contest to meet the band. (B) May bought counterfeit tickets online.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. May won a radio contest to meet the band.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that May won a radio contest to meet the band as it is a common promotional tactic used by radio stations to increase their listenership and promote the band. On the other hand, buying counterfeit tickets online is illegal and risky, and it is unlikely that May would take such a chance to meet her favorite band."}}
{"Q": "Jon was driving to work. Which event could cause Jon turned around and drove home to change into clean clothes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jon spilled coffee on himself. (B) Jon realized he had put on a dirt, smelly shoe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jon spilled coffee on himself.\nExplanation: Spilling coffee on oneself is a common occurrence and can be embarrassing, especially if it leaves a noticeable stain or odor. It is also understandable that Jon would want to change into clean clothes before going to work to avoid any further embarrassment or discomfort. On the other hand, realizing that one has put on a dirty and smelly shoe may not be as urgent of a reason to turn around and go home to change."}}
{"Q": "Peter and Kevin grew up in a small town. Which event could cause Their sons are the best of friends, and play on the same team?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Peter and Kevin's daughters like the same sports. (B) Peter and Kevin had kids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Peter and Kevin had kids.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Peter and Kevin's sons became friends and played on the same team because their fathers were friends and likely spent time together, which could have led to their children spending time together as well. The fact that they had sons also increases the likelihood that they would share similar interests, such as playing on the same sports team. The option of their daughters liking the same sports is not as likely to lead to their sons becoming best friends and playing on the same team."}}
{"Q": "Jeff lived in an apartment. Which event could cause Jeff moved out of his apartment?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jeff decided to buy a hot tub. (B) Jeff wanted a place with a big yard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jeff wanted a place with a big yard.\nExplanation: Since Jeff lived in an apartment, it is unlikely that he would be able to install a hot tub. Additionally, if Jeff wanted a big yard, it would be more practical for him to move to a house rather than trying to find an apartment with a large outdoor space. Therefore, option B is a more plausible reason for Jeff to move out of his apartment."}}
{"Q": "Allison was entered to be in a competitive eating contest. Which event could cause Allison did not do well in the contest and didn't win?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Allison tried really hard to eat all the hotdogs. (B) Allison had frequently done things like this before.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Allison tried really hard to eat all the hotdogs.\n\nExplanation: Even if Allison had frequently done things like this before, if she tried really hard to eat all the hotdogs, she could still potentially do well in the contest. However, if she didn't do well and didn't win, it's more likely that she struggled to eat all the hotdogs despite her efforts. Competitive eating requires a combination of speed, technique, and endurance, so even if someone has experience with eating large quantities of food, they may not necessarily excel in a contest if they can't keep up with the pace or handle the specific food items."}}
{"Q": "Sally wanted to give her Mom something special for her birthday. Which event could cause Sally made a pretty pink necklace out of beads for her Mom's birthday?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she went shopping and found a nice jewelry craft set. (B) Sally had already bought her a gift.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: If Sally went shopping and found a nice jewelry craft set, it would make sense that she would use it to make a special gift for her Mom's birthday. It is unlikely that Sally would have already bought her Mom a gift and then decided to make a necklace as well. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jeremy's mother didn't approve of his lifestyle. Which event could cause Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jeremy got a job and moved out. (B) Jeremy got a job and moved in.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jeremy got a job and moved out.\nExplanation: If Jeremy's mother didn't approve of his lifestyle, it's likely that she had some expectations of him being more responsible. Getting a job and moving out would show that Jeremy is taking steps towards being more independent and responsible, which could potentially improve his relationship with his mother and make him feel more fulfilled. On the other hand, getting a job and moving in with his mother would not necessarily change his lifestyle or show any significant growth or responsibility."}}
{"Q": "Morgan enjoyed long walks on the beach. Which event could cause Her boyfriend was upset he didn't propose to her first?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) her boyfriend wants to marry her for sure. (B) Morgan's boyfriend didn't like the beach but her best friend Mike always went with her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Morgan's boyfriend wants to marry her for sure, he may feel upset that he didn't propose to her first during one of their long walks on the beach. This is a more plausible answer than (B) because Morgan's boyfriend not liking the beach and her best friend Mike always going with her does not necessarily have a direct connection to him being upset about not proposing first."}}
{"Q": "The kids were at the beach. Which event could cause They loved jumping the waves?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kids loved waves. (B) The kids played in the water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The kids played in the water.\nExplanation: Since the sentence mentions that the kids were at the beach, it is more plausible that they were playing in the water. Additionally, the phrase \"jumping the waves\" suggests an activity that involves being in the water. Therefore, option (B) is a more likely event that could cause the kids to love jumping the waves. Option (A) is not necessarily incorrect, but it is not as specific or likely based on the given sentence."}}
{"Q": "Rachel bought a goldfish for her child. Which event could cause Her child asked her why his fish lost so much weight?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The goldfish appeared to lose weight rapidly. (B) Her child did not feed the dog.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the goldfish appeared to lose weight rapidly, it would be a plausible reason for the child to ask why. However, the fact that the child did not feed the dog would not be a relevant factor in the goldfish's weight loss."}}
{"Q": "I came home from work one day. Which event could cause I made a delicious stir fry and ate it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wanted to try something new with my leftovers. (B) I was hungry so I went into the kitchen and ordered something to eat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person made a delicious stir fry and ate it because they wanted to try something new with their leftovers. This suggests that the person had some leftover ingredients in their fridge and decided to experiment with them to create a tasty meal. On the other hand, it is less likely that the person would order something to eat from the kitchen as they would have to wait for the food to be prepared and delivered, which would take longer than making a stir fry from leftovers."}}
{"Q": "Ted like to park as close to his office building as possible. Which event could cause Ted never saw the car parked in two spaces again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ted accidentally washed a car parked in two spaces. (B) Someone hit Ted's car.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Someone hit Ted's car.\n\nExplanation: If someone were to hit Ted's car while it was parked in two spaces, it could cause him to become more cautious and park in a single space to avoid any further damage. On the other hand, accidentally washing a car parked in two spaces would not necessarily change Ted's parking habits. Therefore, (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Thunder rumbled in the distance as the rain began to fall. Which event could cause The flash of lightning threw eerie shadows on the wall?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was trying to sleep. (B) I went outside to watch the storm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The flash of lightning is a visual phenomenon that occurs during a thunderstorm. It is unlikely that the lightning would be visible from inside a building, especially if the person is trying to sleep. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person went outside to watch the storm and witnessed the flash of lightning throwing eerie shadows on the wall."}}
{"Q": "Erica was in a hurry in the morning. Which event could cause She arrived at work on time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Erica loved to be late to work. (B) Erica drove fast in her car.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Erica drove fast in her car.\nExplanation: If Erica was in a hurry in the morning, it is more likely that she would try to get to work on time rather than intentionally being late. Therefore, option (A) is not a plausible answer. On the other hand, if Erica drove fast in her car, she could have saved some time and arrived at work on time. Hence, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Heather had four children. Which event could cause Heather was mortified when she stood and found her pants soaked?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) While holding one of them, she felt something dry in her lap. (B) Heather's kids played a prank on her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. While holding one of them, she felt something dry in her lap.\nExplanation: This scenario suggests that Heather may have been holding one of her children and not realized that they had an accident, causing her pants to become soaked. This is a common occurrence for parents of young children and is a more plausible explanation than her children playing a prank on her."}}
{"Q": "Erica has always liked to dress formally for any occasion. Which event could cause Erica wishes she hadn't always been so formal?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) her dresses were so expensive and casual. (B) Erica went to a party and was stared at. Everyone was casually dressed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Erica went to a party and was stared at. Everyone was casually dressed.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because it directly relates to Erica's preference for formal attire and how it may not be appropriate for every occasion. It also highlights the social discomfort she may feel when she stands out from the crowd due to her clothing choice. Option (A) does not necessarily cause Erica to regret her preference for formal attire, but rather highlights the cost of her clothing."}}
{"Q": "Kevin made Peruvian style chicken at a stall in New York City. Which event could cause Kevin was later given a health code violation and had to close shop?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kevin used different boards to cut chicken and onions. (B) Kevin used the same board to cut chicken and onions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kevin used the same board to cut chicken and onions.\n\nExplanation: Using the same board to cut chicken and onions can lead to cross-contamination, which is a violation of health codes. Cross-contamination can cause foodborne illnesses, which can be harmful to customers. Therefore, it is more plausible that this event caused Kevin to receive a health code violation and had to close his shop."}}
{"Q": "Ricky fell while hiking in the woods. Which event could cause Ricky was soaking wet from falling in the pond?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rick rolled into a pond. (B) Ricky fell into the grass below.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rick rolled into a pond.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ricky fell into a pond and got soaking wet rather than falling into grass and getting wet. Falling into grass would not typically result in being soaking wet, whereas falling into a pond would. Therefore, option A is the more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "Leila went on safari in Africa. Which event could cause Leila would remember the safari for many years to come?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Leila saw lions and elephants, and tried lots of terrible foods. (B) She so enjoyed the animals and living out of a tent.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Seeing lions and elephants and trying terrible foods may be memorable, but it is not necessarily a unique experience that would stand out in Leila's memory for many years. However, enjoying the animals and living out of a tent is a more unique and immersive experience that could create lasting memories for Leila."}}
{"Q": "James had a vision of a product to save lives. Which event could cause James went to market with the idea, anyway?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) James developed it with some positive feedback. (B) James couldn't find a way to make it cheap.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. James developed it with some positive feedback.\nExplanation: If James received positive feedback on his product idea, it would give him the confidence and motivation to pursue it further and bring it to market. Positive feedback could come from potential customers, industry experts, or even friends and family who believe in the idea. On the other hand, if James couldn't find a way to make it cheap, it would be a barrier to bringing the product to market, but it wouldn't necessarily prevent him from pursuing the idea altogether. James could explore alternative manufacturing methods or pricing strategies to make the product more affordable."}}
{"Q": "I was walking in the park. Which event could cause I had to throw away my shoes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wasn't careful and stepped in dog poop. (B) I stepped in a pile of mud and realized I had a hole in my shirt.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I wasn't careful and stepped in dog poop.\nExplanation: It is more likely that stepping in dog poop would require throwing away shoes as it is difficult to clean and can leave a strong odor. Stepping in mud, on the other hand, can usually be cleaned off and would not necessarily require throwing away shoes. Additionally, the fact that the person was not careful suggests that they may not have been paying close attention to where they were walking, making it more likely that they would step in something like dog poop."}}
{"Q": "Karl bought a new rug. Which event could cause When he got a new one he didn't let the dog near it for a while?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Karl was afraid his dog would steal the rug. (B) Karl's dog immediately urinated on it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Karl's dog immediately urinated on it.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Karl didn't let his dog near the new rug because he was worried that the dog might urinate on it, especially if the dog has a history of doing so. This is a common concern for pet owners when introducing new items into their homes. On the other hand, it is less likely that Karl was afraid his dog would steal the rug, as dogs are not known for stealing household items like rugs."}}
{"Q": "Remy was always good at playing soccer. Which event could cause Remy was surprised when they both were awarded the scholarship?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her sister was even better than Remy. (B) Remy had a rival who played as well as she.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her sister was even better than Remy.\nExplanation: If Remy always knew she was good at playing soccer, it would be unlikely for her to be surprised if she had a rival who played as well as she did. However, if Remy's sister was also good at playing soccer and was awarded the scholarship alongside Remy, it would be a surprising event for Remy as she may have always thought of herself as the better player."}}
{"Q": "Ryan wanted to treat his friends. Which event could cause Everyone liked it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ryan invited his closest friends to the restaurant and treated them to lunch. (B) Ryan took them to his favorite restaurant for dinner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ryan invited his closest friends to the restaurant and treated them to lunch.\n\nExplanation: Inviting close friends to a restaurant and treating them to a meal is a kind gesture that is likely to be appreciated by everyone. Lunch is also a more casual and relaxed mealtime, which could contribute to a positive experience. On the other hand, taking friends to a favorite restaurant for dinner may not necessarily guarantee that everyone will like it, as people have different tastes and preferences when it comes to food."}}
{"Q": "Billy decided to collect insects. Which event could cause Billy decided that he enjoyed his new hobby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Billy found a lot of bugs. (B) she is the best.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Billy found a lot of bugs.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Billy would enjoy his new hobby if he found a lot of bugs to collect. This would give him a sense of accomplishment and excitement about his new hobby. On the other hand, the statement \"she is the best\" is unrelated to Billy's hobby of collecting insects and does not provide a plausible explanation for why he would enjoy it."}}
{"Q": "Leah loved fireflies. Which event could cause So, she admired the fireflies from her window instead?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Leah couldn't watch the fireflies outside. (B) She wanted one as a pet, and thought that would be fun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Leah couldn't watch the fireflies outside.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it suggests that there was some obstacle preventing Leah from going outside to watch the fireflies, such as bad weather or an illness. It also makes sense that Leah would still want to admire the fireflies from her window if she couldn't go outside to see them. Option B, on the other hand, seems less likely because fireflies are not typically kept as pets and it would be difficult to catch and care for one."}}
{"Q": "Tim went on a date. Which event could cause Leslie loved the date?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim took Leslie on a romantic bear hunt. (B) Tim went to the movies with Leslie.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Tim went to the movies with Leslie.\nExplanation: Going to the movies is a common and popular date activity that many people enjoy. It allows for the couple to spend time together, share a common experience, and potentially have a chance to talk and get to know each other better. On the other hand, going on a romantic bear hunt may not be as appealing or feasible for everyone, and could potentially be dangerous or uncomfortable for Leslie. Therefore, it is more plausible that Leslie loved the date if Tim took her to the movies."}}
{"Q": "Emma wanted to learn how to sew. Which event could cause Now Emma can make a full wardrobe?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Emma went for sewing lessons. (B) Emma took some clothes and was good at it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Emma went for sewing lessons.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Emma learned how to sew by taking sewing lessons rather than just being naturally good at it by trying to sew some clothes. Taking lessons would provide her with the necessary skills and knowledge to create a full wardrobe, while just being good at it without any formal training may not be enough to create a variety of clothing items."}}
{"Q": "Bob decided to hike in the jungles of Indonesia. Which event could cause Bob had always been reckless?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob decided to turn back when he realized he wasn't properly equipped for the hike. (B) Bob forgot to bring a canteen and died of dehydration.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Bob forgetting to bring a canteen and dying of dehydration is a more plausible event that could happen if Bob had always been reckless. Forgetting such an essential item for a hike in the jungle shows a lack of preparation and care for his own safety, which is consistent with reckless behavior. Turning back when realizing he wasn't properly equipped, on the other hand, shows a level of caution and responsibility, which is not consistent with reckless behavior."}}
{"Q": "Sam and his wife were busy packing for their trip. Which event could cause Sam wanted to get away from his wife as soon as possible?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam's wife flirted with other men on the trip. (B) She was getting angry because he already packed his suitcase the way she told him to.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She was getting angry because he already packed his suitcase the way she told him to.\n\nExplanation: This scenario suggests that Sam's wife is controlling and possibly difficult to deal with. Sam may want to get away from her as soon as possible to avoid any further conflicts or stress. On the other hand, option (A) suggests that Sam's wife is unfaithful, which is a serious issue that would likely cause more than just a desire to get away from her. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "We were driving through the Blue Ridge Mountains in the early spring. Which event could cause The next morning, the ranger told us that a bear had been spotted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We kept driving nonstop until we arrived. (B) We had stopped and decided to camp at a rest area because we were tired from driving.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. We had stopped and decided to camp at a rest area because we were tired from driving.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a bear would be spotted in a rest area where there is food and garbage, rather than on a road where cars are constantly passing by. Additionally, camping in the mountains increases the chances of encountering wildlife."}}
{"Q": "Anna was making a world atlas. Which event could cause Then she colored in her atlas?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna drew her world cotton balls. (B) Anna drew her world atlas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Anna drew her world atlas.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anna would color in her world atlas after she had already drawn it, rather than coloring it in before she had even created it. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely event that would cause Anna to color in her atlas."}}
{"Q": "Leslie is my boss and she is very good at her job. Which event could cause I should listen to her more because she has promoted me twice?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Leslie treats me like she does not like me. (B) Leslie treats me with respect.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Leslie treats me with respect.\nExplanation: If Leslie treats the person with respect, it indicates that she values their work and contribution to the company. Additionally, the fact that Leslie has promoted the person twice suggests that she recognizes their potential and trusts them to take on more responsibility. Therefore, it would be wise to listen to her advice and guidance as she has proven to be a successful leader and mentor. On the other hand, if Leslie treats the person poorly, it may be more difficult to trust her judgment and follow her advice."}}
{"Q": "Charlie had left his beloved stuffed monkey on the school bus. Which event could cause After carefully searching it, he found the lost monkey?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Charlie went back to search the bus. (B) Charlie look for a few minutes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Charlie went back to search the bus.\nExplanation: If Charlie had left his stuffed monkey on the school bus, the most plausible event that could lead to him finding it would be if he went back to search the bus. It is unlikely that he would find it by just looking for a few minutes, especially if it had fallen under a seat or was hidden from view. Therefore, option A is the most likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "My roommates put up their Christmas tree this year. Which event could cause This is what it's like living with a cat?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The roommates soon had to take the tree down. (B) The cat enjoyed the ornaments and garland and slept under the tree.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The cat enjoyed the ornaments and garland and slept under the tree.\nExplanation: It is a common behavior of cats to be attracted to shiny and dangling objects, such as Christmas ornaments and garlands. They may play with them, bat them around, or even climb the tree. It is also common for cats to seek out cozy and warm places to sleep, and the area under the Christmas tree can provide just that. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cat would enjoy the tree rather than causing the roommates to take it down."}}
{"Q": "Joe went to college for art. Which event could cause Joe hated pizza?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Because of his Italian heritage people called him \"Pizza Joe.\". (B) and hated art.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Joe had a bad experience with pizza and developed an aversion to it.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe's dislike of pizza is unrelated to his college major or heritage. It is possible that Joe had a bad experience with pizza, such as getting sick after eating it, and developed an aversion to it. This would not be related to his art studies or Italian heritage."}}
{"Q": "Jason woke up late one morning. Which event could cause Jason swore he would never make that mistake again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jason aced his exam and his professor congratulated him. (B) Jason missed the train to go for office.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Jason missed the train to go for office due to waking up late, it could have caused him to be late for work and face consequences such as a reprimand from his boss or missing important meetings. This could be a more plausible reason for Jason to swear he would never make the mistake of waking up late again. On the other hand, acing an exam and receiving congratulations from a professor may not necessarily be related to waking up late and may not have a significant impact on Jason's future behavior."}}
{"Q": "I was on the track and field team in high school. Which event could cause At the end, I lost all my energy and got 5th place?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I trained a lot for a meet. (B) I didn't practice much.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I trained a lot for a meet.\nExplanation: If the person trained a lot for a meet, it is more likely that they pushed themselves to their limits during the event, causing them to lose all their energy and end up in 5th place. On the other hand, if they didn't practice much, they may not have had the stamina to compete at a high level in the first place. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I invited my two male friends over to fix my car. Which event could cause I was so shocked, I immediately kicked both of them out?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) they were kissing when I walked back outside. (B) They both didn't know how to fix it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the shock and immediate action of kicking them out would be caused by seeing them engage in a behavior that is unexpected and potentially uncomfortable for the person. On the other hand, if they didn't know how to fix the car, it may have been frustrating or disappointing, but it is less likely to cause such a strong reaction."}}
{"Q": "Sandy and Bob set out to break a world record. Which event could cause Sandy was mad that they did all that work for nothing?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They almost set it but missed by 2 seconds. (B) Sandy and Bob tried to build the biggest ladder in the world, but they did not have enough time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If Sandy and Bob tried to build the biggest ladder in the world but did not have enough time, it would be a clear failure and a waste of their effort. On the other hand, missing a world record by just 2 seconds would still be a significant achievement and could motivate them to try again in the future. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kelly loved to paint. Which event could cause And to her great surprise, she won first place?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kelly entered her painting in a contest. (B) Kelly decided to enter a singing contest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kelly entered her painting in a contest.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kelly winning first place in a painting contest is due to her entering her painting in a competition, rather than suddenly deciding to enter a singing contest. The sentence states that Kelly loved to paint, indicating that she had a passion for it and likely had experience in creating artwork. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she would enter her painting in a contest and potentially win first place."}}
{"Q": "I hate grooming. Which event could cause I had to cut my hair off?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I messed up on my right side of my car. (B) Because it's too difficult to maintenance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Because it's too difficult to maintenance.\nExplanation: If someone hates grooming, it is likely that they would avoid maintaining their hair regularly. Over time, this could lead to tangles, knots, and split ends, making it difficult to manage. As a result, they may choose to cut their hair off to avoid the hassle of maintaining it. On the other hand, messing up on the right side of their car would not necessarily lead to cutting off their hair."}}
{"Q": "Marsha had just moved in with her husband. Which event could cause Marsha was devastated?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her husband had a miscarriage due to stress. (B) Marsha was told by the landlord she would not be able to keep her dog.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Marsha was told by the landlord she would not be able to keep her dog.\n\nExplanation: This event is more plausible as it directly affects Marsha and her personal life. Losing a pet can be devastating for many people, especially if it is a beloved companion. On the other hand, it is not possible for a man to have a miscarriage as only women can carry and give birth to a child. Therefore, option (A) is not a plausible event."}}
{"Q": "Tim took a summer job on a farm. Which event could cause He also earned a deep, dark tan?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had the chance to gamble. (B) Tim earned good money for his tuition.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tim earned good money for his tuition.\nExplanation: Working on a farm during the summer would involve spending a lot of time outdoors, which could lead to getting a deep, dark tan. It is unlikely that gambling would have any effect on Tim's tan. However, working and earning money for tuition would be a plausible reason for Tim to take a summer job on a farm."}}
{"Q": "Becky wanted to improve her cooking skills so she signed up for class. Which event could cause Her boyfriend agreed as well?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Becky had not cooked good food. (B) Becky hated her first class and asked her boyfriend to join in.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Becky hated her first class and asked her boyfriend to join in.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Becky's boyfriend agreed to join the cooking class because Becky asked him to after she had a negative experience in her first class. If Becky had not cooked good food, it may have motivated her to take a cooking class, but it does not necessarily mean her boyfriend would also want to join."}}
{"Q": "I read Far from the Madding Crowd in 2006. Which event could cause My son is converting it to mp3?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John, my son decided he wanted to read the book. (B) I hated Far from the Maddening crowd so much, I told my son about it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John, my son decided he wanted to read the book.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the son wanted to read the book and decided to convert it to mp3 for convenience or to listen to it on the go. It is less likely that the mother's negative opinion of the book would inspire the son to convert it to mp3."}}
{"Q": "Cornelia had always loved working with her hands. Which event could cause Cornelia uses it as a nightstand in her room?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cornelia re-built an old, broken table. (B) Cornelia decided to make a blanket with the yarn scraps in her garage.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Re-building an old, broken table would require Cornelia to use her hands and skills to fix it up. This event would showcase Cornelia's love for working with her hands and could potentially lead her to repurpose the table as a nightstand in her room. Making a blanket with yarn scraps, while also a hands-on activity, does not necessarily relate to using a piece of furniture as a nightstand."}}
{"Q": "Tim wanted to drive badly. Which event could cause He passed it on the very first try?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim took his algebra test. (B) He took his test.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He took his test.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions Tim's desire to drive badly, which implies that he was preparing for a driving test. Therefore, passing the test on the first try would be a plausible event that could cause his excitement to drive. Option (A) about Tim's algebra test is unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Sam loved breakfast. Which event could cause Sam ate three waffles this morning?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Breakfast ate a lot at Sam. (B) Sam found his favorite waffles in the freezer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sam found his favorite waffles in the freezer.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it provides a specific reason for why Sam ate three waffles - he found his favorite waffles in the freezer. Option (A) is not a logical reason for why Sam ate three waffles, as it suggests that breakfast itself ate a lot at Sam, which doesn't make sense."}}
{"Q": "I wanted a pet for my birthday. Which event could cause I brought a dog home since I have so many dogs already?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) So I went to the Dollar Store. (B) So I went to the Dog Pound.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. So I went to the Dog Pound.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that someone would bring home a dog from the dog pound if they were looking for a pet, rather than going to the Dollar Store. Additionally, if the person already has many dogs, it is possible that they have a soft spot for rescuing animals and may have gone to the dog pound specifically to adopt a new furry friend."}}
{"Q": "Louisa loved roller coasters. Which event could cause She beat the game in a day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Louisa bought roller coaster tycoon. (B) Louisa played the line coaster simulator.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Louisa bought roller coaster tycoon.\nExplanation: Roller coaster tycoon is a popular simulation game where players can design and manage their own amusement parks, including building and operating roller coasters. It is more likely that Louisa beat the game in a day by playing roller coaster tycoon, as it is a game that requires strategy and planning, and can be completed in a relatively short amount of time. Playing a line coaster simulator may be fun, but it is unlikely to result in \"beating the game\" as it is not a game with a clear objective or end goal."}}
{"Q": "Candice loves tacos. Which event could cause Candice got better at making tacos?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Candace could learn how to make tacos. (B) Candace studied the art of taco making.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Candace could learn how to make tacos.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Candice would get better at making tacos if she learned how to make them, rather than just studying the art of taco making. Learning how to make tacos would involve hands-on experience and practice, which would likely lead to improvement in her taco-making skills. Studying the art of taco making may provide some helpful tips and knowledge, but it would not necessarily translate to actual improvement in her ability to make tacos."}}
{"Q": "Tammy was excited that her family was moving to a new home. Which event could cause When they arrived at their new place Tammy loved it and wasn't scared?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tammy was also afraid. (B) Tammy heard the new house had burned down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Tammy was also afraid.\nExplanation: It is common for children to feel anxious or scared when moving to a new home, especially if it is their first time. Therefore, it is plausible that Tammy could have been afraid initially. However, as she explored and got familiar with the new place, she could have overcome her fear and started to love it. On the other hand, option (B) is highly unlikely as hearing that the new house had burned down would cause panic and fear, not excitement or love."}}
{"Q": "My friends bought me a gift. Which event could cause I learned to be more careful with knives?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I used a knife to open the gift but ended down cutting myself. (B) It was knives, and I accidentally cut myself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person cut themselves while using a knife to open the gift, as this is a common scenario where people may not be paying close attention to their actions and accidentally injure themselves. Option B is also possible, but it is less likely as it does not provide any specific context or reason for why the person would be handling knives in the first place."}}
{"Q": "I got up from a nap feeling very hungry. Which event could cause After the inspector arrived and killed the rats, I felt very happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I decided not to eat when I saw a rat in the kitchen. (B) I ate a lot of rats in my kitchen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: The event of the inspector arriving and killing the rats would not have any direct impact on the narrator's hunger. However, seeing a rat in the kitchen could potentially cause them to lose their appetite and decide not to eat. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer. Option (B) is not a realistic scenario as it is highly unlikely that someone would eat rats found in their kitchen."}}
{"Q": "John found a wallet on the street with $180 in it. Which event could cause He gave him half the money that was in the wallet?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He couldn't believe his modesty. (B) John, returned the wallet to the owner and was rewarded.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) John, returned the wallet to the owner and was rewarded.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John returned the wallet to the owner and was rewarded with half the money as a token of appreciation. It is unlikely that John would give away half the money just because he was impressed by someone's modesty."}}
{"Q": "Sean was playing with his guitar one night. Which event could cause No one knocked again but he was certain that it was a noise complaint?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) someone knocked on his wall. (B) The police showed up knocking on his door.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The police showed up knocking on his door.\nExplanation: If someone knocked on his wall, it would not necessarily lead to Sean assuming it was a noise complaint. However, if the police showed up knocking on his door, it would be a more plausible reason for Sean to assume it was a noise complaint. The police are often called for noise complaints, and their presence would indicate that someone had made a complaint about the noise level."}}
{"Q": "John loved to paint in the park. Which event could cause John was flattered and agreed to doing the mural?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A business owner replied him to do a mural. (B) john was hired to paint something for someone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a business owner approached John and asked him to do a mural, which would be a flattering offer and could lead to more opportunities for John as an artist. Being hired to paint something for someone is a more general statement and does not necessarily imply that John was specifically asked to do a mural, which is the focus of the question."}}
{"Q": "Mary gave her dog Max a bone for Christmas. Which event could cause She gave it back to Max who wagged his tail happily?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Max could not find it so she looked for the bone for him. (B) Mary got an extra anti-cartilage.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Mary found the bone and gave it back to Max, which would make him wag his tail happily. Option B, on the other hand, is not related to Max getting his bone back and does not explain why he would wag his tail happily."}}
{"Q": "Kiki was a brand new mother. Which event could cause Kiki and her baby were much happier with her decision?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kiki decided to go back to work. (B) Kiki decided to work from home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kiki decided to work from home.\nExplanation: Being a new mother can be overwhelming and stressful, and being away from the baby for long periods of time can cause anxiety and guilt. By choosing to work from home, Kiki can be close to her baby and attend to their needs while still being able to work and earn an income. This can lead to a happier and more fulfilling experience for both Kiki and her baby. On the other hand, if Kiki decided to go back to work, she may have to leave her baby with a caregiver or at a daycare, which can cause stress and anxiety for both Kiki and her baby."}}
{"Q": "Luke was entered into a pie eating contest. Which event could cause Luke didn't care to win, he was just happy to eat free pie?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Luke loved pie and was not that competitive. (B) Luke's stomach turned thinking about pie.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Luke loved pie and was not that competitive.\nExplanation: If Luke loved pie, it is plausible that he would be more interested in eating the pie than winning the contest. Additionally, if he is not that competitive, he may not feel the need to win and would be content with just enjoying the free pie. On the other hand, if his stomach turned thinking about pie (option B), it is unlikely that he would even enter a pie eating contest in the first place."}}
{"Q": "It was the day Amy's new furniture was being delivered. Which event could cause Just then the truck pulled up with the furniture?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was getting anxious and thinking about calling the police. (B) Amy stayed at home for the furniture to arrive.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Amy stayed at home for the furniture to arrive.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Amy was waiting at home for the furniture to arrive, rather than getting anxious and thinking about calling the police. The fact that the truck pulled up just then suggests that Amy was expecting the delivery and had made arrangements to be at home for it."}}
{"Q": "Alan got a gun for his 18th birthday. Which event could cause He then went to sleep?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He put it by his bicycle. (B) He shot at paper targets all day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He put it by his bicycle.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that after receiving a gun as a gift, Alan would handle it responsibly and store it safely before going to sleep. Putting it by his bicycle suggests that he may have secured it in a designated area, rather than leaving it out in the open or using it for recreational purposes like shooting at paper targets."}}
{"Q": "My friends decided to go to Boomers. Which event could cause Although the arcade closed early, we had a good time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The video games were all out of order, but everything else was open. (B) Boomers doesn't have any of the games we like to play.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If the arcade closed early, it could have been disappointing if the only reason for going to Boomers was to play video games. However, if everything else was open and the group still had a good time playing mini-golf, go-karting, or other attractions, it would make sense to say \"Although the arcade closed early, we had a good time.\" Option (B) doesn't make sense because if Boomers didn't have any of the games the group likes to play, it's unlikely they would have had a good time at all."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy was walking home from school. Which event could cause When Jimmy got home, his mother let him keep the dog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jimmy found a dog who had no collar on. (B) Jimmy repelled a stray dog who attacked him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jimmy found a dog who had no collar on.\nExplanation: If Jimmy found a dog who had no collar on, it is possible that the dog was a stray and had no owner. Jimmy could have taken the dog home and his mother may have allowed him to keep it as a pet. On the other hand, if Jimmy repelled a stray dog who attacked him, it is unlikely that his mother would let him keep the dog as it could be dangerous and not suitable as a pet."}}
{"Q": "Tom wanted to learn to bowl. Which event could cause He did so well, he won second prize?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A bowling competition entered Tom. (B) He hired a coach before the bowling tournament.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A bowling competition entered Tom.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom won second prize in a bowling competition he entered, rather than hiring a coach before a tournament. Hiring a coach may have helped him improve his skills, but it does not guarantee that he would win a prize in a tournament. On the other hand, participating in a competition gives Tom the opportunity to showcase his skills and compete against other bowlers, increasing his chances of winning a prize."}}
{"Q": "Charles still calls the party-line to meet girls. Which event could cause The girl was a blond supermodel washing cars in a wet t-shirt?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A girl picked up the party line. (B) He wanted one of them to be his brother.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If a girl picked up the party line, there is a chance that Charles could meet her and potentially find out that she is a blond supermodel washing cars in a wet t-shirt. This event is more plausible than him wanting one of the girls to be his brother, which does not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "I turned off my computer and picked up a notebook. Which event could cause I spent most of the time staring at the blacked-out screen?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I started browsing random websites. (B) I don't know what to write.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I don't know what to write.\nExplanation: If the person picked up a notebook to write something, it is likely that they are experiencing writer's block or are unsure of what to write about. This could cause them to stare at the blank screen for a prolonged period of time, trying to come up with ideas or inspiration. Browsing random websites would not necessarily cause them to stare at the blacked-out screen for a long time, as they would likely be engaged in the content on the websites."}}
{"Q": "Nina had an asthma attack in school one day. Which event could cause Luckily, another girl had had an inhaler in her purse?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nina, panicked as she realized her inhaler had asmtha. (B) When she rummaged through her backpack she realized she did not bring it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) When she rummaged through her backpack she realized she did not bring it.\n\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is common for people to forget important items like inhalers when they are in a rush or distracted. It is also more likely that Nina would panic after realizing she did not have her inhaler, rather than already knowing she did not have it and then panicking. Additionally, it is more realistic for another student to have an inhaler in their purse than for Nina to suddenly remember she had left hers at home."}}
{"Q": "My boss asked me to find the mean value of a data set. Which event could cause He thanked me for my brilliant insight into the problem?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I gave my boss the answer quickly. (B) My boss gave me the answer quickly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I gave my boss the answer quickly.\nExplanation: If the employee was able to quickly and accurately provide the mean value of the data set, it would demonstrate their competence and knowledge in the field. This could lead to the boss thanking them for their insight and expertise. On the other hand, if the boss gave the answer quickly, it would not necessarily reflect positively on the employee's abilities or contribution to the task."}}
{"Q": "Leo was throwing a huge party, the invitations were in the mail. Which event could cause However, Leo never put stamps on the invites and no one came?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Leo was excited for the party. (B) No one ended up coming to the zoo.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) No one ended up coming to the zoo.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is directly related to the situation of the invitations not being delivered. If Leo had forgotten to put stamps on the invitations, then they would not have been delivered to the guests. Therefore, it is more likely that no one came to the party because they never received the invitations, rather than Leo being excited for the party. The second option, about no one coming to the zoo, is not related to the situation and does not provide a logical explanation for why no one came to Leo's party."}}
{"Q": "Noah was playing in his treehouse. Which event could cause He was so glad?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Noah saw his friend coming towards his house. (B) Noah had fun with his friends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Noah saw his friend coming towards his house.\nExplanation: Seeing his friend coming towards his house would likely make Noah glad because he would have someone to play with and share his treehouse with. It would also provide him with social interaction and the opportunity to have fun with a friend. While having fun with his friends (option B) could also make him glad, it is not specific enough to the situation described in the question."}}
{"Q": "Rupert worked as a program leader keeping track of schedules. Which event could cause Rupert is glad that he is so close to retirement?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rupert hates his job. (B) Rupert loves his job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rupert hates his job.\n\nExplanation: If Rupert hates his job, then any event that causes him stress or frustration would make him glad that he is close to retirement. For example, if there is a major scheduling conflict or if he is dealing with difficult team members, he may feel relieved that he won't have to deal with these issues for much longer. On the other hand, if Rupert loves his job, he may be sad to retire and may not be looking forward to leaving his role as a program leader."}}
{"Q": "Adam fell asleep at a sleepover. Which event could cause Adam was so embarrassed he blushed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Adam woke up with drawings on his face. (B) Adam woke up to all his friends talking to him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Adam woke up with drawings on his face.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Adam would be embarrassed and blush if he woke up with drawings on his face, especially if they were inappropriate or embarrassing. Waking up to friends talking to him may not necessarily be embarrassing, depending on the context of the conversation."}}
{"Q": "Jill's two cats had kittens in the same week. Which event could cause Jill gave them to the other cat, who looked grateful?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jill decided she had too many credit cards. (B) One of Jill's cats had way more than the other.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that one of Jill's cats had more kittens than the other, causing Jill to give some of them to the other cat who may have had fewer kittens or none at all. It is unlikely that Jill's decision to have too many credit cards would have any relation to her cats having kittens."}}
{"Q": "Rob hated the second grade. Which event could cause They decided to homeschool him for the rest of the year?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rob was having a hard time adjusting. (B) Rob talked to his dog.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rob was having a hard time adjusting.\nExplanation: If Rob was having a hard time adjusting to the second grade, it could have resulted in poor academic performance, behavioral issues, or emotional distress. Homeschooling could be seen as a solution to provide a more personalized and supportive learning environment for Rob. On the other hand, talking to his dog, as in option B, is not a convincing reason for homeschooling and seems unrelated to academic or social challenges."}}
{"Q": "Joy was jealous when she didn't get an invitation to a sleep-over. Which event could cause But Joy's mom heard of the infestation and made her clean the house?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joy's house was a sad place to be. (B) The sleep over was canceled after lice was found.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The sleep over was canceled after lice was found.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly relates to the reason why Joy was jealous in the first place - not being invited to the sleepover. Additionally, the infestation of lice would be a valid reason for the sleepover to be canceled, and Joy's mom making her clean the house would be a logical response to prevent any potential spread of the infestation. On the other hand, choice (A) about Joy's house being a sad place to be is not directly related to the situation and does not provide a clear reason for why Joy's mom would make her clean the house."}}
{"Q": "Curt worked for Lu's grandfather in a deli in Selma, Indiana. Which event could cause Lu and Curt got married and moved to Selma, Alabama?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lu would visit Kurt everyday at lunch. (B) Curt was dating Lu, but they broke up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Lu would visit Curt everyday at lunch.\nExplanation: If Lu visited Curt everyday at lunch, it is possible that they developed a closer relationship and eventually got married. This scenario suggests that they spent more time together and got to know each other better, which could lead to a romantic relationship. On the other hand, option (B) suggests that they broke up, which would make it less likely for them to get married and move to a new location together. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Clay plays baseball for a living. Which event could cause Clay cannot pitch the rest of the season due to his injury?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) he ended up breaking his arm. (B) Clay injured his refuse in a game.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Breaking his arm would be a more plausible reason for Clay to not be able to pitch for the rest of the season as it is a serious injury that would require a significant amount of time to heal. In contrast, injuring his refuse (which is not a commonly known body part) may not be severe enough to prevent him from pitching for the entire season."}}
{"Q": "Carl had three kids and a wife. Which event could cause It only took Carl 20 minutes to remember how much he hates his life?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Carl went on vacation. (B) Carl had some time alone when his dog was away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Carl had some time alone when his dog was away.\n\nExplanation: Having three kids and a wife can be overwhelming and stressful at times. It is possible that Carl was feeling burnt out and needed some time alone to recharge. When his dog was away, he may have had some much-needed peace and quiet, which allowed him to reflect on his life and feel unhappy with his current situation. This scenario is more plausible than Carl going on vacation, as vacations are typically associated with relaxation and enjoyment, rather than negative feelings."}}
{"Q": "Molly turned 5 Year's old today. Which event could cause This was her best birthday so far?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Molly bought her parents a kitten for her birthday. (B) Parents hired magicians for his birthday party.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Parents hired magicians for his birthday party.\nExplanation: Hiring magicians for her birthday party would be a more plausible reason for Molly to consider it her best birthday so far. As a 5-year-old, she would likely enjoy the entertainment and excitement of a magic show, which would make her birthday party more memorable and enjoyable. While buying her parents a kitten would be a kind gesture, it may not necessarily make her own birthday the best one yet."}}
{"Q": "Hank was looking for a new religion. Which event could cause Hank ended up joining this new religion?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The old religion was very wild. (B) The new religion was very peaceful.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The new religion was very peaceful.\nExplanation: If Hank was looking for a new religion, it is likely that he was dissatisfied with his current religion. If the old religion was very wild, it may have turned Hank off from religion altogether, rather than leading him to seek out a new one. On the other hand, if the new religion was very peaceful, it may have appealed to Hank's desire for a more calming and positive spiritual experience. Therefore, it is more plausible that Hank would join a new religion because it was peaceful, rather than because his old religion was wild."}}
{"Q": "Amy and Kim stayed over Lynn's house. Which event could cause Lynn ended up convincing her to break curfew and sneak out again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Katies parents were not okay with her being out that late. (B) Lynn had gotten in trouble last time for sneaking out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: If Katie's parents were not okay with her being out that late, it would not necessarily affect Lynn's decision to break curfew and sneak out again. However, if Lynn had gotten in trouble last time for sneaking out, she would be less likely to do it again, making option B less plausible. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Lynn may have been influenced by external factors such as peer pressure or a desire to have fun with her friends."}}
{"Q": "Eli didn't know much about using Microsoft Access. Which event could cause Eli easily updated the column's values?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Eli checked for Access examples online. (B) Eli watched an online tutorial to find out how to copy values in a column.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Watching an online tutorial to find out how to copy values in a column would be a more plausible event to help Eli easily update the column's values. This is because tutorials provide step-by-step instructions and visual aids that can help someone who is new to a software program like Microsoft Access. Checking for Access examples online may provide some guidance, but it may not be as helpful as a tutorial that specifically addresses the task at hand."}}
{"Q": "While out on a hike gloria ran into a snake. Which event could cause She kept her eyes open for more snakes on the trail?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was became convinced that this was the only snake there. (B) she started to walk in the opposite direction.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) She became convinced that this was the only snake there.\nExplanation: If Gloria ran into a snake while hiking, it is likely that she would become more cautious and aware of her surroundings. If she saw one snake, she would be more likely to keep her eyes open for more snakes on the trail, rather than simply walking in the opposite direction. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ben spent hours putting up Christmas lights. Which event could cause After resetting the breaker, the lights came back on?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben finally finished and plugged them in and the electric went out. (B) He like easter lights.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ben finally finished and plugged them in and the electric went out.\n\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because it suggests that the Christmas lights caused an overload on the circuit, which tripped the breaker and caused the power outage. After resetting the breaker, the lights came back on, indicating that the issue was resolved. In contrast, option B about liking Easter lights is not relevant to the situation and does not provide a logical explanation for why the lights went out and then came back on."}}
{"Q": "My grandmother and I used to go to the park for picnics. Which event could cause The important part was just spending time with her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My grandmothers sandwiches were awful, but I didn't mind. (B) My grandmothers temper was awful.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The fact that the sandwiches were not good but the narrator didn't mind suggests that the quality of the food was not the important part of the picnics. Instead, it was the time spent with the grandmother that was valuable to the narrator."}}
{"Q": "Greg went to the park hoping to play a game of basketball. Which event could cause Greg was relieved that he was going to get to play?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Greg forgot his ball and asked some people to play. (B) Greg was the lead actor in the play.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Greg forgot his ball and asked some people to play.\nExplanation: If Greg forgot his ball, he would need to ask other people at the park if he could join their game or if they wanted to play with him. If someone agreed to play with him, he would be relieved that he could still play basketball even though he forgot his ball. On the other hand, being the lead actor in a play has nothing to do with playing basketball at the park, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I was in Fourth grade. Which event could cause I was the spelling bee champion?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) After minutes of practice, I was ready to compete in the fourth grade spelling bee. (B) I got asked to be in the spelling bee.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. After minutes of practice, I was ready to compete in the fourth grade spelling bee.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the student became the spelling bee champion after practicing and preparing for the competition, rather than simply being asked to participate without any prior preparation. Hard work and dedication are often necessary to achieve success in competitions like spelling bees."}}
{"Q": "Mel got a summer job at the ice cream parlor. Which event could cause Mel suddenly loved her summer job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mel got a small bonus one day. (B) Mel was afraid to start a job but made some new friends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mel got a small bonus one day.\nExplanation: Getting a small bonus can be a motivating factor for anyone, especially for someone who is new to a job. It can make them feel appreciated and valued, which can lead to a sudden love for the job. On the other hand, making new friends is a positive experience, but it may not necessarily make someone love their job. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My partner realized she is depressed this year. Which event could cause The struggle made her a stronger person?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My partner overcame her depression. (B) She began to see a doctor to help her with her heartburn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My partner overcame her depression.\nExplanation: Overcoming depression is a significant accomplishment that requires a lot of strength and resilience. It involves seeking help, making lifestyle changes, and working through difficult emotions. Going through this struggle and coming out on the other side can make a person feel stronger and more capable of handling future challenges. On the other hand, seeing a doctor for heartburn, while important for one's health, is not likely to have the same transformative effect on a person's mental and emotional well-being."}}
{"Q": "Jay was working at his job, a restaurant. Which event could cause Jay had to give it to her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) But Jay owe money to his sister for a package. (B) A guy came in to pick up his order.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If Jay owes money to his sister for a package, it is possible that he may need to give his paycheck to her to pay off the debt. However, if a guy came in to pick up his order, it is unlikely that this event would cause Jay to give his paycheck to someone else."}}
{"Q": "Patsy was in charge of lining up people to work at a football game. Which event could cause Another group had to bring more to help out so that we had enough?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Patsy did not have enough resources. (B) She realized there weren't enough hot dogs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Patsy did not have enough resources.\nExplanation: If Patsy did not have enough resources, such as enough volunteers or staff, then it would make sense that another group had to bring more to help out. However, if Patsy realized there weren't enough hot dogs, that would not necessarily require another group to bring more help. It would simply require ordering more hot dogs or finding an alternative food option."}}
{"Q": "Jeremy's mother didn't approve of his lifestyle. Which event could cause Jeremy had to move back in with his mother?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) he went to go live with his father. (B) Jeremy lost his job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jeremy lost his job.\nExplanation: If Jeremy lost his job, he may not be able to afford his current living situation and may have to move back in with his mother. This is a more plausible answer than him choosing to go live with his father, as it is not stated whether his father is an option or if he has a good relationship with him."}}
{"Q": "Ray loved to go hiking. Which event could cause Ray was able to hike again with the help of the brace?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) but during a recent trip he broke his leg becouse he did not bring the proper equipment becouse he thought he was a pro. (B) Ray hurt his leg and couldn't afford to get a brace put on.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Ray broke his leg due to his own negligence and lack of preparation, rather than an external factor like financial constraints. Additionally, the fact that he was able to hike again with the help of a brace implies that his injury was not too severe, and that he was able to recover relatively quickly."}}
{"Q": "Ben and Pam have been arguing a lot lately. Which event could cause Ben and Pam are a lot happier and are still married?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben and Pam went to couples therapy, and learned that they were not understanding each other. (B) They decided to go their separate ways.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Going to couples therapy and learning how to better understand each other is a more plausible solution for Ben and Pam to become happier and stay married. It shows that they are willing to work on their issues and improve their communication, rather than giving up and going their separate ways. Therapy can provide them with the tools and skills needed to strengthen their relationship and resolve conflicts in a healthy way."}}
{"Q": "The hikers suddenly stopped in their tracks. Which event could cause The hikers turned into sprinters, likely setting a record or two?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The hikers stumbled on a tree branch. (B) The hikers stumbled on a bear and her cubs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The hikers stumbled on a bear and her cubs.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because encountering a bear and her cubs can be a dangerous situation that would cause the hikers to run for safety. Stumbling on a tree branch may cause a stumble or fall, but it is unlikely to cause the hikers to suddenly turn into sprinters setting records."}}
{"Q": "I needed to get a Christmas present for my father. Which event could cause When he opened his present, he said it was his best gift this year?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I decided to get him a tool he wanted. (B) I bought him a new pizza.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a tool he wanted would be a better gift for him than a new pizza. A tool would be a more practical and useful gift, especially if it was something he had been wanting for a while. A new pizza, while enjoyable, would not likely be the best gift he received all year."}}
{"Q": "Kenny was lost on the streets. Which event could cause The driver ended up finding it and dropped him off?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kenny lost his wedding ring in the taxi. (B) He didn't know where he wanted to go.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: If Kenny lost his wedding ring in the taxi, he may have contacted the taxi company or reported it to the police. The driver may have found the ring and recognized Kenny's name or description, leading him to search for Kenny and eventually finding him. On the other hand, if Kenny didn't know where he wanted to go, it's unlikely that the driver would have been able to help him find his way back."}}
{"Q": "Lenny wanted to watch a movie. Which event could cause When he got home, he prepared to return his three movies?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lenny picked out three movies but he'd forgotten his wallet. (B) Lenny's friends invited him to come over.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lenny picked out three movies but he'd forgotten his wallet.\nExplanation: If Lenny forgot his wallet, he wouldn't be able to rent any movies. Therefore, he would have to return the three movies he already had. This event is more plausible than option B, where Lenny's friends inviting him over has no direct connection to him returning his movies."}}
{"Q": "Hank walked on his deck towards his back door. Which event could cause Got his power drill and drilled the board back in place?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A board from Hank's deck broke off as he walked on it. (B) Hank did not notice a baseboard on the deck was loose.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: If a board from Hank's deck broke off as he walked on it, it would be a logical reason for the board to be loose and require drilling back in place. On the other hand, if Hank did not notice a baseboard on the deck was loose, it would be unlikely for him to suddenly grab his power drill and fix it without first noticing the issue. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ben had an interview for a promising job. Which event could cause Ben aced his interview and got the job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben learned a lot about the company before his interview so that he would appear keen. (B) Ben prepared the night before with many shots.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Learning about the company before an interview shows that Ben is interested in the job and has done his research. This would make him appear more prepared and knowledgeable during the interview, increasing his chances of acing it and getting the job. On the other hand, preparing for an interview with shots is not a professional or effective way to prepare and could actually harm Ben's chances of getting the job."}}
{"Q": "I read Remembrance of Things Past in 2008. Which event could cause I was happy to have read such a long work?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I felt triumphant as I read the first page. (B) It recently came up in a game of trivia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It recently came up in a game of trivia.\nExplanation: It is unlikely that feeling triumphant after reading the first page would sustain the reader's motivation to finish such a long work. On the other hand, if the book recently came up in a game of trivia, the reader may have felt a sense of pride and accomplishment for having read it, which could have caused them to be happy about their decision to read the book in 2008."}}
{"Q": "We had a lot of mice in 2011. Which event could cause I killed several mice that way?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) One way we got rid of them was with the use of a BB gun. (B) We decided to get raccoon traps.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. One way we got rid of them was with the use of a BB gun.\nExplanation: While using a BB gun to kill mice may not be the most humane method, it is a plausible way to get rid of them. On the other hand, using raccoon traps to catch mice is not a practical solution as raccoon traps are designed to catch larger animals like raccoons, not mice."}}
{"Q": "My sister is going to have a baby. Which event could cause It's a girl?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My sister wished for a girl. (B) She went to get a mammogram.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My sister wished for a girl.\nExplanation: The sex of a baby is determined by the chromosomes from the father's sperm and the mother's egg. While there are some methods that claim to influence the sex of a baby, such as timing intercourse or altering the mother's diet, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Therefore, it is not possible for a mammogram to determine the sex of a baby. However, it is possible for the parents to conceive a girl if the father's sperm carries an X chromosome and fertilizes the mother's egg that also carries an X chromosome. So, if your sister wished for a girl and conceives a baby with two X chromosomes, it is more likely to be a girl."}}
{"Q": "There once was a princess who tried to write a story. Which event could cause Then the prince and the princess lived happily ever after?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The princess never met a prince and fell in love. (B) She sat and wrote a novel that was read around the world.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The princess never met a prince and fell in love.\nExplanation: The phrase \"Then the prince and the princess lived happily ever after\" is commonly used in fairy tales to indicate a happy ending where the main characters fall in love and get married. In this scenario, if the princess never met a prince and fell in love, it would be unlikely for the story to end with them living happily ever after together. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Diana order a set of pregnancy tests. Which event could cause She was in tears since the results were positive?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Diana was suddenly sleepy. (B) Diana isn't ready to have a kid.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Diana isn't ready to have a kid.\nExplanation: The fact that Diana was in tears after receiving positive results from the pregnancy test suggests that she was not prepared or ready to have a child. This emotional response is common among individuals who may not have planned for or anticipated a pregnancy. Option (A) about being suddenly sleepy does not seem to be related to the situation and is not a plausible explanation for Diana's emotional response."}}
{"Q": "While I was in Hawaii, I was able to golf at Kapalua. Which event could cause I had one of my best rounds and best experiences golfing there?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather was perfect and the course is away from the tourists part of the island. (B) I got a hole in seven.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The weather and location of the course are more likely to have a significant impact on the overall experience and quality of the round than getting a single hole in seven. Additionally, being away from the tourist areas may have allowed for a more peaceful and enjoyable round."}}
{"Q": "Rob tried to be patient as he waiting in line. Which event could cause When his turn was up he got right back in line?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rob left the line and went home. (B) He slid down the slide.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Rob left the line and went home.\n\nExplanation: If Rob got tired of waiting and decided to leave, he wouldn't get back in line. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Rob remained in the area and continued to wait in line. Option (B) is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the situation and does not explain why Rob would get back in line."}}
{"Q": "I felt out of shape. Which event could cause I was happy when I made it to the top?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I decided to climb down the hill anyway. (B) I was doing diet and exercise for a while.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If the person was doing diet and exercise for a while, it is more likely that they were able to climb to the top of a hill without feeling out of breath or exhausted. This would make them happy and proud of their progress in getting back into shape. Climbing down the hill anyway (option A) does not necessarily indicate that the person was happy about it, and it does not necessarily address the issue of feeling out of shape."}}
{"Q": "Amy was sitting on a swing at Lynn's house. Which event could cause She realized at 14, they were getting too old for swing sets?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The swing was too small for her to get on it. (B) The swingset chain nearly broke.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The swing was too small for her to get on it.\nExplanation: As Amy grew older, she would have naturally grown taller and bigger, making it difficult for her to fit on a small swing meant for younger children. This realization would have made her feel too old for swing sets. On the other hand, the swingset chain nearly breaking would not necessarily make her feel too old for swing sets, but rather scared or unsafe on the swing."}}
{"Q": "Gina returned to her bedroom ready to work on her report. Which event could cause Instead she talked on the phone for 2 hours?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina turned off her phone when a friend called. (B) Gina's best friend called her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Gina's best friend called her.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gina's best friend called her and they ended up talking for 2 hours, causing her to get sidetracked from working on her report. It is less likely that Gina would turn off her phone when a friend called, as this would be considered rude and unlikely behavior."}}
{"Q": "Carey walked her dog in the dog park every day. Which event could cause Now Carey walks 9 dogs in the dog park every day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Carey put flyers out to offer to walk other dogs. (B) One day someone hired her to eat their dog.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Carey put flyers out to offer to walk other dogs.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because Carey actively sought out additional dogs to walk by putting flyers out. It is unlikely that someone would hire her to eat their dog, as that is illegal and morally reprehensible. Additionally, it is unlikely that Carey would suddenly acquire 9 dogs to walk every day without actively seeking out additional clients."}}
{"Q": "Lucy was waiting for a delivery from Schwan's. Which event could cause Grandma had ordered her favorite ice cream just for Lucy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy was expecting to fast like her Grandma. (B) Lucy was given ice cream.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lucy was given ice cream.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Grandma ordered Lucy's favorite ice cream because she knew Lucy was waiting for a delivery from Schwan's and wanted to surprise her with a treat. Option (A) does not make sense in this context as it is not related to the delivery or Grandma's actions."}}
{"Q": "Once, there was a very fat man. Which event could cause They tried to bury him, but he was too fat for the coffin?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He lost so much weight he died. (B) He passed away from his heart being overburdened.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He passed away from his heart being overburdened.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man passed away due to his weight causing strain on his heart, rather than losing so much weight that he died. Obesity can lead to various health issues, including heart disease, which can ultimately result in death. Therefore, it is possible that the man's weight caused his heart to fail, making it difficult to fit him into a standard-sized coffin."}}
{"Q": "Rufus has wanted to see his son Jonathan for several months. Which event could cause Rufus feels great that he finally got to see his son?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) rufus made a special trip. (B) Rufus made the trek to see his son, and his son was happy to see him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rufus would feel great about finally seeing his son if his son was happy to see him as well. Making a special trip alone may not necessarily guarantee a positive outcome or emotional satisfaction for Rufus."}}
{"Q": "Priya decided to try a new restaurant. Which event could cause Priya decided not to eat and left?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Priya saw a rat run across the floor. (B) Fortunately, the service was great and the food looked delicious.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Priya saw a rat run across the floor.\nExplanation: Seeing a rat in a restaurant is a health hazard and can be a major turn off for customers. It is a plausible reason for Priya to decide not to eat and leave the restaurant. On the other hand, good service and delicious-looking food would likely encourage Priya to stay and enjoy her meal."}}
{"Q": "Will wanted to quit smoking. Which event could cause He finally quit smoking?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Will ceased buying cigarettes at the store. (B) Will kept buying cigarettes at the store.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Will ceased buying cigarettes at the store.\nExplanation: If Will stops buying cigarettes at the store, he will not have access to cigarettes and will be forced to quit smoking. This is a more plausible answer because it removes the temptation and access to cigarettes, making it easier for Will to quit smoking. On the other hand, if Will keeps buying cigarettes at the store, he will continue to smoke and will not be able to quit."}}
{"Q": "I once went on an ice skating date with someone. Which event could cause He laughed and suggested we do something else?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was a great skater. (B) We both were terrible and fell a lot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) We both were terrible and fell a lot.\nExplanation: If both individuals were terrible at ice skating and kept falling, it could have caused frustration and discomfort, leading to the suggestion of doing something else. Laughing could have been a way to ease the tension and suggest a change of activity. On the other hand, if he was a great skater, he could have offered to teach and help the other person, making the experience more enjoyable."}}
{"Q": "Tess and Jane took the vow. Which event could cause They hugged each other and went outside to play?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tess and Jane decided to play very carefully. (B) They agreed that they were done playing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Tess and Jane decided to play very carefully.\n\nExplanation: Since Tess and Jane took a vow, it is likely that they were engaged in some kind of serious activity or event. Therefore, it is more plausible that they hugged each other and went outside to play carefully, rather than suddenly agreeing that they were done playing altogether. The act of hugging each other suggests that they were happy or relieved about something, which could have been the decision to play carefully."}}
{"Q": "I was playing guitar in my room. Which event could cause I grabbed a replacement string and went back to playing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I broke a finger. (B) In my enthusiasm, I broke one of the strings.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) In my enthusiasm, I broke one of the strings.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a guitar string would break due to enthusiastic playing rather than breaking a finger while playing. Additionally, it is common for guitarists to have replacement strings on hand for when this happens, making it a more plausible scenario."}}
{"Q": "Bill's ambition was to be a lawyer. Which event could cause After winning money from his lawsuit, he no longer needed a job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bill went to law school to be a lawyer. (B) Bill went to law school to be a bailiff.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Bill went to law school to be a lawyer.\nExplanation: If Bill's ambition was to be a lawyer, it is more plausible that winning money from his lawsuit would allow him to pursue his ambition by going to law school and becoming a lawyer. It is unlikely that winning money from a lawsuit would lead him to become a bailiff, which is a different career path. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Terry got drunk with his friends in the daytime. Which event could cause Terry stopped being friends with them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terry got caught screwing up at school because he was drunk. (B) Terry's friends thought Terry was an alcoholic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Getting caught screwing up at school because of being drunk is a more plausible reason for Terry to stop being friends with his drinking buddies. This event could have serious consequences for Terry's future and could make him realize that his friends' behavior is not worth risking his education and future opportunities. On the other hand, Terry's friends thinking he is an alcoholic may not necessarily be true and could be based on their own biases or misunderstandings."}}
{"Q": "I always hate PE. Which event could cause I tripped and ended up knocking three teeth out, I hate PE?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was spontaneoused to take PE anyway. (B) The coach made me run the track.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the physical activity of running on the track, which may have been difficult or uncomfortable for the individual, caused them to trip and knock out their teeth. Being spontaneously forced to take PE anyway may not necessarily lead to a specific accident like this."}}
{"Q": "Dave loved the outdoors. Which event could cause Dave backed away slowly?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When Dave went on a hike, he spotted a wild wolf. (B) Dave encountered the outdoors.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: While Dave loved the outdoors, encountering a wild wolf could be a potentially dangerous situation. It would be natural for him to back away slowly to avoid provoking the animal."}}
{"Q": "Sean posted an ad for guitar lessons online. Which event could cause When he was done, they paid him and he went home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sean got his first client, but when he went to their house to teach, they weren't home. (B) A local organization saw his ad out there and hired him for some group lessons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it states that a local organization saw Sean's ad and hired him for group lessons. This means that Sean had a successful lesson with the organization, and they paid him before he went home. Option A is less likely because it suggests that Sean's first client did not show up, so he did not have a lesson and did not get paid."}}
{"Q": "Sally was driving late at night. Which event could cause The homeowner was speechless?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sally fell asleep and hit a car. (B) Sally fell asleep and drive into a neighbor's house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Sally driving into a neighbor's house would be a more plausible event that could cause the homeowner to be speechless. This is because it is a more unexpected and dramatic event than simply hitting a car. Additionally, the fact that it happened late at night could add to the shock and surprise of the situation."}}
{"Q": "Jake just moved into his new house. Which event could cause Zach regrets moving to this neighborhood?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jake's roommate Zach loves the local community. (B) There is a lot of gang members and noise outside.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If there are a lot of gang members and noise outside, it could make Zach regret moving to the neighborhood due to safety concerns and disturbance. On the other hand, Jake's roommate loving the local community may not necessarily have a negative impact on Zach's decision to move to the neighborhood."}}
{"Q": "Lily desperately wanted a baby of her own. Which event could cause Jenny adopted her niece and at last had a baby?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lily had a great birth. (B) Lily's sister Jenny, couldn't have a baby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lily's sister Jenny couldn't have a baby.\nExplanation: If Lily's sister Jenny couldn't have a baby, she may have decided to adopt her niece. This could have given Lily the opportunity to be around a baby and possibly even help care for her niece, which may have fulfilled her desire to have a baby of her own. Additionally, after adopting her niece, Jenny may have felt ready and able to have a baby of her own."}}
{"Q": "Sam wanted to be an elf for Halloween. Which event could cause Sam was a very convincing elf?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam made a costume out of material he bought from the store and he found some plastic elf ears online. (B) Sam bought a robot costume and wore it for Halloween.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Sam's decision to make a costume and find elf ears online shows that he put effort into creating a convincing elf costume. Buying a robot costume would not be relevant to Sam's goal of being an elf and would not contribute to his ability to convincingly portray an elf."}}
{"Q": "Amy had taken her sister Ali with to a friends house. Which event could cause Amy was dreading going home knowing her mother would blame her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy had lost her sister Amy. (B) Ali wasn't supposed to be out that day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ali wasn't supposed to be out that day.\nExplanation: If Ali wasn't supposed to be out that day, it means that Amy took her sister without permission or against their mother's wishes. This could lead to Amy being blamed by her mother for not following the rules and potentially putting Ali in danger. Losing her sister (option A) could also be a cause for concern, but it is less likely to result in Amy being blamed by her mother."}}
{"Q": "James was a student studying law. Which event could cause When he got the results back, he did very well?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) James studied hard for a major exam. (B) James dropped out and now attends bar at a popular nightclub.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: James studied hard for a major exam.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that James did well on his results because he studied hard for a major exam. Law school is known for its rigorous curriculum and demanding exams, so it is likely that James put in a lot of effort to prepare for his exams. On the other hand, dropping out of law school and becoming a bartender would not lead to good exam results."}}
{"Q": "Tim wanted to become a YouTube star. Which event could cause Tim made millions from his videos on YouTube?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim posted funny cat videos to Youtube. (B) Tim worked lazily creating videos.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Tim posted funny cat videos to Youtube.\nExplanation: Posting funny cat videos to YouTube has been a proven way to gain a large following and potentially make millions of dollars through advertising revenue and sponsorships. Many popular YouTube stars have gained their fame through posting entertaining and shareable content, such as funny cat videos. On the other hand, working lazily and creating low-quality videos is unlikely to attract a large audience and generate significant income. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lars had always wanted to try photography. Which event could cause Lars fell in love with photography?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lars had amazing original photographs and he got an awesome award. (B) Lars received prestigious awards for several original photographs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lars had amazing original photographs and he got an awesome award.\nExplanation: This event would likely cause Lars to fall in love with photography because it would validate his talent and hard work. Winning an award for his photographs would give him a sense of accomplishment and pride, and could inspire him to continue pursuing photography as a passion. On the other hand, receiving prestigious awards for several original photographs (option B) may also be a great achievement, but it does not necessarily indicate that Lars has fallen in love with photography."}}
{"Q": "Sam worried about the math exam he had later in the day. Which event could cause When the test came, he forgot all the important formulas due to stress?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam focused well during the test. (B) When Sam sat down in math class, he started sweating profusely.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) When Sam sat down in math class, he started sweating profusely.\n\nExplanation: Sweating profusely is a common physical symptom of stress and anxiety. This suggests that Sam was experiencing a high level of stress before the exam, which could have affected his ability to recall important formulas during the test. While it is possible that Sam could have still performed well despite his stress, forgetting important formulas is a common consequence of test anxiety. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Alec didn't like the fall. Which event could cause The only difference was that it keeps becoming easier as he grows?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alec got older and hated fall. (B) He hated raking the heavy piles of leaves.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He hated raking the heavy piles of leaves.\n\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the only difference was that it keeps becoming easier as he grows. This suggests that there was a specific task or activity that Alec disliked during the fall season, and that task became easier for him as he grew older. Option B, which mentions raking heavy piles of leaves, is a more plausible answer as it is a common task during the fall season that can be physically demanding and unpleasant for some people. As Alec grew older, he may have become stronger and more capable of handling the task, making it easier for him. Option A, on the other hand, is not a likely explanation as simply getting older does not necessarily mean that someone will start hating a particular season."}}
{"Q": "Jon needed to find a job. Which event could cause Finally, Jon had a job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jon created a job agency for hiring companies. (B) He sent his facebook link to many places.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Sending his Facebook link to many places is a more plausible answer because it suggests that Jon actively searched for job opportunities and reached out to potential employers. Creating a job agency would require significant resources and expertise, which may not be feasible for someone who is currently unemployed."}}
{"Q": "Anna was jogging with her phone in her pocket. Which event could cause She was so relieved to see it wasn't cracked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anne dropped her phone. (B) Anna's phone fell out of her pocket into nearby water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Anne dropped her phone.\nExplanation: If Anna had dropped her phone while jogging, it is more plausible that she would be relieved to see it wasn't cracked. Dropping a phone can cause it to crack or break, and it is a common fear for many people. On the other hand, if Anna's phone fell out of her pocket into nearby water, it is less likely that she would be relieved to see it wasn't cracked. In this scenario, the phone would likely be damaged by the water, and the focus would be on trying to salvage it rather than whether or not it was cracked."}}
{"Q": "Bob wanted a hamburger. Which event could cause He was excited?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His wife told him she had a great new hamburger recipe to try. (B) Bob's mother said he couldn't eat hamburgers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If Bob's wife told him she had a great new hamburger recipe to try, it would likely cause him to be excited about the prospect of eating a delicious hamburger. On the other hand, if Bob's mother said he couldn't eat hamburgers, it would likely cause disappointment or frustration rather than excitement. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Last night I decided to cook dinner for my boyfriend. Which event could cause My boyfriend still liked it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I lost part of the recipe while cooking dinner. (B) I made delicious pasta.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I made delicious pasta.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the boyfriend enjoyed the dinner because the pasta was delicious, rather than despite the fact that the recipe was lost. Making a tasty dish is usually the most important factor in determining whether someone likes a meal or not."}}
{"Q": "Mark had always taken monthly hunting trips with his dad. Which event could cause Mark still got to bond with his dad - over laughter and popcorn?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mark's dad broke his leg. (B) Mark broke his leg thus no more hunting.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Mark's dad broke his leg.\nExplanation: If Mark's dad broke his leg, it would prevent them from going on their usual hunting trips. However, they could still bond over laughter and popcorn while his dad is recovering from his injury. This could be a good opportunity for them to spend quality time together and create new memories. On the other hand, if Mark broke his leg, it would be difficult for them to engage in any physical activities together, including hunting or even going out to get popcorn. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "One Halloween, Gray was playing a game to find candy. Which event could cause At the end of the game, Gray had no candy because he would put it bac?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gray was giving other children candy. (B) Gray loved the game so much that he kept putting the candy back to find again.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Gray loved the game so much that he kept putting the candy back to find again.\n\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because it suggests that Gray was so engrossed in the game that he kept putting the candy back to prolong the fun of finding it. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Gray would have given away all his candy to other children, especially if he was actively playing the game to collect it."}}
{"Q": "Cindy was stressed out recently. Which event could cause She ended up walking more frequently?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She went inside for fresh air and realize that is what she needed. (B) Cindy felt better after taking a long walk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: When people are stressed, physical activity can be a helpful way to release tension and improve mood. Taking a long walk is a common strategy for stress relief, so it is plausible that Cindy would end up walking more frequently if she was feeling stressed. Option A is also possible, but it does not necessarily explain why Cindy would start walking more frequently."}}
{"Q": "Jakub had hoped to spend his entire life living in America. Which event could cause Jakub was very sad to say goodbye to his life in America?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jakub had to go home to visit family. (B) Jakub's visa was rejected and had to go home to Canada.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jakub's visa was rejected and had to go home to Canada.\nExplanation: If Jakub's visa was rejected, he would have to leave America and return to his home country of Canada. This would be a very sad event for him as he had hoped to spend his entire life in America. Visas are often difficult to obtain and the rejection would mean that Jakub would have to leave behind his life, friends, and possibly even his job in America. This would be a major disappointment for him and could cause him to be very sad."}}
{"Q": "For Halloween me and my sister wanted to dress as witches. Which event could cause Now to choose who is who?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My sister and I got a good witch costume and a bad witch costume. (B) My sister and I both got a good witch costume.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If both sisters have the same type of costume, there would be no reason for Now to choose who is who. However, if they have a good witch costume and a bad witch costume, Now could assign each sister to a specific role based on their personalities or preferences. This would add an extra level of fun and creativity to their Halloween costumes."}}
{"Q": "Gary always brought his lunch to work. Which event could cause Gary was very upset and went hungry?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) However, today Gary left his lunch at home. (B) A coworker of Garies ate his wallet and Gary didn't have any money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. However, today Gary left his lunch at home.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is a common mistake that people make. Forgetting to bring lunch to work can happen to anyone, and it would be understandable for Gary to be upset about it. On the other hand, the scenario in option B is highly unlikely and unrealistic, as it is not possible for a coworker to eat someone's wallet."}}
{"Q": "Mother told Tommy not to play with matches. Which event could cause The matches lit the paper in the trash bin and the house burned down?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When Mother went to bed, Tommy got the matches. (B) Mother played with matches anyway.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: The event where Tommy got the matches when Mother went to bed is more plausible because it follows the initial warning given by Mother not to play with matches. It also shows that Tommy disobeyed his mother's instructions, leading to a dangerous situation that resulted in the house burning down. On the other hand, option (B) is not plausible as it contradicts the initial statement that Mother told Tommy not to play with matches."}}
{"Q": "Lisa has a beautiful sapphire ring. Which event could cause She was elated when she found it on the bathroom floor?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One day, Lisa found her ring. (B) One day, Lisa lost her ring.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) One day, Lisa lost her ring.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lisa would be elated when she found her lost sapphire ring on the bathroom floor, rather than just randomly finding it one day. Losing something valuable can cause stress and anxiety, so finding it again would bring a sense of relief and happiness."}}
{"Q": "Alice was getting married in a few weeks. Which event could cause Alice messaged a cute guy she saw on Tinder?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice decided to have a big wedding. (B) Alice decided to break off the wedding.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Alice decided to have a big wedding.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alice, who is getting married in a few weeks, may feel overwhelmed or stressed about planning a big wedding. This could lead her to seek some distraction or validation from messaging a cute guy on Tinder. On the other hand, if Alice decided to break off the wedding, she would likely have more pressing matters to attend to and may not be interested in pursuing a new romantic interest at the moment."}}
{"Q": "Max woke up one Christmas morning. Which event could cause Max hugged his dad and started to cry?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Max discovered his dad hadn't been able to make it home for the holiday. (B) Max got a bike.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Max hugging his dad and crying suggests a strong emotional response, which is more likely to be caused by a negative event such as his dad not being able to make it home for the holiday. Getting a bike, while exciting, is not typically a reason for such a strong emotional reaction."}}
{"Q": "Lina has two kids. Which event could cause Lina made her kids wear clothes from the pile?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lina received a pile of adult clothes. (B) Lina didn't have time to wash school clothes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lina didn't have time to wash school clothes.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lina would make her kids wear clothes from the pile if she didn't have time to wash their school clothes, rather than if she received a pile of adult clothes. It is common for parents to have a pile of clean clothes that they use as backup when they don't have time to do laundry."}}
{"Q": "I went to japan last summer. Which event could cause I had a lot of fun and returned home with many memories?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I went to all the festivals. (B) The country was boring.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I went to all the festivals.\nExplanation: Japan is known for its vibrant and colorful festivals, such as the famous Gion Matsuri in Kyoto or the Nebuta Matsuri in Aomori. Attending these festivals would have provided a unique cultural experience and a lot of fun, with traditional music, dance, and food. It is highly unlikely that someone would find Japan boring if they attended all the festivals, as they offer a glimpse into the country's rich history and traditions. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I purchased an expensive sofa from a high end furniture store. Which event could cause I called each month and after two Year's, they told me to keep it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The store mistakenly gave me an extra pillow. (B) Right away, I knew I would love the sofa.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If the customer loved the sofa right away, it is unlikely that they would call the store every month for two years. Additionally, the fact that the store told them to keep it suggests that there was no issue with the sofa itself. Therefore, it is more plausible that the customer simply decided they no longer wanted the sofa and the store allowed them to keep it."}}
{"Q": "Barry loves playing baseball. Which event could cause Barry decided to leave the game?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Barry wasn't getting any work time. (B) Barry went to the ball park, but it started raining.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Barry went to the ball park, but it started raining.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Barry would leave the game due to external factors such as weather conditions, rather than internal factors such as not getting enough playing time. If it started raining, the game would likely be postponed or cancelled, which would cause Barry to leave the game."}}
{"Q": "We had ants in our Keurig coffeemaker recently. Which event could cause The ants finally disappeared?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We laid some ant traps to get them away. (B) We called an interior decorator to stop the source of the infestation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We laid some ant traps to get them away.\nExplanation: Ant traps are designed to attract and kill ants, which would effectively eliminate the ant infestation in the Keurig coffeemaker. Calling an interior decorator would not address the immediate problem of the ants in the coffeemaker and would not be a plausible solution."}}
{"Q": "Marty always liked Christmas time because she collects angels. Which event could cause To Marty's surprise her son bought the angel to give her as a gift?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a specific angel that she had already owned for quite some time. (B) Marty's son wanted to buy his mom a special gift.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Marty's son wanted to buy his mom a special gift.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is common for children to want to give their parents gifts during the holiday season. Additionally, the fact that Marty collects angels makes it likely that her son would choose an angel as a gift for her. Option (A) is also possible, but it is less likely as it would require Marty's son to know exactly which angel she already owned."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to make chicken curry. Which event could cause I enjoyed my meal of chicken curry?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I looked online and found a foul chicken curry recipe, then I went to the store and bought the ingredients. (B) I had never tried this recipe before.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Trying a new recipe for the first time can be exciting and enjoyable, especially if it turns out well. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person enjoyed their meal of chicken curry because they had never tried the recipe before. Option (A) suggests that the recipe was not good, which would not lead to a positive dining experience."}}
{"Q": "Sally planted a flower garden. Which event could cause Sally was proud of her creation?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sally ordered what she needed. (B) Sally tended her garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sally tended her garden.\nExplanation: Sally's pride in her creation would likely come from the effort she put into tending her garden, such as watering, weeding, and fertilizing. Ordering what she needed may have been a necessary step, but it would not necessarily be the cause of her pride in the final product."}}
{"Q": "Noah had a diaper rash. Which event could cause His rash healed up quickly with some clean air on it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Noah put powder on it. (B) Noah's parents learned that his skin needed to stay in the diaper.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Noah's parents learned that his skin needed to stay in the diaper, they would have allowed his skin to breathe by leaving the diaper off for a while. This would have allowed the rash to heal quickly with some clean air on it. Applying powder may have helped to soothe the rash, but it would not have been the main reason for the rash healing quickly. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Pam's most hated chore is vacuuming. Which event could cause Now she never has to vacuum?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Pam's mother told her she wouldn't vacuum instead. (B) She recently had back surgery and can no longer vacuum.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Pam's mother told her she wouldn't vacuum instead.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is a feasible solution that does not involve a major life event like back surgery. It is possible that Pam's mother offered to take over the chore of vacuuming, or they may have hired a cleaning service to handle it. This solution is more realistic and practical than Pam suddenly becoming physically unable to vacuum due to surgery."}}
{"Q": "There was a mechanic who didn't pay attention. Which event could cause The customer was angry he didn't pay attention to details?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He messed up a car by not giving it the care it needed. (B) The cook accidentally messed up a paint job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He messed up a car by not giving it the care it needed.\nExplanation: If the mechanic didn't pay attention to details and didn't give the car the care it needed, it could result in the car not functioning properly or breaking down. This would cause the customer to be angry as they would have to spend more money to fix the issue or even buy a new car. The cook accidentally messing up a paint job would not be related to the mechanic's lack of attention to detail and would not cause the customer to be angry with the mechanic."}}
{"Q": "Tom thought that football looked fun. Which event could cause He had tons of fun, and made a bunch of new friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom watched a football team. (B) Tom asked some people at the park to play.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom asked some people at the park to play.\nExplanation: If Tom watched a football team, he may have enjoyed the game but he wouldn't have had the opportunity to play or make new friends. However, if Tom asked some people at the park to play, he would have been able to participate in the game and potentially make new friends through the shared activity. This option is more plausible as it directly involves Tom in the activity he found fun and allows for social interaction."}}
{"Q": "Samantha had a flat tire. Which event could cause His mechanic was able to patch the tire up?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Samantha's boyfriend was the guy for the job.\". (B) Samantha's boyfriend knew a guy for the job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Samantha's mechanic was able to patch the tire up.\nExplanation: This is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the issue at hand - Samantha's flat tire. It is likely that Samantha took her car to a mechanic who was able to patch up the tire, rather than relying on her boyfriend or someone he knew to do the job."}}
{"Q": "Sarah rushed home to see her cat in labor Which event could cause Sarah found them loving homes by donating them to her friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sarah loved all the kittens so she kept them. (B) Sarah's cat gave birth to 8 healthy kittens.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Sarah loved all the kittens so she kept them.\n\nExplanation: Since Sarah loved all the kittens, it is more plausible that she would keep them rather than giving them away to her friends. Additionally, the fact that Sarah's cat gave birth to 8 healthy kittens does not necessarily have any direct correlation to Sarah finding them loving homes. Therefore, option (A) is a more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "Liz was babysitting a 5 year old boy. Which event could cause Liz got bored of the game and took a nap?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Liz never played board games with him. (B) Liz decided to play a board game with the boy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If Liz decided to play a board game with the boy, it is possible that the game was not engaging enough for her and she got bored. However, if Liz never played board games with him, it is unlikely that she would suddenly decide to take a nap during their time together."}}
{"Q": "Tanya wanted to mount both of her degrees on her wall. Which event could cause Tanya's internet start-up manager stopped her from hanging them?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tanya decided to put nails in the wall. (B) Tanya's boss didn't allow clutter on the walls.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tanya's boss didn't allow clutter on the walls.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tanya's boss had a policy against hanging personal items on the walls, rather than Tanya deciding to put nails in the wall without permission. Additionally, as an internet start-up manager, Tanya's boss may have wanted to maintain a clean and professional workspace without unnecessary clutter."}}
{"Q": "Joey was a second grader that like to color in coloring books. Which event could cause Joey felt proud of himself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joey mis-colored the picture. (B) Joey colored in 20 books.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Joey colored in 20 books.\nExplanation: Coloring in 20 books would be a significant accomplishment for a second grader and would likely make Joey feel proud of himself. On the other hand, mis-coloring a picture would likely make Joey feel disappointed or frustrated with himself. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jason woke up and went to prepare his daily cereal for breakfast. Which event could cause He compromised and ate his cereal dry?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When he stared pouring the milk he caught a nasty smell, the mild was sour. (B) Jason incompleted he was out of milk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jason realized he was out of milk.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is a common occurrence for people to run out of milk and have to eat their cereal dry. On the other hand, if the milk was sour, it would be unlikely for Jason to compromise and eat his cereal dry as it would not be appetizing."}}
{"Q": "Marcia went to a new hairdresser to get her hair done. Which event could cause She immediately went to her old hairdresser to get it fixed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Marica did not like the way her clothes turned out today. (B) Marcia got an awful haircut.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Marcia got an awful haircut.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because the event directly relates to the reason why Marcia would need to go to her old hairdresser to get her hair fixed. If she didn't like the way her clothes turned out, it wouldn't necessarily require her to go to her old hairdresser. However, if she got an awful haircut, it would make sense for her to seek out her old hairdresser for a fix."}}
{"Q": "Jacob was eager for the upcoming science fair. Which event could cause Jacob's efforts paid off when he took home the first place ribbon?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jacob made a small scale wind turbine farm. (B) Jacob prepared lazily all week.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jacob made a small scale wind turbine farm.\nExplanation: Jacob's eagerness for the science fair suggests that he was motivated and dedicated to his project. Making a small scale wind turbine farm requires research, planning, and execution, which are all signs of hard work and effort. Additionally, creating a project that is innovative and environmentally friendly could impress the judges and increase his chances of winning first place. On the other hand, preparing lazily all week would not likely result in a winning project."}}
{"Q": "Rick received a mysterious package in his mailbox. Which event could cause It was a surprise gift from his grandmother for his birthday?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rick was not sure what the individual was. (B) Rick opened and saw who the box was from.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Rick opened and saw who the box was from.\nExplanation: If Rick received a mysterious package in his mailbox, he would not know who it was from until he opened it. Once he opened the package and saw that it was from his grandmother, he would realize that it was a surprise gift from her for his birthday. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer. Option (A) is not relevant as it does not explain the cause of the mysterious package."}}
{"Q": "John was very nervous about his upcoming flight. Which event could cause John had no problem with his flight after he took his pill?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John was hesitant to take medication for anxiety. (B) He decided to take a pill.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He decided to take a pill.\nExplanation: Since John was nervous about his upcoming flight, taking a pill for anxiety could have helped him calm down and feel more relaxed during the flight. Therefore, it is more plausible that taking the pill helped him have no problem with his flight rather than being hesitant to take medication for anxiety."}}
{"Q": "Carlton hated to get rid of his encyclopedia set. Which event could cause He happily took them home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He thought he might need them. (B) His best friend gave them to Carlton.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He thought he might need them.\nExplanation: Carlton's initial feeling towards his encyclopedia set was that he hated to get rid of them, indicating that he valued them in some way. If he were to happily take them home, it would make sense that he had a reason to keep them, such as thinking he might need them in the future. On the other hand, if his best friend gave them to him, it may not necessarily change his feelings towards getting rid of them unless there was a sentimental value attached to the gift."}}
{"Q": "Amy wanted to meet Cinderella. Which event could cause Cinderella hugged Amy as her family took pictures?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy's mom found a dress up Cinderella or Amy to see. (B) Amy's family made her dream come true by taking her to florida.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If Amy's mom found a dress up Cinderella or Amy to see, it is more likely that Cinderella would be present and available for a meet and greet. If Amy's family simply took her to Florida, there is no guarantee that Cinderella would be there or available for a hug and photo. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gina was so excited for prom. Which event could cause Finally it was prom night, and Gina was so happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina brought a new dress and candles. (B) Gina got a date.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Gina got a date.\nExplanation: Getting a date for prom is a significant event for many high school students, and it can cause a lot of excitement and anticipation. Therefore, it is more plausible that Gina's happiness was due to getting a date rather than just buying a new dress and candles."}}
{"Q": "Cassidy was riding her bike. Which event could cause It turned out that her arm was broken?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She fell when she went under a rock and hurt her arm. (B) Cassidy fell and thought she was only scraped.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She fell when she went under a rock and hurt her arm.\nExplanation: Falling under a rock while riding a bike can cause a serious injury like a broken arm. On the other hand, a simple scrape is unlikely to result in a broken arm. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Alicia wanted to check out the ice cream shop nearby. Which event could cause She ended up getting many pints?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Alicia wanted a lot of ice cream. (B) Alicia was impressed by the one flavor the ice cream shop had.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Alicia wanted a lot of ice cream.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alicia ended up getting many pints because she wanted a lot of ice cream, rather than being impressed by just one flavor. If Alicia had been impressed by just one flavor, she would have likely only gotten one pint of that flavor. However, if she wanted a lot of ice cream, she would have gotten multiple pints of different flavors."}}
{"Q": "I finally got around to watching the movie Deadpool. Which event could cause I just enjoyed the gratuitous violence and excessive profanity?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was very illicit. (B) I didn't think I was going to like it at all.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for enjoying the movie was due to low expectations and being pleasantly surprised by the humor and action. The movie's reputation for being vulgar and violent may have also contributed to the enjoyment for some viewers. However, it is unlikely that the enjoyment was solely due to the illicit nature of the content."}}
{"Q": "Melissa invited Mark to the park for a picnic. Which event could cause Melissa and Mark spent all day talking and sharing food?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was a nice day, so Melissa and Mark stayed at the park. (B) Mark said he had other plans to Melissa.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If it was a nice day, Melissa and Mark would be more likely to want to stay at the park and enjoy the weather. Additionally, if they had planned a picnic, it would make sense for them to spend the day talking and sharing food. On the other hand, if Mark had other plans, it would be less likely for them to spend all day at the park together."}}
{"Q": "Mike was sitting at his desk. Which event could cause Mike had a stroke?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mike was eating greasy french fries. (B) He had been working at his desk for well over a month.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mike was eating greasy french fries.\nExplanation: Eating a diet high in saturated and trans fats, such as greasy french fries, can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which are both risk factors for stroke. Sitting at a desk for an extended period of time may increase the risk of other health issues, but it is less likely to directly cause a stroke."}}
{"Q": "Tom and Sally went to the beach. Which event could cause Tom eventually build an incredible sand castle and impressed Sally?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted to surf with Sally in the waves. (B) Tom wasn't sure if Sally liked him very much.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Tom wanted to surf with Sally in the waves.\nExplanation: If Tom wanted to surf with Sally in the waves, he would have spent a lot of time on the beach and would have had the opportunity to build a sandcastle. Additionally, if he was successful in surfing with Sally, it could have boosted his confidence and inspired him to build an impressive sandcastle to impress her. On the other hand, Tom's uncertainty about Sally's feelings towards him (option B) is unlikely to have any direct impact on his ability to build a sandcastle."}}
{"Q": "Larry has decided to help out his friends prepare for a party. Which event could cause Larry was happy that he could contribute to the party?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He put in half of his pay check. (B) They all had trouble cooking and decorating before the rest of the guests arrived.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Larry would be happy to contribute to the party by helping his friends with cooking and decorating, as it shows his willingness to lend a hand and be a good friend. Putting in half of his paycheck may be a generous gesture, but it is not necessarily indicative of his happiness or satisfaction with being able to contribute to the party."}}
{"Q": "Four Outlaws camped in Blood Gulch. Which event could cause He arrested them?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They found where the sheriff was. (B) The sheriff found where they were.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The sheriff found where they were.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the sheriff would be able to track down the outlaws' location rather than the outlaws finding the sheriff's location. Additionally, if the outlaws were causing trouble or committing crimes, it would make sense for the sheriff to actively search for them and apprehend them."}}
{"Q": "Mary woke up in the morning with a terrible pain in her mouth. Which event could cause Discomfort aside, Mary left very relieved and drove home to rest?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary went to the drug dealer to help her toothache. (B) She went to the dentist and said she would be fine and to take some medicine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary went to the dentist to seek professional help for her toothache. The dentist would have been able to diagnose the cause of the pain and provide appropriate treatment, such as prescribing medication or performing a procedure to alleviate the discomfort. Going to a drug dealer would not be a safe or effective solution for a dental issue."}}
{"Q": "My son encouraged me to read the Game of Thrones books. Which event could cause I told my son I was not interested in reading the other four books?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I decided to humor him and managed to get through the first book. (B) I watched the first book and did not like it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I decided to humor him and managed to get through the first book.\nExplanation: Since the question states that the son encouraged the mother to read the books, it is more likely that the mother would at least try to read the first book to please her son. If she did not like it, she could have stopped reading after the first book, but it is less likely that she would have dismissed the entire series without giving it a chance. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Joey was a second grader that like to color in coloring books. Which event could cause Joey wished his parent's appreciated him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He always gave his finished pictures to his parents and they would hang each one on the refrigerator. (B) Joey's parents didn't seem to be impressed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If Joey's parents didn't seem to be impressed with his coloring, it could make him feel like his efforts were not appreciated. This could lead him to wish that his parents appreciated him more. On the other hand, if his parents always hung his pictures on the refrigerator, it would likely make him feel appreciated and valued, so it would not be a likely cause for him to wish for more appreciation."}}
{"Q": "In 2009 my wife wanted to see the Christmas lights on Boston Common. Which event could cause The lights put her into a festive mood?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My wife saw the lights and decided it was time to get Christmas lights of our own. (B) My wife always went to go to church with her family.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Seeing the Christmas lights on Boston Common is a festive and joyful experience that can put anyone in the holiday spirit. It is more likely that my wife's mood was lifted by the beautiful lights and inspired her to want to decorate our own home with Christmas lights. Going to church with her family is a separate tradition and may not necessarily be related to her mood after seeing the lights."}}
{"Q": "Susan met a nice prince on the Internet. Which event could cause Susan still hopes her prince will find her again someday?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Susan and her prince got married. (B) The prince stopped talking to Susan.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The prince stopped talking to Susan.\nExplanation: If Susan and her prince got married, it would mean that they found each other again and there would be no reason for her to hope for him to find her again someday. However, if the prince stopped talking to Susan, it could mean that there was a misunderstanding or some other reason for the communication to stop. In this case, Susan may still hold onto the hope that they will reconnect in the future."}}
{"Q": "Brian's wife had 100 pairs of shoes. Which event could cause Pam and Brian have since gotten divorced?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Brian did not stop loving Pam. (B) Brian told Pam that she needed to control her spending.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Brian told Pam that she needed to control her spending.\n\nExplanation: It is possible that Pam's excessive spending on shoes could have caused financial strain on their relationship, leading Brian to confront her about it. If Pam did not take Brian's advice seriously or continued to overspend, it could have caused tension and ultimately led to their divorce. On the other hand, Brian's love for Pam may not have been the sole factor in their divorce, as there could have been other underlying issues in their relationship."}}
{"Q": "Tom wanted to start a garden in his backyard. Which event could cause Now his plants are starting to grow different fruits?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He used a raised bed with fertilizer. (B) Tom decided to plant vegetables.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He used a raised bed with fertilizer.\n\nExplanation: Using a raised bed with fertilizer can provide the plants with optimal growing conditions, which can lead to healthier and more productive plants. The use of fertilizer can also provide the necessary nutrients for the plants to grow and produce fruits. Therefore, it is more plausible that the use of a raised bed with fertilizer caused Tom's plants to grow different fruits. Planting vegetables alone would not necessarily cause the plants to produce different fruits."}}
{"Q": "Phil lived a normal life, until one day he experienced kidney failure. Which event could cause Phil's life was saved, and he was very thankful to the donor?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Phil got a replacement knee. (B) He went on the transplant list and received a call that he had a match.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He went on the transplant list and received a call that he had a match.\nExplanation: Kidney failure requires a kidney transplant to save the patient's life. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer as it suggests that Phil received a kidney transplant from a donor, which saved his life. Option A, on the other hand, is not related to kidney failure and would not have saved Phil's life."}}
{"Q": "Roz was thrilled when her boyfriend gave her a ring. Which event could cause Then she began doubting her boyfriend's love?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A friend then told Roz he was cheating. (B) Roz then cheated on her boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A friend then told Roz he was cheating.\nExplanation: Learning that her boyfriend is cheating on her is a common reason for someone to doubt their partner's love. It would be unlikely for Roz to doubt her boyfriend's love simply because she cheated on him."}}
{"Q": "Tom had a pet toad. Which event could cause Unfortunately, Jimmy's snake got to Tom's toad before he could?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom lost his toad while visiting his friend Jimmy. (B) one day Jimmy brought his dog over to Tom's and let it loose.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) one day Jimmy brought his dog over to Tom's and let it loose.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because dogs are known to have a natural instinct to hunt and catch small animals like toads. On the other hand, it is less likely for a snake to be able to get to a toad if it is kept in a secure enclosure or if it is being watched by its owner. Additionally, the scenario of Tom losing his toad while visiting Jimmy does not provide any explanation as to how Jimmy's snake could have gotten to the toad."}}
{"Q": "Allison cannot stand the taste of broccoli. Which event could cause Allison's father gives her another helping of broccoli on her plate?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) But she had a bad cold, so she ate some. (B) But Allison felt amazing, so she ate some.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Allison had a bad cold, her sense of taste might be compromised, making the taste of broccoli less unpleasant. Therefore, her father might give her another helping of broccoli on her plate. On the other hand, if Allison felt amazing, she would not have any reason to eat broccoli, and her father would not have a reason to give her more."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was trying to complete tasks for her boss. Which event could cause Kelly decided it was best to stick with what her boss told her to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly wanted to do the tasks her  boss's way. (B) Kelly had an idea to streamline the process.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kelly wanted to do the tasks her boss's way.\nExplanation: Kelly's primary goal is to complete the tasks assigned by her boss. If she wants to do the tasks her boss's way, it shows that she values her boss's instructions and wants to ensure that the tasks are completed correctly. On the other hand, if she had an idea to streamline the process, it could be a good thing, but it could also mean that she is deviating from her boss's instructions, which may not be the best approach in this scenario. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ana and her mom went to the toy store. Which event could cause Finally, she picked out a pink teddy bear?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ana's mom said she cannot pick out her own gift today. (B) Ana faced a store of impossible choices.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Ana faced a store of impossible choices.\nExplanation: This event could cause Ana to finally pick out a pink teddy bear because she may have been overwhelmed by the variety of toys in the store and struggled to make a decision. After considering all her options, she may have ultimately decided on the pink teddy bear as her choice. On the other hand, choice A does not seem to be a plausible answer as it does not relate to Ana's decision-making process for choosing the pink teddy bear."}}
{"Q": "Tim was throwing a dinner party. Which event could cause He still offered them drinks, though?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim's friends said they were not thirsty. (B) Tim's guests had already eaten drinks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If Tim's guests had already eaten, it would not necessarily mean they did not want drinks. Offering drinks is a common hospitality gesture, regardless of whether someone has already eaten or not. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tim's guests had already eaten and he still offered them drinks as a polite gesture."}}
{"Q": "Lenny wanted to watch a movie. Which event could cause He went back home and binge watched all of his movies?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lenny found a good movie on Netflix at home. (B) There was nothing he wanted to see at the theater.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There was nothing he wanted to see at the theater.\nExplanation: If Lenny couldn't find any movie that he wanted to watch at the theater, he might have decided to go back home and watch his own collection of movies instead. This is a more plausible reason for him to binge-watch his movies rather than finding a good movie on Netflix at home, as he could have done that any other day as well."}}
{"Q": "Janes dog died last week. Which event could cause She spent a few hours with us to help her forget missing her dog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Janes's aunt came over to see her. (B) Jane felt really neutral about it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Jane's aunt came over to see her.\nExplanation: Jane's aunt coming over to see her could be a plausible event that could cause her to spend a few hours with someone to help her forget missing her dog. It is common for people to seek comfort and support from their loved ones during times of grief and loss. Jane's aunt could have provided her with emotional support and distraction from her sadness, which could have helped her cope with the loss of her dog. On the other hand, feeling neutral about the loss of her dog (option B) is unlikely to cause Jane to seek out company or distraction."}}
{"Q": "Max hated doing homework. Which event could cause She sent a note to his parents explaining what he'd done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Max didn't turn in his homework to his teacher. (B) Max decided to run away from home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Max didn't turn in his homework to his teacher.\nExplanation: If Max didn't turn in his homework, his teacher would likely contact his parents to inform them of his lack of effort. In response, his parents may send a note explaining Max's behavior and discussing potential consequences. Running away from home seems like an extreme and unrelated event that would not necessarily lead to his parents receiving a note about his homework."}}
{"Q": "Jack bought a new book yesterday. Which event could cause Jack wished he had placed his book in a better spot?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack's book was stolen off the counter. (B) He left it inside and it got rained on.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Jack left his book inside and it got rained on, he would likely wish he had placed it in a better spot to avoid water damage. While it is possible for someone to steal his book off the counter, it is less likely to happen in a short amount of time since he just bought it yesterday. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Anthony wanted to learn how to speak Spanish. Which event could cause Anthony could not get the language down properly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Instead of going to the beach Anthony studied Spanish. (B) Anthony took a Spanish class but struggled.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Anthony took a Spanish class but struggled.\nExplanation: Even though Anthony took a Spanish class, he may have struggled with the language due to various reasons such as difficulty in understanding the grammar rules, lack of practice, or not being able to grasp the pronunciation. This is a more plausible answer as studying Spanish instead of going to the beach could actually help Anthony learn the language better."}}
{"Q": "I came home from work and was very hungry. Which event could cause I cooked the pasta and enjoyed it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) i prepared a dish for myself to eat. (B) I found the food cabinet to be empty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If the person came home hungry and found the food cabinet to be empty, it is unlikely that they would be able to cook pasta and enjoy it. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that they prepared a dish for themselves to eat, which happened to be pasta."}}
{"Q": "Naomi turned 15 on Thursday. Which event could cause Naomi had a wonderful birthday?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her parents gave her a great surprize pizza party. (B) Naomi got to meet the president at her dream.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Naomi had a wonderful birthday because her parents gave her a great surprise pizza party. Meeting the president is a rare and unlikely event, whereas a surprise party from loved ones is a common and achievable way to make someone's birthday special."}}
{"Q": "Gina's brother was in trouble. Which event could cause He was in big trouble, and Gina loved every minute of it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Usually Gina is the one getting him in trouble. (B) ginas brother had broken her moms expensive chair.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Usually Gina is the one getting him in trouble.\nExplanation: This event makes more sense as it suggests that Gina's brother is in trouble because of something Gina did, and she is enjoying seeing him get a taste of his own medicine. On the other hand, option B suggests that Gina's brother broke something valuable, which is unlikely to bring her joy."}}
{"Q": "Emily's grandfather often did something strange. Which event could cause If it was tails up, he'd leave it where it was?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One day grandfather found a cat on the sidewalk. (B) Emily's grandfather collected pennies found head up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Emily's grandfather collected pennies found head up.\nExplanation: If Emily's grandfather collected pennies found head up, it would make sense for him to leave a coin where it was if it was tails up, as it would not be considered lucky. This behavior aligns with the superstition that finding a penny with the head side up brings good luck, while finding one with the tails side up does not. On the other hand, finding a cat on the sidewalk would not necessarily have any connection to this behavior."}}
{"Q": "Judy was going to see a movie. Which event could cause Finally, she decided to just see a different movie?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The movie Judy wanted to see what sold out. (B) Judy had to break line for the one she wanted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The movie Judy wanted to see was sold out.\nExplanation: If the movie Judy wanted to see was sold out, she would not be able to see it and would have to choose a different movie to watch instead. Breaking line would not necessarily cause her to change her movie choice."}}
{"Q": "Tom told Jenny a secret. Which event could cause Tom became upset with Jenny?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom posted about her secret on his blog. (B) Jenny ignored him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Tom would likely become upset with Jenny if she shared his secret without his permission, especially if she did so publicly on a blog. This would be a breach of trust and could have negative consequences for Tom. On the other hand, Jenny ignoring him may not necessarily be related to the secret and may not cause him to become upset with her specifically for that reason."}}
{"Q": "Jake went to a walmart. Which event could cause He felt relieved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was ready to pay and thought he had lost his car keys, he finally found it in his pocket instead of his coat. (B) He was ready to pay and thought he had lost his debit card, he finally found it in his pocket instead of his wallet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Finding his car keys in his pocket instead of his coat would be a more plausible event that could cause Jake to feel relieved. Losing car keys can be a stressful situation, especially in a busy place like Walmart. Finding them in his pocket would alleviate that stress and cause him to feel relieved. Losing a debit card is also stressful, but it is a more common occurrence and may not cause as much relief as finding lost car keys."}}
{"Q": "The giant box containing my new reel mower had arrived. Which event could cause It works wonderfully and easily?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I pushed the wheelbarrow across the backyard. (B) I like my new mower.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Using the new reel mower to cut the grass.\nExplanation: The only event that could cause the new reel mower to work wonderfully and easily is actually using it to cut the grass. Pushing a wheelbarrow or liking the mower would not directly impact its performance."}}
{"Q": "Charlie loved to play catch with his dad. Which event could cause He made the team and made sure to bring his glove to practice?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So to make his Dad happy he tried out for the baseball team. (B) Charlie's dad told him to try out for the football team.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: The event that could cause Charlie to make the team and bring his glove to practice is that he tried out for the baseball team. This is a more plausible answer because the sentence mentions that Charlie loved to play catch with his dad, indicating that he has an interest in baseball. Additionally, the sentence does not mention anything about football, so it is unlikely that Charlie's dad told him to try out for the football team."}}
{"Q": "Kyle collected many things. Which event could cause Kyle thought Superman was a ridiculous construct?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kyle did not like Supergirl. (B) Kyle did not like Superman.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Since Kyle collected many things, it is likely that he was a fan of various fictional characters and superheroes. Therefore, it is more plausible that Kyle did not like Superman specifically, rather than disliking Supergirl, which is a separate character. This dislike could have led him to think that Superman was a ridiculous construct."}}
{"Q": "My teacher dismissed the class early since she had to leave. Which event could cause When I found it, all of my money was gone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I left my lunch bag at home. (B) I had left my wallet in the classroom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I had left my wallet in the classroom.\nExplanation: Since the teacher dismissed the class early, it is likely that the student did not have enough time to retrieve their wallet from the classroom before leaving. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student's money was gone because they left their wallet in the classroom rather than because they left their lunch bag at home."}}
{"Q": "Tom was playing baseball during lunch time. Which event could cause But he used it as an excuse to play another position?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He told the coach that no one else could play his position. (B) Tom didn't enjoy playing outfield and claimed he couldn't see.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom didn't enjoy playing outfield and claimed he couldn't see.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it suggests that Tom wanted to play a different position and used his supposed inability to see in the outfield as an excuse to do so. It is a common tactic for players to request a different position if they are not comfortable or confident in their current one. On the other hand, telling the coach that no one else could play his position seems unlikely and selfish."}}
{"Q": "Taylor struggled with math class. Which event could cause Taylor got a B+ on her test?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Taylor studied but all of the concepts didn't make any sense to her. (B) She studied real hard with a straight A student.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She studied real hard with a straight A student.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that studying with a straight A student would help Taylor understand the concepts better and improve her grade. Collaborating with someone who has a strong understanding of the subject matter can often lead to better comprehension and retention of the material. On the other hand, if Taylor studied but still didn't understand the concepts, it is less likely that she would have received a B+ on her test."}}
{"Q": "Mia went to the zoo on a field trip with her class. Which event could cause Mia decided that the lion was her favorite animal?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mia didn't see the animals at the zoo. (B) Mia loved all the animals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) Mia was fascinated by the lion's roar and behavior.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mia had a specific reason for choosing the lion as her favorite animal, rather than simply loving all the animals or not seeing them at all. The lion's roar and behavior are unique and captivating, which could have caught Mia's attention and made her decide that it was her favorite animal."}}
{"Q": "My sister's dog Olga was laying on the couch. Which event could cause She just lay down right on top of him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She moved Olga to his dog bed. (B) My sister sat down on the couch by Olga.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) My sister sat down on the couch by Olga.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Olga was already on the couch and my sister sat down next to her, causing her to lay down on top of Olga. It is unlikely that someone would move a dog from a comfortable spot on the couch to their dog bed just to lay down themselves."}}
{"Q": "Judy took her kids to the zoo. Which event could cause They could not wait to go back to the zoo?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Judy's nieces had a good time at the zoo. (B) judy's kids played with a lion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Judy's nieces had a good time at the zoo.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Judy's kids would want to go back to the zoo if they saw other children having a good time there, rather than if they played with a dangerous animal like a lion. Additionally, playing with a lion is not a safe or realistic scenario at a zoo. Therefore, option A is the more likely event that would make Judy's kids want to go back to the zoo."}}
{"Q": "I wanted Italian food. Which event could cause Alas, I ruined the cream base so the dish tasted terrible?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She decided to make alfredo sauce. (B) I tried a new recipe and followed the steps closely.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She decided to make alfredo sauce.\nExplanation: Alfredo sauce is a classic Italian sauce that is made with a cream base. If the cream base is ruined, it can significantly affect the taste of the dish. Therefore, it is more plausible that the event causing the ruined cream base and terrible taste of the dish was making alfredo sauce rather than trying a new recipe and following the steps closely."}}
{"Q": "Last year my uncle bought a metal detector. Which event could cause My uncle enjoys his hobby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He spends all morning walking up and down the beach enjoying the weather. (B) He spends all morning walking up and down the beach yelling at people.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He spends all morning walking up and down the beach enjoying the weather.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that my uncle would enjoy his hobby by spending time outdoors and enjoying the weather while using his metal detector. Yelling at people would not be a typical or enjoyable activity for someone using a metal detector."}}
{"Q": "Finley realized it was the day before her husband's birthday. Which event could cause Overnight delivery got the package to the house on time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She got him a great gift online last week. (B) She ordered him new golf clubs online.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She got him a great gift online last week.\nExplanation: If Finley had already purchased a gift online last week, then it is likely that she also selected the option for overnight delivery to ensure that the gift would arrive on time for her husband's birthday. On the other hand, ordering new golf clubs online may not necessarily require overnight delivery, and it is also possible that the delivery could be delayed due to various factors such as shipping delays or inventory issues. Therefore, option A seems like a more plausible explanation for why the package was delivered on time."}}
{"Q": "Ken enjoys running. Which event could cause He threw all of his attention into knitting, and he became happy agai?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ken fell and broke a flower so they took up a new hobby. (B) Ken got tired of running.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ken got tired of running.\nExplanation: If Ken got tired of running, it would make sense for him to look for a new hobby to fill his time and energy. Knitting could be a relaxing and fulfilling activity for him, and it could bring him happiness and a sense of accomplishment. On the other hand, if Ken fell and broke a flower, it seems unlikely that he would suddenly become interested in knitting as a way to cope with the incident."}}
{"Q": "Dan and Rob were playing in the back yard. Which event could cause Dan got in trouble for trampling the neighbors flowers?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rob threw the ball into the neighbor's yard and Dan ran to get it. (B) The neighbors ran through Dan's flowers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it involves Dan actively running towards the neighbor's yard, whereas option B involves the neighbors running through Dan's flowers, which is not directly related to Dan's actions. Additionally, option A involves a ball being thrown, which could be a common reason for Dan to run towards the neighbor's yard."}}
{"Q": "Jane had a pet bird. Which event could cause Jane's friend forgot to feed it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jane lets her friend cook the bird. (B) Jane noticed there was food in the cage.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jane noticed there was food in the cage.\nExplanation: If Jane noticed there was food in the cage, it is possible that she assumed her friend had already fed the bird and did not remind her. This is a more plausible scenario than Jane letting her friend cook the bird, which is highly unlikely and unrealistic."}}
{"Q": "Jackson has always wanted to play the bass guitar. Which event could cause Finally jackson is able to play bass guitar?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jackson took piano lessons. (B) the bass guitar team selected jackson.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The bass guitar team selected Jackson.\nExplanation: If Jackson is selected to play for the bass guitar team, it means he has the necessary skills to play the instrument. This would give him the opportunity to finally play the bass guitar and fulfill his dream. Taking piano lessons may improve his overall musical abilities, but it does not necessarily guarantee that he will be able to play the bass guitar. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My niece was scared of most characters at Disney. Which event could cause She said she was her favorite?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My loved Snow White, however. (B) My niece found Aladdin and liked him a lot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. My niece found Aladdin and liked him a lot.\nExplanation: Since the question states that the niece was scared of most characters at Disney, it is more plausible that she would find a character she liked rather than suddenly overcoming her fear of characters and liking Snow White. Aladdin is also a popular character among children, so it makes sense that the niece would enjoy meeting him."}}
{"Q": "Alan got a gun for his 18th birthday. Which event could cause He now loves to go hunting?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His dad took him hunting. (B) Alan decided to go hunting.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that Alan's interest in hunting was sparked by his dad taking him hunting, rather than him randomly deciding to go hunting after receiving a gun as a gift. Family members often pass down hunting traditions and skills, and it is common for fathers to take their sons hunting as a rite of passage. Therefore, it is more plausible that Alan's dad taking him hunting led to his love for the activity."}}
{"Q": "Janet had been working at her company for several Year's. Which event could cause However, eventually they came to an understanding and became friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Janet started dating one of her co-workers. (B) She and her husband often had arguments.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Janet started dating one of her co-workers.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Janet starting dating one of her co-workers could cause some initial tension or discomfort between them, but eventually they could come to an understanding and become friends. On the other hand, her personal issues with her husband's arguments would not necessarily have a direct impact on her relationship with her co-workers."}}
{"Q": "Tom was preparing for a business trip. Which event could cause This person helped to calm Tom down, and Tom enjoyed the flight?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom had a panic attack on his business trip flight. (B) Tom is interested in airplanes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Tom had a panic attack on his business trip flight.\nExplanation: If Tom had a panic attack on his business trip flight, it is plausible that someone helped to calm him down, and he enjoyed the flight. This could be due to the fact that he was anxious about flying, and the person who helped him was able to alleviate his fears and make him feel more comfortable. On the other hand, if Tom was interested in airplanes, it would not necessarily have an impact on his anxiety or enjoyment of the flight."}}
{"Q": "At age nine, Abby moved to a new neighborhood where she knew no one. Which event could cause That dog walked beside Abby all the way through her high school years?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) her parents got her a dog that became her best friend. (B) Every day, Abby's dog watched her walk to school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) her parents got her a dog that became her best friend.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Abby's dog became her best friend because she had no one else in her new neighborhood. Dogs are known to be loyal companions and can provide comfort and support to their owners. It is unlikely that a random dog would choose to walk beside Abby every day for years without any prior connection or bond."}}
{"Q": "Tim was on vacation. Which event could cause He decided to leave and go home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A party was headed for Tim's area. (B) But he wants to meet his family members.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tim would want to leave his vacation early to meet his family members rather than a party headed for his area. Family is an important factor for many people and it is understandable that Tim would prioritize spending time with them over continuing his vacation."}}
{"Q": "Jim's dad was getting up in years, turning ninety. Which event could cause When Jim's dad passed away, Jim felt so good about what he had done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim made sure he spend a lot of time with his dad. (B) He decided to have an extra special mothers day that year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jim made sure he spend a lot of time with his dad.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jim felt good about spending a lot of time with his dad before he passed away, rather than having an extra special Mother's Day. Spending time with loved ones before they pass away can bring a sense of comfort and closure, which could explain why Jim felt good about what he had done."}}
{"Q": "Joe used to own two dogs. Which event could cause Now, he seems happy with just one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) one of them passed away from old age. (B) One of them lived to old age.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) one of them passed away from old age.\nExplanation: Losing a pet can be a difficult and emotional experience, and it is not uncommon for pet owners to feel hesitant about getting another pet after the loss. It is possible that Joe's remaining dog is providing him with enough companionship and love, and he may not feel the need to get another dog at this time. On the other hand, if one of the dogs simply lived to old age, it is less likely that Joe would suddenly feel content with just one dog, as he may have been used to having two dogs around for a long time."}}
{"Q": "Andre was kicking flowers in the yard. Which event could cause He never ignored a warning ever again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His father warned him. (B) He ignored the sign and got stung by a bee.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: If Andre ignored a sign and got stung by a bee, it could be a painful and memorable experience that would make him realize the importance of paying attention to warnings. This event could potentially cause him to never ignore a warning again. On the other hand, his father warning him about kicking flowers may not have as strong of an impact on him."}}
{"Q": "Amy and Beth were best friends. Which event could cause Amy slapped Beth when she made it seem like it was no big deal?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Beth betrayed Amy and did not seem to care. (B) Beth confessed that she slept with her own boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Betrayal is a serious offense in any friendship, and if Beth betrayed Amy and did not seem to care, it could have caused Amy to react with anger and frustration. On the other hand, Beth confessing to sleeping with her own boyfriend may not necessarily be a reason for Amy to slap her, as it does not directly involve Amy or their friendship."}}
{"Q": "Anna heard a weird noise from her car. Which event could cause He said Anna's car would only cost $90 to fix?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna kicked her car. (B) Anna took the car to the mechanic to see what was wrong.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Anna took the car to the mechanic to see what was wrong.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anna would take her car to a mechanic to diagnose and fix the issue rather than kicking her car, which would not solve the problem and could potentially cause more damage. The mechanic would be able to identify the source of the weird noise and provide an estimate for the cost of repairs."}}
{"Q": "After finishing my homework, I started to exercise. Which event could cause Since it was 12 in the afternoon, I decided to skip school?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was supposed to be at school but was running late. (B) I exercised for a few hours and then went to school without setting my alarm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I was supposed to be at school but was running late.\nExplanation: If the person was running late for school, they may have decided to skip it altogether since it was already 12 in the afternoon. However, if they had already exercised for a few hours and then went to school without setting their alarm, it is unlikely that they would have missed school altogether."}}
{"Q": "Melissa never drank wine. Which event could cause Melissa started drinking wine every night?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Melissa had one glass at dinner and loved it. (B) Valerie decided to try it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Melissa trying wine for the first time and loving it is a more plausible reason for her to start drinking it every night than someone else deciding to try it. Personal experience and enjoyment are often strong motivators for behavior change."}}
{"Q": "I looked over at the teenager and asked her to quiet down. Which event could cause Sadly, I had to tell her not to come if she could not listen?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teenager scoffed and kept being loud. (B) The teenager still would not climb down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The event that could cause the speaker to tell the teenager not to come if she could not listen is if the teenager scoffed and kept being loud despite being asked to quiet down. This shows a lack of respect for the speaker and the rules of the situation, which would warrant the consequence of not being allowed to come if the behavior continued. The second option, the teenager still would not climb down, does not make sense in the context of the sentence and is not a plausible event that would lead to the consequence mentioned."}}
{"Q": "Bob discovered his truck had a flat tire. Which event could cause Bob called someone to fix his flat tire?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He didn't know how to fix it himself. (B) Bob called someone to fix his trucks flat tire.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He didn't know how to fix it himself.\nExplanation: If Bob didn't know how to fix the flat tire himself, it would be more plausible for him to call someone to fix it for him. If he knew how to fix it, he would likely do it himself rather than calling someone else."}}
{"Q": "Shawn raised fish for fun. Which event could cause Shawn was sad, but grew to love the growing carnivore?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) But Shawn put a carnivorous fish in with them and the fish ate all the others. (B) A piranha nurtured Shawn's favorite rainbow fish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If Shawn put a carnivorous fish in with his other fish and it ate all the others, he would initially be sad about losing his fish. However, he may grow to love the challenge of raising a carnivorous fish and learning how to properly care for it. On the other hand, it is unlikely that a piranha would nurture Shawn's favorite rainbow fish, as piranhas are known for their aggressive and predatory behavior."}}
{"Q": "Last year my uncle bought a metal detector. Which event could cause My uncle hates the beach?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He realized he doesn't want to use it anywhere but the beach. (B) He set it down to examine something and someone ran off with it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He realized he doesn't want to use it anywhere but the beach.\nExplanation: Since the metal detector was purchased last year, it is likely that he has already used it at other locations besides the beach. If he hated the beach, it is unlikely that he would have bought a metal detector specifically for that location. Therefore, it is more plausible that he realized he only wants to use it at the beach and not at other locations."}}
{"Q": "Olivia has a physics test tomorrow. Which event could cause Unfortunately, she falls asleep in the morning and misses the test?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Olivia fell asleep early being tired from studying. (B) Olivia stayed up all night to study.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Olivia fell asleep early due to exhaustion from studying, rather than staying up all night to study. Staying up all night would likely cause her to be too anxious or wired to fall asleep in the morning, whereas being tired from studying could lead to oversleeping and missing the test."}}
{"Q": "In the hot summer months nothing soothes Tam's thirst like green tea. Which event could cause For Tam nothing beats a hot day and a cold glass of iced mango heaven?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tam buys plenty of problems. (B) Tam had a cold glass of tea.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tam had a cold glass of tea.\n\nExplanation: The statement mentions that green tea soothes Tam's thirst in the hot summer months, indicating that Tam prefers cold beverages during this season. Therefore, it is plausible that Tam would enjoy a cold glass of iced mango heaven on a hot day, as it would provide a refreshing and cooling effect. Option (A) is not related to the context and does not provide a logical explanation for Tam's preference for iced mango heaven."}}
{"Q": "Sarah was diagnosed with cancer 4 Years ago. Which event could cause She was cancer free?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sarah's nephew had a follow up cancer screening. (B) Sarrah went for sdpecialised medical care.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sarah went for specialised medical care.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sarah's cancer-free status was a result of her seeking specialised medical care, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery, rather than her nephew having a follow-up cancer screening. Follow-up screenings are important for detecting cancer early, but they do not necessarily cause someone to become cancer-free. Seeking specialised medical care, on the other hand, can lead to successful treatment and remission of cancer."}}
{"Q": "Greg never thought he'd boo-boo on himself. Which event could cause One party goer thought the house pet used the bathroom on the floor?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Greg made a mess at a party. (B) Greg ate something to calm his stomach.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Greg made a mess at a party.\nExplanation: If Greg made a mess at a party, it is possible that someone mistook it for him having an accident on himself. This scenario is more plausible than Greg eating something to calm his stomach, as there is no indication that he was feeling unwell or had any digestive issues."}}
{"Q": "My parents came from China. Which event could cause He bought candy Year's later when he learned about Halloween?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My uncle camee to visit last year on Christmas. (B) They did not know our customs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They did not know our customs.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for buying candy for Halloween was because the parents were not familiar with the customs and traditions of Halloween in the United States. As immigrants, they may not have grown up celebrating Halloween in China and may not have been aware of the holiday until later on. Therefore, it is likely that they learned about Halloween and its traditions, such as trick-or-treating, and bought candy to participate in the holiday."}}
{"Q": "John was training for a marathon. Which event could cause On the day of the race, he finished in record time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John trained day and night and worked very hard to build his endurance. (B) John hardly had any time to train regularly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: If John trained day and night and worked very hard to build his endurance, it is more likely that he would perform well on the day of the race and finish in record time. On the other hand, if John hardly had any time to train regularly, it is less likely that he would be able to perform at his best on the day of the race. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kolton loves apples. Which event could cause He ate three apples for dinner that night?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kolton didn't feel like preparing an actual dinner. (B) Kolton made a 3 course meal for dinner that was amazing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Kolton didn't feel like preparing an actual dinner, he may have just grabbed three apples to eat instead. This is a more plausible explanation than him making a 3 course meal and still having room for three apples for dessert."}}
{"Q": "Jon decided to go on vacation. Which event could cause When Jon figured out, he fired the person?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jon received a call from an employee about a promotion. (B) His employee took advantage and only worked 20 hours that week.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His employee took advantage and only worked 20 hours that week.\nExplanation: If Jon found out that his employee took advantage and only worked 20 hours that week, it would be a valid reason for him to fire the person. This behavior shows a lack of responsibility and commitment to the job, which could cause problems for Jon's business. On the other hand, receiving a call from an employee about a promotion would not necessarily lead to firing someone."}}
{"Q": "Tom was playing ball outside. Which event could cause Tom took the kitten home with him to keep?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom found a kitten. (B) Tom found a kitten meowing by itself that looked well cared for.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom found a kitten meowing by itself that looked well cared for.\nExplanation: If Tom found a kitten meowing by itself that looked well cared for, it is more likely that he would take the kitten home with him to keep. This is because the kitten may have been lost or abandoned and in need of a home. If Tom simply found a kitten without any indication that it needed help, he may not have felt the need to take it home with him."}}
{"Q": "Evelyn lived in a hotel in Mexico. Which event could cause A grocery store owner cashes Evelyn's checks with no ID?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her mom sent her paychecks for Evelyn to cash. (B) Evelyn cashes her checks at different grocery stores every week.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Evelyn's mom sent her paychecks for her to cash, and the grocery store owner recognized her and cashed the checks without asking for ID. It is less likely that Evelyn would be cashing her checks at different grocery stores every week without providing ID, as most stores have policies in place to prevent check fraud."}}
{"Q": "Jess overheard an employee incriminate themselves to another. Which event could cause The employee was confronted and dealt with accordingly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jess hid it from her manager who followed company procedure. (B) he knew thst against the regalastions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The employee knew that it was against the regulations.\nExplanation: If Jess reported the incident to her manager, and the manager followed company procedure, then the employee would have been confronted and dealt with accordingly. However, if Jess hid the incident from her manager, then the employee would not have been held accountable for their actions. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the employee was aware that their actions were against the regulations and would have been held accountable for them."}}
{"Q": "Alissa was very stressed out. Which event could cause Alissa felt very relaxed at the end of the day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So Alissa's friends took her to a spa to relax. (B) Alissa went home and worked more .", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) So Alissa's friends took her to a spa to relax.\nExplanation: Going to a spa is a common way to relax and destress. Alissa's friends taking her to a spa shows that they care about her well-being and want to help her relax. This would be a plausible event that could cause Alissa to feel very relaxed at the end of the day. On the other hand, going home and working more would only add to Alissa's stress and would not be a plausible event that could cause her to feel relaxed."}}
{"Q": "Simon noticed a moving truck in front of the house next door. Which event could cause He yelled at her and went home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The moving truck was blocking the sidewalk. (B) Simon was angry that Ann was leaving.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Simon was angry that Ann was leaving.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Simon's emotional state and behavior. If Simon was close to Ann and upset about her leaving, it would make sense for him to yell at her and go home. On the other hand, the moving truck blocking the sidewalk may be frustrating, but it doesn't necessarily explain Simon's extreme reaction."}}
{"Q": "Ella was taking her final exam. Which event could cause Ella was able to finish her exam on time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ella got to class early and was in no hurry. (B) Ella broke her pencil.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ella got to class early and was in no hurry.\nExplanation: If Ella got to class early, she would have had enough time to settle down and prepare herself for the exam. Being in no hurry would have allowed her to take her time and answer the questions carefully, ensuring that she finished the exam on time. Breaking her pencil, on the other hand, would have caused a delay and potentially slowed her down, making it less likely for her to finish on time."}}
{"Q": "Ron liked his new apartment, but it was pretty hot in there. Which event could cause Len helped Ron install it and the place became cool and comfortable?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ron had to buy a new air conditioning unit. (B) Len, Ron's friend brought him an old heating unit he had.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ron had to buy a new air conditioning unit.\nExplanation: Since the apartment was hot, it is more plausible that Ron needed an air conditioning unit to cool the place down. Len bringing an old heating unit would not have helped with the heat and would have made the apartment even hotter. Therefore, option A is the more likely event that caused the place to become cool and comfortable."}}
{"Q": "Devon woke up feeling terrible, with a stuffy head and sore throat. Which event could cause Devon rested up the rest of the day, knowing they were right?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Devon's children said he had a cold & should take it easy. (B) He went to the doctor and was diagnosed with the flu.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Devon's children, who are likely to be around him and notice his symptoms, would recognize that he has a cold and advise him to rest. Going to the doctor and being diagnosed with the flu would require more time and effort, and it is less likely that Devon would immediately seek medical attention for what he may assume is just a cold."}}
{"Q": "Oscar never made his bed. Which event could cause She gave him a dessert treat?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Oscar relented and finally made his bed. (B) Oscar's mom finally made Oscar's bed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Oscar relented and finally made his bed.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Oscar would receive a dessert treat as a reward for finally making his bed, rather than his mom making his bed for him. This would encourage Oscar to take responsibility for his own actions and develop good habits."}}
{"Q": "My mother told me to fix the car. Which event could cause It turns out they were stolen the night before?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I went to get the parts out of my garage and grabbed them. (B) I wasn't sure what was wrong but the break lights were not coming on.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I went to get the parts out of my garage and grabbed them.\nExplanation: If the car parts were stolen the night before, it is unlikely that the person would be able to retrieve them from their garage. Therefore, option A is less plausible. Option B does not relate to the stolen car parts and is not relevant to the question."}}
{"Q": "Jessie wanted to adopt a dog so she drove to the local shelter. Which event could cause The puppy was happy again, and Jessie had found her new dog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A sad puppy caught her attention and wanted to be pet. (B) Jessie couldn't make a choice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A sad puppy caught her attention and wanted to be pet.\nExplanation: If Jessie saw a sad puppy and was able to connect with it, she may have felt compelled to adopt it and give it a loving home. This would make the puppy happy again and Jessie would have found her new dog. Option B is less plausible because if Jessie couldn't make a choice, she wouldn't have been able to adopt a dog and the puppy would still be waiting for a home."}}
{"Q": "Gina's mom caught her yelling out the window on the 2nd floor. Which event could cause They opened the screen and began throwing things outside?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) But worse was to come from the bad storm. (B) Gina saw someone spray painting the building.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Gina saw someone spray painting the building.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gina's reaction of yelling and throwing things out the window was caused by seeing someone vandalizing the building, rather than a bad storm. The storm may have caused damage or inconvenience, but it is unlikely to have provoked such a strong reaction from Gina."}}
{"Q": "Jerome wanted to buy a new television. Which event could cause Jerome enjoyed watching his favorite movies on his new television?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jerome set aside money from every paycheck for the television. (B) Jerome worked hard to save up money, and used it to sell a television.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Jerome working hard to save up money and using it to buy a television is a more plausible answer because it directly leads to him being able to purchase the television and enjoy watching his favorite movies on it. Setting aside money from every paycheck is a good financial habit, but it does not necessarily guarantee that Jerome will be able to afford the television he wants."}}
{"Q": "Bob started working on Mturk to get some money. Which event could cause Bob eventually game a lead moderator of the MTG?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob spent hours doing HITs each day. (B) Bob decided to move down the work ladder.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Spending hours doing HITs each day would give Bob a lot of experience and knowledge about the platform, which could eventually lead to him becoming a lead moderator. It would also show his dedication and commitment to the job, which are important qualities for a lead moderator. Moving down the work ladder, on the other hand, would not necessarily lead to becoming a lead moderator."}}
{"Q": "Uncle Jock couldn't believe he was rich. Which event could cause Jock lived the good life for a whole year, until he was poor again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He went to town and spent on extravagant things. (B) Jock poorly managed his finances.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Jock poorly managing his finances is a more plausible answer as it is common for people who suddenly come into wealth to overspend and not properly manage their money. This can lead to them quickly becoming poor again. Going to town and spending on extravagant things may contribute to poor financial management, but it is not the sole cause of Jock's potential downfall."}}
{"Q": "Jen loved to take walks in gardens and see flowers. Which event could cause Jen cut a few flowers and took them home with her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jen took a walk an saw some long weeds. (B) She walked through a garden at the park.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She walked through a garden at the park.\nExplanation: Since Jen loves to take walks in gardens and see flowers, it is more plausible that she would cut a few flowers and take them home with her after walking through a garden at the park rather than seeing some long weeds on her walk. Weeds are not typically considered desirable for cutting and taking home, whereas flowers in a garden are intentionally planted and cared for to be enjoyed by visitors."}}
{"Q": "Sue's husband always talked about a gorgeous celebrity. Which event could cause He took one look and said she had ruined her best feature?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) When she narrated about the celebrity's personal life to her husband. (B) His favorite celebrity got the bump removed from her nose.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the husband's favorite celebrity getting the bump removed from her nose could cause him to say she had ruined her best feature. This change in the celebrity's appearance could have been a significant factor in the husband's opinion. On the other hand, narrating about the celebrity's personal life may not have any impact on the husband's perception of her physical appearance."}}
{"Q": "Emma went to the zoo today. Which event could cause Emma knows that if she wants to see a monkey she has to go to the zoo?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Emma wouldn't leave until she saw the monkeys. (B) Emma left before seeing monkeys.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Emma wouldn't leave until she saw the monkeys.\nExplanation: If Emma stayed at the zoo until she saw the monkeys, it is likely that she learned that the zoo has monkeys and where they are located. This would cause her to know that if she wants to see a monkey, she has to go to the zoo. On the other hand, if Emma left before seeing monkeys, she may not have known that the zoo has monkeys or where they are located. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I once had a grey cat. Which event could cause Eventually I moved and Hero stayed and it was sad?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cat was named Hero. (B) I decided to take Hero with me on the move.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I decided to take Hero with me on the move.\nExplanation: If the owner decided to take Hero with them on the move, it would be sad for Hero to be left behind. This would explain why the owner moved and Hero stayed, causing sadness. The fact that the cat was named Hero is not relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Stella was naturally good at basketball. Which event could cause She practiced extra long, and hard to prepare for that day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Stella got her team out of the championship game. (B) Stella hoped to make it to the WMBA.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Stella hoped to make it to the WMBA.\nExplanation: If Stella was naturally good at basketball, it is more likely that she would want to pursue a career in basketball, such as playing in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Therefore, she would practice extra long and hard to prepare for that goal. Getting her team out of the championship game would not necessarily require extra practice, as it could be achieved through other means such as strategy or teamwork."}}
{"Q": "What time is it he thought shuffling through papers. Which event could cause Bill was stunned to see it was almost two o'clock?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bill thought he had lost track of time. (B) He decided to shuffle some papers before looking at the clock.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Bill thought he had lost track of time.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if Bill had intentionally shuffled papers before looking at the clock, he would have been aware of the time and not stunned to see it was almost two o'clock. However, if he had been engrossed in his work and lost track of time, it would make sense for him to be surprised when he finally checked the clock."}}
{"Q": "Amy's friend Erin told her Sara had been making fun of her. Which event could cause She decided she would call Sarah to hear her side?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy didn't know why Sara would make fun of her. (B) Amy wanted to be angry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Amy's decision to call Sarah to hear her side suggests that she is seeking clarification and understanding of the situation. If she simply wanted to be angry, she would not have bothered to reach out to Sarah. Additionally, the fact that Amy didn't know why Sara would make fun of her indicates that she is open to hearing different perspectives and is not jumping to conclusions."}}
{"Q": "Gary always brought his lunch to work. Which event could cause Gary then bought something from the machine at work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) However, Gary had a craving for something sweet. (B) However, Gary craved something sweet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) However, Gary had a craving for something sweet.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gary would buy something from the machine if he had a specific craving for something sweet, rather than just a general craving. This suggests that he had a specific desire for a particular snack that he could only get from the vending machine, rather than just feeling like snacking in general."}}
{"Q": "Sarah drove around town one Saturday to get out of the house. Which event could cause She ate the ice cream and drove home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she noticed a new ice cream place and stopped to get some. (B) She visited her favorite homeless shelter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is a more plausible answer as it provides a reason for Sarah to stop and get ice cream. Option B does not provide any reason for Sarah to stop at a homeless shelter and then suddenly decide to eat ice cream and drive home. Additionally, the sentence mentions that Sarah drove around town to get out of the house, which suggests that she was exploring and looking for something to do, making it more likely that she would stop at a new ice cream place."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy heard a mean comment that was directed towards him. Which event could cause Before he got extremely close, I called the teacher to handle him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So he yelled back and started walking to the boy. (B) I saw Jimmy lift a balloon behind the bully's head.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Jimmy yelled back and started walking towards the boy, it could be a sign that he was about to confront the bully physically. In this situation, it would be appropriate to call the teacher to handle the situation before it escalates into a physical altercation."}}
{"Q": "Lisa wanted to get a new puppy. Which event could cause Lisa and Gizmo went home together?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa bought a new pet in Chinatown, and named it Gizmo. (B) Lisa stole a puppy named gizmo at the shelter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Lisa went to Chinatown to buy a new pet and named it Gizmo. This scenario is more ethical and legal compared to option B, where Lisa stole a puppy from a shelter. It is important to promote responsible pet ownership and discourage theft or illegal acquisition of animals."}}
{"Q": "My cousin and I were about to go on the space mountain ride at Disney. Which event could cause Thankfully it was over before I knew it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We got on but the ride was broken we got off and cried from disappointment. (B) We were able to get in the front row and I closed my eyes the whole time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it involves a potential negative experience that could cause someone to be relieved that it was over quickly. If the ride was broken and they had to get off, it would be disappointing and potentially upsetting."}}
{"Q": "There was a scared bird in a nest. Which event could cause The bird was okay and things were good?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Another bird came to eat the scared bird for dinner. (B) The birds mother returned to the nest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The birds mother returned to the nest.\nExplanation: The presence of the mother bird would provide comfort and security to the scared bird, indicating that things were good and the scared bird was safe. On the other hand, the arrival of another bird to eat the scared bird would be a threatening event and would not result in the scared bird being okay. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gina's family was going to a funeral out of town. Which event could cause Gina read, and the little kids colored most of the drive there?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Everyone took a one plane, and Gina had to ride in the back with the kids. (B) The drive to the funeral was about 6 hours long.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the drive to the funeral was long and the kids were given coloring books or other activities to keep them occupied, while Gina may have chosen to read during the drive. It is less likely that everyone took a plane and Gina was forced to sit in the back with the kids, as this scenario would not explain why the kids were coloring."}}
{"Q": "Venita used to love her job. Which event could cause She quit without notice?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Venita then grew tired but then she got over it. (B) Venita had a rough few months by clashing with her boss.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Venita had a rough few months by clashing with her boss.\nExplanation: If Venita had a rough few months by clashing with her boss, it could cause her to become unhappy with her job and ultimately lead to her quitting without notice. This is a more plausible answer than option (A) because simply growing tired of a job does not typically lead to quitting without notice."}}
{"Q": "May bet her friend Jen that she could not complete a milk challenge. Which event could cause May won the bet?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jen started the milk challenge and failed it. (B) Jen stopped the milk challenge and failed it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jen started the milk challenge and failed it.\n\nExplanation: If Jen started the milk challenge and failed it, then she did attempt to complete it, which was the condition of the bet. If Jen stopped the milk challenge and failed it, it would imply that she did not even try to complete it, which would not fulfill the conditions of the bet. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Amy was as at the Minnesota State Fair with Beth. Which event could cause She purchased 2 more to take home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy had a big bear but was not satisfied. (B) Amy loved walking by the vendors.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Amy had a big bear but was not satisfied.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Amy already made a purchase (a big bear) but was still not satisfied with her fair experience. Therefore, she decided to purchase 2 more items to take home. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear reason for why Amy would purchase 2 more items. Simply loving to walk by vendors does not necessarily lead to making additional purchases."}}
{"Q": "Tommy was having a bad day. Which event could cause Tommy had bad friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His friends commiserated about his bad day. (B) Tommy was ditched by both of his best friends even though they knew he was down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tommy was ditched by both of his best friends even though they knew he was down.\n\nExplanation: If Tommy's best friends ditched him on a bad day, it could be a sign that they are not good friends. This event could cause Tommy to have bad friends and contribute to his bad day. On the other hand, if his friends commiserated about his bad day, it shows that they are empathetic and supportive, which would not cause Tommy to have bad friends. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Samantha wanted a treat. Which event could cause She had to run cold water on it to reduce the pain?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She burned her tongue on hot cookies. (B) Samantha burned the cookies while baking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She burned her tongue on hot cookies.\nExplanation: If Samantha burned the cookies while baking, she would not have had the opportunity to eat them and burn her tongue. It is more plausible that she was excited to eat the cookies and did not wait for them to cool down, resulting in burning her tongue and needing to run cold water on it to reduce the pain."}}
{"Q": "I was at a bar with some friends to celebrate. Which event could cause The strange man gave me a wink and turned away?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I saw a man across the rrom staring at us. (B) A gentleman approached me.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the strange man gave a wink and turned away because he was staring at the group from across the room, rather than because a gentleman approached the speaker. The former scenario suggests that the strange man may have been observing the group and found the speaker attractive or interesting, while the latter scenario does not necessarily imply any particular interest or reaction from the strange man."}}
{"Q": "James had arranged to propose in a hot air balloon. Which event could cause They were drenched by the time the balloon landed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Unfortunately the darkness James picked there was a thunderstorm. (B) James was not counting on a rain storm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) James was not counting on a rain storm.\n\nExplanation: A rain storm could cause the couple to get drenched during the hot air balloon ride and upon landing. This is a more plausible answer as it is a common weather occurrence and James may not have checked the weather forecast before planning the proposal. On the other hand, a thunderstorm is less likely to occur during the time James had arranged for the proposal and may seem like an unlikely event."}}
{"Q": "Quinton was getting evicted from his apartment. Which event could cause Quinton was so happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Quinton ended up not getting evicted. (B) His girlfriend said he could live at the shelter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Quinton ended up not getting evicted.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Quinton would be happy if he did not get evicted from his apartment, rather than having to live at a shelter. Being able to keep his own living space and not having to uproot his life would likely bring more relief and happiness to Quinton."}}
{"Q": "Henry joined a pie eating contest. Which event could cause He told us that on the bright side, he got free food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Henry won the contest. (B) Henry lost the contest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Henry lost the contest, he may have been disappointed that he didn't win, but he still got to eat free pie as a participant. This is a more plausible scenario than if he had won the contest, as winning would likely have been a more significant source of satisfaction than just getting free food."}}
{"Q": "Andrew went camping. Which event could cause He made a mess in his sleeping bag that night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Andrew stayed up all night looking at the stars. (B) Andrew was very scared.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Andrew was very scared.\nExplanation: If Andrew was very scared, he may have had trouble sleeping and could have accidentally spilled food or drinks in his sleeping bag or knocked over his backpack, causing a mess. Staying up all night looking at the stars would not necessarily lead to making a mess in his sleeping bag."}}
{"Q": "Noah was excited and nervous to use his new sled. Which event could cause It was a proud moment when Noah conquered his fear of the steep hill?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Noah was afraid of hitting a tree. (B) Noah decided to try it on the flattest streets.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Noah was afraid of hitting a tree.\nExplanation: If Noah was afraid of hitting a tree, it suggests that he was attempting to sled down a steep hill with obstacles, which would require him to overcome his fear and take a risk. Conquering this fear would be a proud moment for him, as he would have successfully navigated a challenging situation. On the other hand, if he decided to try it on the flattest streets, it suggests that he was not facing a significant challenge, and therefore there would be no reason for him to feel proud of himself for conquering his fear."}}
{"Q": "Matt and Zack were brothers and best friends. Which event could cause He ended up in the hospital because he broke his neck?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They rode bulls together. (B) They decided to go to bed early.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They rode bulls together.\nExplanation: Riding bulls is a dangerous activity that can result in serious injuries, including broken bones and neck injuries. If Matt and Zack were participating in this activity together, it is plausible that Matt could have broken his neck and ended up in the hospital. On the other hand, going to bed early is not typically a dangerous activity that would result in a serious injury like a broken neck."}}
{"Q": "Oliver's bottle was dirty. Which event could cause When she was done, she gave him some water?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Oliver asked for help to clean her hands. (B) Mom took the bottle to the sink to get washed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Mom took the bottle to the sink to get washed.\nExplanation: If Oliver's bottle was dirty, it is more likely that someone would clean it before giving him water to drink. Option (A) suggests that Oliver needed help cleaning his hands, which is not directly related to the cleanliness of the bottle. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Oliver's mom noticed the dirty bottle and took it to the sink to wash it before giving him water."}}
{"Q": "Jim's son Joe is a great guitar player. Which event could cause He is proud of how good his son is at playing guitar?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe has not real friends. (B) Jim's son Joe played at a local coffee shop.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jim's son Joe played at a local coffee shop.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jim would be proud of his son's musical talent if he had the opportunity to showcase it in front of an audience, such as playing at a local coffee shop. Having no real friends would not necessarily be a cause for pride in his son's guitar playing ability."}}
{"Q": "Gretchen was feeling very sad as she walked to work one day. Which event could cause Gretchen felt happy because the prize cheered her up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She won a gift card for best performance. (B) She was hit and killed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She won a gift card for best performance.\nExplanation: Winning a prize or recognition for good performance can boost one's mood and make them feel happy. On the other hand, being hit and killed is a tragic event that would not cause happiness. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jackson was hungry for a milkshake. Which event could cause Jackson drank the delicious chocolate milkshake?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jackson blended a milkshake for his cousin. (B) Jackson put ice cream, syrup and milk in the blender.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jackson put ice cream, syrup and milk in the blender.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it involves Jackson actually making a milkshake with the necessary ingredients. Option A suggests that Jackson made a milkshake for his cousin, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he drank one himself. Option B, on the other hand, specifically mentions the ingredients needed to make a milkshake, which would satisfy Jackson's hunger for a milkshake."}}
{"Q": "It was the end of the semester, and Jake needed to study for finals. Which event could cause Jake spent that night studying so he was ready for his test?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jake turned down his friend's party invitation. (B) Jake was excited for his tests.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jake turned down his friend's party invitation.\nExplanation: If Jake turned down his friend's party invitation, it shows that he prioritizes his studies and is willing to sacrifice social events to prepare for his exams. This event is more plausible than Jake being excited for his tests, as most students feel anxious or stressed about exams rather than excited."}}
{"Q": "Timmy wanted to learn how to play video games. Which event could cause Unfortunately his older brother doesn't appreciate losing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Timmy lost to his older brother when they played. (B) He read a number of online how to manuals and learned how to beat his brother.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Timmy lost to his older brother when they played, it is plausible that his older brother may become upset or angry about losing and may not want to continue playing with Timmy. This could discourage Timmy from wanting to learn how to play video games or make it difficult for him to practice and improve his skills. On the other hand, if Timmy learned how to beat his brother by reading online manuals, this may actually impress his older brother and encourage him to continue playing with Timmy. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sadie had just gotten off from work. Which event could cause Nervous, she ran the rest of the way?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There was thunder and lighting up ahead. (B) Walking home, Sadie noticed no one was following her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) There was thunder and lighting up ahead.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sadie would run if she was nervous due to a potential danger, such as a thunderstorm with lightning, rather than feeling nervous because no one was following her. Running in the latter scenario would not necessarily alleviate her nervousness."}}
{"Q": "A man bought himself a rooster. Which event could cause It turns out they crow whenever they happen to feel like it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The rooster did not crow ever. (B) The man built a house for the rooster in the backyard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The rooster did not crow ever.\nExplanation: It is a well-known fact that roosters crow whenever they feel like it, especially during the early morning hours. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that building a house for the rooster would cause it to crow more or less frequently. On the other hand, if the rooster never crowed at all, it could be due to various reasons such as illness, stress, or simply being a quiet breed."}}
{"Q": "Mikey was desperately looking for work. Which event could cause He was so lucky to get some work?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided to send his daughter to many places. (B) He finally landed a job after several months.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He finally landed a job after several months.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mikey's luck changed when he finally found a job after several months of searching, rather than sending his daughter to many places. Finding a job is directly related to his own efforts and qualifications, while sending his daughter to many places may not have any direct impact on his job search."}}
{"Q": "Tara was camping by herself in the woods. Which event could cause She was able to successfully tap the hole shut?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tara tried to glue the hole. (B) Tara tried to tap the hole.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tara tried to tap the hole.\n\nExplanation: Tapping the hole shut is a common method used to fix leaks in pipes or containers. It involves using a tool to gently hammer a small piece of material, such as a wooden dowel or metal plug, into the hole to seal it. Gluing the hole shut would not be a practical solution as it would require a specific type of glue and may not hold up well under pressure or in wet conditions. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tara was able to successfully tap the hole shut."}}
{"Q": "Sameer was running late to work. Which event could cause The $200 ticket he got was a reminder to never jaywalk again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He ran across the road not at a light. (B) Sameer drove across the street in a hurry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: The $200 ticket for jaywalking suggests that Sameer was on foot and crossed the road not at a designated crosswalk or traffic light. This is a common reason for receiving a jaywalking ticket and is more plausible than Sameer driving across the street in a hurry, which would likely result in a different type of traffic violation."}}
{"Q": "Lucy and her grandma were leaving Blockbuster. Which event could cause He refused because once a day is enough?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy's brother didn't want to see another \"chick flick\" with her and their grandma. (B) Later that day Lucy asked her grandpa to take her back to school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The statement \"He refused because once a day is enough\" implies that someone has already watched a movie earlier that day. Option A is the most plausible answer as it suggests that Lucy and her grandma had already watched a movie with Lucy's brother earlier that day, and he did not want to watch another one. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any connection to the statement given."}}
{"Q": "Bill put his dog in the fence and went out for the night. Which event could cause Then he saw the lawn was filled with half-eaten mushrooms?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bill went out to get his dog. (B) He came back to an hindered fence gate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He came back to a hindered fence gate.\nExplanation: If Bill had gone out to get his dog, he would have noticed the hindered fence gate before leaving. However, if the fence gate was hindered, it would have allowed the dog to escape and roam around the lawn, eating half-eaten mushrooms. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Two best friends from Boston write a movie together. Which event could cause Their movies sell billions of dollars of tickets over the next 20 year?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Eventually they get someone to make the movie. (B) They work a little to get their movies in the theaters.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: While working to get their movies in theaters is important, it is not enough to guarantee billions of dollars in ticket sales over the next 20 years. Getting someone to make the movie, such as a major studio or production company, would provide the necessary resources and distribution to reach a wider audience and potentially become a blockbuster hit. Additionally, having a well-known director or actors attached to the project could also increase its appeal and success at the box office."}}
{"Q": "Jack went to the pet store after school. Which event could cause Jack was so sad he cried himself to sleep?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack pet one of the dogs and got bit. (B) Jack found out one of the pets he liked had babies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Jack got bit by one of the dogs, it could have caused him physical pain and emotional distress. This could have been a traumatic experience for him, leading to him being so sad that he cried himself to sleep. On the other hand, finding out that one of the pets he liked had babies may have been a happy event for Jack, rather than a sad one."}}
{"Q": "My roommate slams doors when he leaves a room. Which event could cause He agreed to at the end of the month?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The landlord requested that Steve move out. (B) I asked my roommate to make lots of jarring noises.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The landlord requested that Steve move out.\nExplanation: It is unlikely that someone would agree to make more noise after being asked to stop. On the other hand, if the landlord requested that Steve move out, he may have agreed to do so at the end of the month, which could explain his behavior. Perhaps he is frustrated with the situation and taking it out on the doors."}}
{"Q": "I took my girlfriend out to the restaurant. Which event could cause My girlfriend didn't have any money and I ended up paying for it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She forget her purse at home. (B) We ate and had to eat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If she forgot her purse at home, it is a plausible reason for her not having any money to pay for the meal. On the other hand, the second option (B) doesn't make sense as it implies that we had no choice but to eat and pay for the meal, which is not a valid reason for her not having any money."}}
{"Q": "The elementary school was have a father-daughter dance. Which event could cause It was the perfect first dance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ellie asked her dad to the concert and her dad agreed. She stood on his feet as he moved to the music. (B) So many fathers and daughters attended the dance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ellie asked her dad to the concert and her dad agreed. She stood on his feet as he moved to the music.\nExplanation: This event describes a father and daughter dancing together, which is the theme of the father-daughter dance. It also shows that the father and daughter have a close relationship and enjoy spending time together, making it a perfect first dance. Option B does not provide any information about a specific father-daughter dance and does not relate to the theme of the event."}}
{"Q": "Lina has two kids. Which event could cause Lina gave the clothes to charity?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her kids had a ton of clothes. (B) Lina's children ripped all of their clothes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Her kids had a ton of clothes.\nExplanation: If Lina's kids had a lot of clothes, it is possible that they outgrew them or no longer needed them. In this case, Lina may have decided to donate the clothes to charity to help those in need. On the other hand, if Lina's children ripped all of their clothes, it is unlikely that she would donate them to charity as they would be in poor condition."}}
{"Q": "Ynez decided on a whim to learn how to dance to a foxtrot. Which event could cause Ynez learned the dance from the internet instead?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ynez took a car in town but did not like having to go to it. (B) Ynez was going to learn from an instructor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ynez was going to learn from an instructor.\nExplanation: If Ynez had planned to learn from an instructor but then changed her mind and decided to learn from the internet instead, it would be a more plausible reason for her to do so. Taking a car in town and not liking it does not seem related to her decision to learn from the internet."}}
{"Q": "Ben decided to treat himself to a coffee. Which event could cause Ben was happy after getting the call from the bank?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ben was waiting to hear back about a coffee. (B) Ben was waiting to hear back about a job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Ben was waiting to hear back about a job and received a call from the bank, it is possible that the call was related to the job offer or salary negotiation. This could make Ben happy and lead him to treat himself to a coffee as a way of celebrating. On the other hand, if Ben was waiting to hear back about a coffee, it is unlikely that he would be particularly happy or excited about the call from the bank."}}
{"Q": "John was driving to work one day. Which event could cause Unfortunately, he ended up being late to work?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was an accident but cleared on the route that John was driving. (B) John decides to take a short cut through the city to save time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There was an accident but cleared on the route that John was driving.\nExplanation: If there was an accident on the route that John was driving, it could cause traffic congestion and delay his arrival to work. Even if the accident was cleared, there could still be residual traffic that would slow down his commute. On the other hand, taking a shortcut through the city could potentially save time, so it is less likely to be the cause of John being late to work."}}
{"Q": "The Stone family was on a bus headed towards the Great Pyramid. Which event could cause Upon arriving at the pyramids, the Stone family thanked the driver?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Stones car broke down and they had to call a taxi. (B) The Stone family got there late.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The Stones car broke down and they had to call a taxi.\nExplanation: If the Stone family's car broke down, they would have had to call a taxi or take public transportation to get to the Great Pyramid. In this case, they would have taken a bus and thanked the driver upon arriving at their destination. Option (B) is less plausible because if they got there late, they would have been in a rush and may not have had time to thank the driver."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to take a guy on a date. Which event could cause I'm really looking forward to it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I asked my neighbor out. (B) The guy I like said yes, he voted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The guy I like said yes, he voted.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it indicates that the person the individual is interested in has agreed to go on a date with them. This would naturally cause excitement and anticipation for the upcoming event. Option A, asking a neighbor out, may not necessarily elicit the same level of excitement or interest."}}
{"Q": "Sandy lived in New York. Which event could cause Sandy decided to go outside and make a snowman?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It snowed in New York. (B) It rained in New York.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It snowed in New York.\nExplanation: It is more plausible for Sandy to make a snowman if it snowed in New York. Snow is a common occurrence in New York during the winter season, and making a snowman is a popular activity for people of all ages. On the other hand, if it rained in New York, it would not be suitable for making a snowman as there would be no snow."}}
{"Q": "The sun was shining brightly and it was very warm. Which event could cause Startled and out of breath, Sue ran into her house?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Something was lurking in the little grass across the field. (B) Unexpectedly a bear came from the woods.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Something was lurking in the little grass across the field.\nExplanation: While it was warm and sunny outside, the presence of something lurking in the grass could startle Sue and cause her to run into her house out of breath. On the other hand, the sudden appearance of a bear from the woods seems less likely in a sunny and warm weather condition."}}
{"Q": "Becky was suspicious that someone was eating her cookies. Which event could cause Becky was surprised to find herself sleepwalking to them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Becky put her cookies under the camera to catch someone. (B) Becky put her cookies under the mattress to catch someone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Becky would set up a camera to catch the person eating her cookies, rather than hiding them under her mattress. It is also more likely that Becky would be surprised to find herself sleepwalking to the cookies if she had set up a camera, as she would have been actively trying to catch the culprit while awake. Hiding the cookies under the mattress would not necessarily lead to sleepwalking, and it would not be as surprising to find herself there since she put them there herself."}}
{"Q": "Jim found a stray cat walking on the street. Which event could cause Now, Jim's cat lives in Jim's house and it is his pet?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim decided to look for the owner and he found the owner. (B) Jim took it home and gave it a bath.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Jim found the owner of the cat, he would likely return the cat to its rightful owner rather than keeping it as his own pet. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jim decided to keep the cat as his pet after failing to find its owner."}}
{"Q": "Mr Qu was a famous statesman from China. Which event could cause He ended up being voted Man of the Year?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mr. Qu gave back to the community. (B) Mr. Qu was know throughout the company for his greed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mr. Qu was voted Man of the Year for giving back to the community, as this is a positive and admirable trait for a statesman. Being known for greed, as in option B, would not typically lead to such an honor."}}
{"Q": "Liz was babysitting a 5 year old boy. Which event could cause When she heard him giggling from a closet, Liz was relieved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Liz was playing hide and seek and found the boy. (B) The boy ran from Liz crying and hid.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Liz was playing hide and seek and found the boy.\nExplanation: If Liz was playing hide and seek with the boy, it would be expected for him to hide in a closet and giggle when found. This would be a normal and harmless situation, which would explain why Liz was relieved. On the other hand, if the boy ran from Liz crying and hid, it would be a cause for concern and Liz would not be relieved."}}
{"Q": "A group of friends went to a restaurant. Which event could cause The meals were worth the wait because it was the best quality?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They sat there for an hour. (B) the food was really made fast.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) They sat there for an hour.\nExplanation: If the group of friends had to wait for an hour to get their meals, it could mean that the restaurant was busy and the kitchen was taking their time to prepare the food. This could also mean that the food was cooked fresh and with care, resulting in high-quality meals that were worth the wait. On the other hand, if the food was made really fast (option B), it may not necessarily mean that it was of the best quality."}}
{"Q": "I had pancakes for breakfast today. Which event could cause So long blueberries, we had a good time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had them without the fruit topping and they were surprisingly delicious. (B) I used the abundance of our blueberries we have with them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I used the abundance of our blueberries we have with them.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly involves blueberries, which is the subject of the statement \"So long blueberries, we had a good time.\" If the speaker used up all the blueberries they had with their pancakes, it would make sense for them to say goodbye to the fruit in a playful way. Option (A) does not involve blueberries at all, so it is less likely to be the cause of the statement."}}
{"Q": "James realizes he hasn't left his home in days. Which event could cause James is still happy that he has at least left the house?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) James ran out of groceries but didn't go to the store. (B) James left and had nowhere to go.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) James ran out of groceries but didn't go to the store.\n\nExplanation: This event could cause James to feel happy that he has at least left the house because it means he had a reason to leave and it was for a necessary task like getting groceries. Even though he didn't go out for leisure or socializing, he still had a purpose for leaving the house and accomplishing something."}}
{"Q": "Marsha had just moved in with her husband. Which event could cause Marsha was elated?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Marsha bought her husband flowers when she got home. (B) Marsha discovered that an old friend lived in the neighborhood as she introduced herself to the neighbors.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Marsha discovered that an old friend lived in the neighborhood as she introduced herself to the neighbors.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause Marsha to feel elated because it involves reconnecting with an old friend, which can bring feelings of happiness and excitement. Buying her husband flowers may also make her happy, but it is not as significant as reconnecting with a friend."}}
{"Q": "The little boy brought his bike home. Which event could cause His mother felt terrible when she saw the helmet strap was broken?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) his mother ran over his helmet in the driveway. (B) He had to walk because he got a flat tire.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. his mother ran over his helmet in the driveway.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because if the mother ran over the helmet, it could have caused damage to the strap. On the other hand, getting a flat tire would not necessarily cause damage to the helmet strap."}}
{"Q": "Kate was at Summer camp. Which event could cause She screeched and climbed out of the water?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She went for a swim. (B) Kate saw a big fish in the lake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kate saw a big fish in the lake.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kate would screech and climb out of the water if she saw a big fish in the lake, as opposed to simply going for a swim. Seeing a big fish could startle her and cause her to react in such a way."}}
{"Q": "David's dad bought a new television. Which event could cause The television can not be returned?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was broken when Dad dropped it. (B) The television stopped working after the return date.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The television stopped working after the return date.\nExplanation: If the television was broken when Dad dropped it, it would likely be covered under the warranty or return policy. However, if the television stopped working after the return date, the store may not accept the return as it would be considered outside of the return window. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Fred applied for a new job. Which event could cause He just gave up on the job because he didn't know where to look?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He hadn't heard anything from any employers. (B) The interviewer couldn't find the interview location.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He hadn't heard anything from any employers.\nExplanation: If Fred hadn't heard anything from any employers, it could be a discouraging factor for him to continue his job search. He may feel like he's not making any progress and may give up on the job search altogether. On the other hand, if the interviewer couldn't find the interview location, Fred could have simply rescheduled the interview or provided directions to the location. It's less likely that this event would cause him to give up on the job entirely."}}
{"Q": "Dave had entered a raffle at work this past weekend. Which event could cause The winners were announced, and Dave had won the top prize?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dave told his co-workers that if he won, he would buy them all lunch for a week. (B) Steve told his co-workers that if he won, he would buy them all lunch for a week.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Dave winning the top prize is a plausible event because it is directly related to the raffle. On the other hand, Steve's statement about buying lunch for his co-workers does not have any impact on the outcome of the raffle and is therefore not a plausible cause for Dave winning the top prize."}}
{"Q": "Bill was an attractive man. Which event could cause He felt and looked much better after shaving?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bill was out to make an impression on a new boss. (B) Bill grew a beard, but felt less attractive with it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If Bill was out to make an impression on a new boss, he would want to look his best and may have felt that shaving would improve his appearance. On the other hand, if Bill grew a beard but felt less attractive with it, shaving may not necessarily make him feel and look much better. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Emily was looking for something in her brother's room. Which event could cause Emily got in big trouble with her mom?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Emily's brother told on her. (B) Emily went through her brother's drawer, but left before her mom could catch her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Emily's brother told on her.\nExplanation: If Emily's brother tells on her, her mom will find out that she was in his room without permission. This could lead to Emily getting in trouble with her mom for invading her brother's privacy and not respecting his personal space. On the other hand, if Emily left before her mom could catch her, she may not get in trouble at all. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The Levins owned a small corner store. Which event could cause They made more than enough money to take a cab whenever they wanted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Levins had many bugs. (B) Levin was very successful at running the store.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Levin was very successful at running the store.\nExplanation: If Levin was successful at running the store, it would mean that the store was making a good profit. This would allow the Levins to have more disposable income and be able to afford luxuries like taking a cab whenever they wanted. On the other hand, having many bugs in the store would likely drive away customers and decrease profits, making it less likely for the Levins to have extra money for such expenses. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ana didn't like dogs and never had. Which event could cause She and her husband went out to buy a dog as soon as they could?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ana decided to never change her mind. (B) One day when Anna was about to be attacked by a mugger dog came out of nowhere and attacked him 1st.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a traumatic event, such as being attacked by a mugger and being saved by a dog, could change Ana's perspective on dogs and make her want to get one for protection or companionship. It is less likely that Ana would suddenly change her mind about dogs without a significant event or experience."}}
{"Q": "Last night I had to be home in time for the new episode I had to watch Which event could cause I couldn't wait for the new one the following week?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was very exciting and there was a cliff hanger. (B) I really hated this week's episode.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the episode was very exciting and ended with a cliffhanger, it would make sense for the person to not want to wait a week to find out what happens next. This is a common reason why people prioritize watching certain TV shows or episodes. On the other hand, if the person hated the episode, they would likely not be as invested in the show and may not feel the need to watch the next episode right away."}}
{"Q": "Ed was visiting California. Which event could cause But gradually, he got a little better at surfing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) At first, Ed could not buy a surfboard. (B) Ed tried surfing for the first time and loved it so much he kept trying.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ed's love for surfing and determination to improve gradually led to him getting better at it, rather than not being able to buy a surfboard initially. Trying something for the first time and enjoying it can often lead to a desire to improve and master the skill."}}
{"Q": "Millie enjoyed playing peek-a-boo. Which event could cause Millie's excitement about her new friend lasted until nap time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Millie was playing peek-a-boo with a friend. (B) Millie invited her dog over to play.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Millie was playing peek-a-boo with a friend.\nExplanation: Since Millie enjoys playing peek-a-boo, it is more plausible that her excitement would last until nap time if she was playing with a friend rather than inviting her dog over to play. Dogs may not be able to play peek-a-boo in the same way as humans, and their attention span may not be as long as a human friend's. Therefore, it is more likely that playing with a friend would keep Millie excited and engaged until nap time."}}
{"Q": "Tyler's kids were getting too much screen time. Which event could cause Everyone seemed much happier?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tyler decided to entertain his kids another way - with a movie party. (B) Someone complained to the teacher.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Tyler decided to entertain his kids another way - with a movie party.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Tyler took proactive steps to reduce his kids' screen time and provide them with a fun alternative activity. By organizing a movie party, Tyler could engage his kids in a social and interactive activity that would distract them from their screens and promote family bonding. This could lead to a happier and more fulfilling experience for everyone involved. On the other hand, someone complaining to the teacher may not necessarily lead to a solution that would make everyone happier, as it could create tension and conflict between Tyler's family and the school."}}
{"Q": "Steve had a lot of parking tickets. Which event could cause Steve, dejected, resolved to be more careful in the future?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He refused to pay them all. (B) There was a boot put on his car.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There was a boot put on his car.\nExplanation: Having a boot put on his car would be a more plausible event that could cause Steve to feel dejected and resolved to be more careful in the future. This is because having a boot put on his car would prevent him from being able to drive it until he paid off his parking tickets, which could be a frustrating and inconvenient experience. It would also serve as a clear consequence for his actions, making him more likely to take parking regulations seriously in the future. Refusing to pay the tickets would not necessarily have the same impact on Steve's behavior, as he could continue to park illegally without facing any immediate consequences."}}
{"Q": "Tim was painting. Which event could cause Until he decided to paint a pretty picture on his shirt?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He decided he wanted to make it more personal and the teacher was ok with it. (B) Tim hated the new colors of paint his mother had bought him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tim hated the new colors of paint his mother had bought him.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it provides a reason for Tim to paint on his shirt. If Tim didn't like the new colors of paint his mother had bought him, he may have been frustrated or upset and decided to take it out on his shirt by painting on it. On the other hand, it is unlikely that a teacher would allow a student to paint on their shirt during class, making option (A) less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Ezekiel was herding his sheep one fall evening. Which event could cause Ezekiel jumped from the hide and stabbed the wolf in the neck?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ezeikiel noticed there wasn't a wolf trying to attack his sheep. (B) A wolf appeared near the sheep.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ezekiel would jump from the hide and stab the wolf in the neck if a wolf appeared near the sheep, as this would be a threat to his flock and his livelihood. If there was no wolf present, there would be no reason for Ezekiel to take such drastic action."}}
{"Q": "My friend introduced me to a close friend of his. Which event could cause When I decided to ask, she barely had anything to say?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I thought this person was one who stole from me before. (B) She turned out to be very chatty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If the person being introduced was someone who the asker thought had stolen from them before, it would likely create an uncomfortable and awkward situation, causing the person to be hesitant to engage in conversation. This could lead to the person having very little to say when asked questions. On the other hand, if the person turned out to be very chatty, it would not explain why they barely had anything to say when asked. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The Goetschius family moved to the Outer Banks. Which event could cause They ended up really enjoying their new home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Goetschius family enjoys peace. (B) They planned to build a house next year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The Goetschius family enjoys peace.\n\nExplanation: The fact that the Goetschius family ended up really enjoying their new home suggests that they found something about their new environment that they liked. Since they moved to the Outer Banks, which is known for its natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere, it is more likely that they enjoyed the peace and tranquility of their new surroundings rather than planning to build a house next year. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Amy decided to cook quinoa for her dinner. Which event could cause Amy realized she needed to learn how to season food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The pie ended up tasting plain. (B) Amy food tasted plain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Amy's food tasted plain.\n\nExplanation: If Amy's quinoa tasted plain, it would be a more plausible reason for her to realize she needs to learn how to season food. The taste of her own food would be a more immediate and personal experience for her, compared to the taste of a pie that she may not have been involved in making. This experience would prompt her to seek ways to improve the flavor of her dishes, such as learning how to season them properly."}}
{"Q": "Franklin wanted to send a birthday card to his grandmother. Which event could cause Franklin dropped the envelope into the mailbox?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Franklin prepared the note and envelope. (B) Franklin addressed the package and sent it yesterday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: If Franklin already addressed the package and sent it yesterday, it is more likely that he accidentally dropped the envelope into the mailbox while trying to put it in. If he had just prepared the note and envelope, he would still have to address it and send it, so it is less likely that he would have accidentally dropped it into the mailbox at that point."}}
{"Q": "Noah had a cold. Which event could cause After two days, Noah felt better?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Noah ate cold cuts and got a lot of rest. (B) Noah took his prescribed medicine and stayed home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that taking prescribed medicine and staying home would help Noah recover from his cold, rather than eating cold cuts and getting rest alone. Prescribed medicine can help alleviate symptoms and fight off the virus causing the cold, while staying home can prevent the spread of the illness and allow Noah's body to rest and recover."}}
{"Q": "Kayla went for a manicure. Which event could cause She left with a beautiful nails and complete satisfaction?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor was very diligent and didn't overlook any detail. (B) Kayla tried a new nail shop.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor was very diligent and didn't overlook any detail.\nExplanation: If the doctor was very diligent and paid attention to every detail during the manicure, it is likely that Kayla would leave with beautiful nails and complete satisfaction. This shows that the quality of the service provided was high, which is a key factor in customer satisfaction. On the other hand, trying a new nail shop may or may not result in a satisfactory experience, as the quality of service can vary greatly between different shops. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Joe went to college for art. Which event could cause Then he got hired?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He graduated with a degree and decided to apply for a job as an art teacher. (B) He didn't graduate, but decided to apply for a job as an art teacher.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He graduated with a degree and decided to apply for a job as an art teacher.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe would need to graduate with a degree in art before being hired for a job in the field. Many employers require a degree or some form of formal education in the subject area before considering a candidate for a position. Additionally, becoming an art teacher typically requires a teaching certification, which would also require a degree. Therefore, it is more likely that Joe would need to graduate with a degree before being hired as an art teacher."}}
{"Q": "Roan and his family ate a lot of fruits and veggies. Which event could cause Roan was glad he had come up with such a 'green' idea?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Roan thought they should invest in a kitchen garden and grow some fruits and veggies. (B) Roan thought they should invest in a kitchen garden and grow some flowers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Roan thought they should invest in a kitchen garden and grow some fruits and veggies.\n\nExplanation: Since Roan and his family ate a lot of fruits and veggies, it would make sense for him to be glad that he came up with the idea of investing in a kitchen garden to grow their own produce. This would not only provide them with fresh and healthy food but also save them money in the long run. On the other hand, investing in a kitchen garden to grow flowers would not have the same practical benefits for their diet and health."}}
{"Q": "Ed was starving when his dad handed him his ham sandwich. Which event could cause His dad shared his sandwich with him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ed's dad was hungry. (B) Ed asked his dad her some of the sandwich.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ed's dad was hungry.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ed's dad shared his sandwich with him because he himself was hungry and wanted to share his food with his son. It is less likely that Ed asked for some of the sandwich, as the sentence implies that his dad handed him the sandwich without being prompted."}}
{"Q": "Jay went to pick up his mail. Which event could cause Jay looked at it and pick it up with great effort?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He opened the door, finding one postcard. (B) Jay dropped his mail on the ground and it went all over.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jay dropped his mail on the ground and it went all over.\nExplanation: If Jay dropped his mail on the ground and it went all over, he would have to pick it up with great effort. This is because he would have to bend down and collect all the scattered mail, which could be a physically demanding task. On the other hand, finding one postcard when he opened the door would not require much effort to pick up. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Georgia was checking her email. Which event could cause Finally, she had a clean empty inbox?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Georgia hasn't kept any of her emails in a year. (B) Georgia deleted the messages as she read them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Georgia deleted the messages as she read them.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Georgia actively deleted her emails as she read them, rather than not keeping any emails for a year. This is a common practice for people who like to keep their inbox clean and organized. By deleting emails as she reads them, Georgia can ensure that her inbox stays empty and clutter-free."}}
{"Q": "Sam and his wife were busy packing for their trip. Which event could cause Sam and his wife had a great time together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam and his wife had a great time packing for their trip. (B) Sam and his wife went on a cruise.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Sam and his wife went on a cruise.\n\nExplanation: Going on a cruise is a leisure activity that is often associated with relaxation, adventure, and spending quality time with loved ones. Therefore, it is more plausible that Sam and his wife would have a great time together while on a cruise rather than just packing for their trip. While packing can be a necessary task, it is not typically an event that would lead to a great time together."}}
{"Q": "Loudoun decided it was time to purchase a new microphone. Which event could cause Loudoun felt great joy as he listened to himself through his new mic?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Loudoun bought a good grilled cheese. (B) Loudoun went to the store and picked up a great new mic and brought it home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Loudoun would feel great joy from listening to himself through his new microphone, as it is a new and improved tool for his work or hobby. Buying a good grilled cheese may bring him satisfaction or pleasure, but it is unlikely to cause great joy in the same way as a new microphone."}}
{"Q": "One day a salesman came by my office. Which event could cause It sold for $20?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The salesman was selling a vacuum cleaner. (B) The salesman showed me a new car for his company.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a salesman selling a vacuum cleaner would sell it for $20, as vacuum cleaners are typically priced in that range. A new car would be significantly more expensive and would not be sold for $20."}}
{"Q": "Larry was running late for work. Which event could cause He had gotten the wrong one in his hurry?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He picked out a tie as he was running out of the door. (B) He make sure he get the correct tie as he was running out of the door.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Larry picked out a tie quickly without paying close attention to which one he grabbed, rather than taking the time to make sure he got the correct one while in a hurry. This is a common mistake people make when rushing out the door."}}
{"Q": "Rachel won a free skydiving trip. Which event could cause Her instructor teased Rachel as she floated far down?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rachel was not afraid to do it. (B) She took a test dive in an air tunnel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rachel was not afraid to do it.\nExplanation: If Rachel was not afraid to do the skydiving, it is possible that her instructor teased her as she floated far down as a way to lighten the mood and make the experience more enjoyable. On the other hand, if Rachel had taken a test dive in an air tunnel, it would not necessarily lead to her instructor teasing her during the actual skydiving experience. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Grandma always enjoyed knitting. Which event could cause Grandma put the knitting kit to good use?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Grandma got us a kit for Christmas. (B) Grandma saw I had a hole in my jeans.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If Grandma saw that someone had a hole in their jeans, it would be a practical reason for her to use her knitting kit to mend the hole. Getting a knitting kit for Christmas may be a reason for her to start knitting, but it doesn't necessarily mean she would put it to use right away."}}
{"Q": "Daria wanted a new sweater. Which event could cause She found a beautiful sweater and ordered it right away?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She used the internet to find the perfect sweater. (B) She went all around town to find a sweater.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Daria used the internet to find the perfect sweater, it is more likely that she found a beautiful sweater and ordered it right away. Online shopping allows for a wider range of options and the ability to quickly make a purchase without having to physically go to different stores. Going all around town to find a sweater would be a more time-consuming and less efficient way to shop, making it less likely that she would find a sweater she loved and ordered it right away."}}
{"Q": "Toby was the Sullivan family's very first dog. Which event could cause Toby lived until he was 16 years old?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Sullivan's treated Toby like a family member. (B) The Sullivan's treated Toby like a family member for 2 years.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The Sullivan's treated Toby like a family member.\n\nExplanation: Dogs that are treated like family members tend to live longer and have better health outcomes. This is because they receive proper care, attention, and love from their owners. The Sullivan family treating Toby like a family member for his entire life would have contributed to his longevity and overall well-being. On the other hand, treating him like a family member for only 2 years would not have had as significant of an impact on his lifespan."}}
{"Q": "My work as a janitor keeps me busy throughout the day. Which event could cause Lastly, I clean floors with a vacuum cleaner?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I have a full schedule to follow: emptying trash, cleaning restrooms, dusting, refilling containers. (B) I mop all of the floors first.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If the janitor has a full schedule to follow, it is more likely that they would prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency. Vacuuming the floors would be one of the last tasks on the list, hence the name \"Lastly\". Mopping the floors first would not make sense as it would create more work for the janitor by getting the floors wet again after they have been vacuumed."}}
{"Q": "Sally went to the pet store the other day. Which event could cause Sally now has a goldfish named Puppy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sally looked at the fish tanks and wanted one. (B) Sally wanted a pet that required lots of care.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Sally saw the goldfish in the fish tanks and decided she wanted one as a pet. Goldfish are relatively low-maintenance pets, so it is unlikely that Sally specifically wanted a pet that required lots of care."}}
{"Q": "Last night my girlfriend and I got into a fight. Which event could cause She hasn't answered my calls all day today her profile says single?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She stormed out of my dump and I didn't talk to her all night. (B) She stormed out of my house and I didn't talk to her all night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She stormed out of my house and I didn't talk to her all night.\nExplanation: If she stormed out of the house and didn't talk to you all night, it's possible that she's still upset and needs some space. Her not answering your calls and changing her profile to single could be a sign that she's considering ending the relationship. It's important to give her some time and space to cool off before trying to reach out to her again."}}
{"Q": "I did not know Doug's wife's name so I asked him. Which event could cause Finally I looked at Dougs wife death certificate and learned her name?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Doug allowed me to look through some paperwork. (B) Doug told me her wife is dead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Doug told me her wife is dead.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Doug would have mentioned his wife's death and her name during the conversation when asked about her name. It is not very common for someone to allow another person to look through their personal paperwork, especially related to a deceased loved one. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ben liked to play around with animals. Which event could cause The dog bit Ben because he was being rough with him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben found a new dog. (B) Ben started stroking a dog a little too gently.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ben started stroking a dog a little too gently.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Ben liked to play around with animals, which suggests that he may have been rough or playful with them. If he started stroking a dog too gently, it is possible that the dog may have become uncomfortable or agitated, leading to a bite. Finding a new dog would not necessarily lead to a bite, as the dog's behavior would depend on how Ben interacted with it."}}
{"Q": "Petey liked to cook. Which event could cause Petey's wife was thrilled?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Petey uneducated new dishes. (B) Petey cooked dinner that night instead of his wife.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Petey's wife would be thrilled if Petey cooked dinner that night instead of her because it would give her a break from cooking and allow her to relax. Petey cooking new dishes may also be exciting, but it is not necessarily a guarantee that his wife would be thrilled."}}
{"Q": "Nay wanted a pet but she was allergic to cats. Which event could cause She got four fish and loved watching them every day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nay researched what pets would be good for people allergic to cats. (B) Nay decided to get something other than a fish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Nay researched what pets would be good for people allergic to cats.\nExplanation: Since Nay was allergic to cats, it is unlikely that she would have decided to get a cat or any other pet that could trigger her allergies. Therefore, it is more plausible that she would have researched what pets would be suitable for people with allergies and found that fish were a good option. This led her to get four fish and enjoy watching them every day."}}
{"Q": "Chloe got tickets for an upcoming hockey game. Which event could cause Chloe's team won and she took home an extra souvenir?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Chloe went to the game and cheered on her team. (B) Chloe went to the hockey game and caught a puck.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Chloe went to the game and cheered on her team.\nExplanation: While it is possible for Chloe to catch a puck at the hockey game, it is not a common occurrence and requires a certain level of luck and skill. On the other hand, if Chloe's team won the game, it is likely that there were souvenirs or merchandise available for purchase or given away to fans. Additionally, cheering on her team and showing support can also be a rewarding experience for Chloe. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lois was often bullied at his elementary school. Which event could cause Now Lois is learning well and much happier?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lois got help from an adult to solve the problem when his grades started dropping. (B) The bullies finally stood up to Lois.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lois got help from an adult to solve the problem when his grades started dropping.\n\nExplanation: Getting help from an adult to solve the bullying problem would address the root cause of Lois's unhappiness and poor academic performance. It would also provide Lois with the necessary support and resources to cope with the bullying and improve his overall well-being. On the other hand, the bullies standing up to Lois would likely exacerbate the situation and make him feel even more isolated and unhappy. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lucy ordered some pizza. Which event could cause Lucy had to heat it up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When it got to Lucy it was cold. (B) When the pizza arrived it was hot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If the pizza arrived cold, it is more plausible that Lucy would have to heat it up to make it enjoyable to eat. If the pizza arrived hot, there would be no need for Lucy to heat it up."}}
{"Q": "Gina drove past the dry ski slope near her home. Which event could cause Just then she saw a large machine spraying fake snow on the slope?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gina wanted to go skiing as soon as she could. (B) How Gina wished it would rain so she could get wet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Gina wanted to go skiing as soon as she could.\nExplanation: The fact that Gina saw a machine spraying fake snow on the dry ski slope suggests that the slope is now ready for skiing. Therefore, it is more plausible that Gina would want to go skiing as soon as she could rather than wishing for rain to get wet, which is not related to skiing."}}
{"Q": "Jason had always admired the fast movements of boxers he saw on TV. Which event could cause His wrestling matches were very exciting?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He used some of the footwork to use in his wrestling. (B) He used some of the work to rest his foot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He used some of the footwork to use in his wrestling.\nExplanation: Since Jason admired the fast movements of boxers, it is likely that he tried to incorporate some of their techniques into his own wrestling style. Using footwork from boxing could have helped him move quickly and unpredictably on the wrestling mat, making his matches more exciting. On the other hand, using boxing techniques to rest his foot (option B) does not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Tom decided to go skiing in a snowstorm. Which event could cause He had a cup of hot chocolate with his friends at the lodge?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) tom got stranded but got rescued by his friends. (B) It was bad but it was too cold for Tom so they stayed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It was bad but it was too cold for Tom so they stayed.\n\nExplanation: If Tom decided to go skiing in a snowstorm, it is likely that he would still go skiing despite the weather conditions. However, if it was too cold for him, he may have decided to stay at the lodge with his friends and have a cup of hot chocolate. This event would not necessarily lead to him getting stranded or needing to be rescued by his friends, making option (A) less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Jill and Lisa had been best friends for years. Which event could cause Lisa was so upset?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was really rude to her. (B) Lisa was really rude to Jill.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was really rude to her.\nExplanation: If Lisa was really rude to Jill, it would not make sense for Lisa to be upset. However, if Jill was really rude to Lisa, it could cause Lisa to be upset and potentially damage their friendship."}}
{"Q": "Amy was at the grocery store shopping for the week. Which event could cause Amy had to chase lemons half way across the parking lot?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She spilled one of her grocery bags at checkout before paying. (B) Amy's bag broke in half.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Amy's bag broke in half.\nExplanation: If Amy's bag broke in half, it is plausible that the lemons fell out and rolled away, causing her to chase after them. On the other hand, if she spilled one of her grocery bags at checkout before paying, it is unlikely that the lemons would have rolled all the way to the parking lot before she noticed and picked them up."}}
{"Q": "Mary was signed up for a secret santa. Which event could cause She had it sent to her match?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary went to the store for a makeup kit. (B) Mary was evil and put rattlesnakes in her gift-box.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mary went to the store for a makeup kit.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary simply went to the store to purchase a gift for her secret santa match and had it sent directly to them, rather than intentionally putting dangerous animals in the gift-box. Going to the store to purchase a makeup kit is a common and harmless activity, making it a more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "Bill wouldn't stop playing violent video games around his son. Which event could cause Bill reluctantly stopped playing the games?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) One day his boy bashed his friend over the head with a rock. (B) Bill saw his son reenact a violent sex scene.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bill would stop playing violent video games around his son if his son were to imitate the violent behavior he saw in the games and harm someone. Seeing his son reenact a violent sex scene, while disturbing, may not necessarily be enough to make Bill stop playing the games. However, witnessing his son cause harm to someone else would likely make Bill realize the negative impact the games could have on his child and prompt him to make a change."}}
{"Q": "Trish was happy to have both of her daughter's home at once. Which event could cause Trish went to bed very happy that night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Trish had seen one of her daughters recently since she was off to college. (B) Trish had not seen one of her daughters in a long time since she was off to college.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Trish had not seen one of her daughters in a long time since she was off to college.\n\nExplanation: If Trish had not seen one of her daughters in a long time, it would be a special occasion for both of her daughters to be home at the same time. This would make Trish very happy and grateful to have both of her daughters together. On the other hand, if Trish had seen one of her daughters recently, it would not be as significant of an event for both of her daughters to be home at the same time."}}
{"Q": "We gathered for the office Christmas party. Which event could cause The night was a great time and everyone was happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Everybody exchanged birthday presents. (B) We worked hard to prepare for the party.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. We worked hard to prepare for the party.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the effort put into preparing for the party, such as decorating, planning activities, and providing food and drinks, contributed to the success of the event and the happiness of the attendees. Exchanging birthday presents, while a nice gesture, would not necessarily have the same impact on the overall mood of the party."}}
{"Q": "Billy's family just moved to a new city. Which event could cause They became great friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bill instantly made friends with the neighbor that lived three houses down. (B) Billy met his neighbor Jimmy on his last day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Billy becoming great friends with a neighbor who lived three houses down would lead to a strong friendship, as they would likely have more opportunities to interact and get to know each other. Meeting someone on the last day before moving away would not provide enough time to develop a strong friendship."}}
{"Q": "Larry was playing basketball. Which event could cause The river carried his basketball all the way down the stream?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He dropped the basketball and it rolled down the hill. (B) It began to snow heavily, and soon the park was covered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Larry dropped the basketball and it rolled down the hill, it could have ended up in a nearby stream or river, which could have carried it downstream. On the other hand, snowfall would not have any direct impact on the basketball's movement, and it is unlikely that it would end up in a river solely due to snowfall. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Anna was babysitting her young cousins. Which event could cause Anna kept them amused all day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anna brought a bag filled with arts and crafts. (B) Anna made funny faces at the dogs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Anna brought a bag filled with arts and crafts.\nExplanation: Bringing a bag filled with arts and crafts is a more plausible answer as it provides a variety of activities for the children to engage in and keeps them occupied for a longer period of time. Making funny faces at the dogs may be entertaining for a short while, but it is not a sustainable activity to keep the children amused all day."}}
{"Q": "I was talking to my neighbor this morning. Which event could cause The cat had been following me and got inside my house?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I didn't notice the deceased cat outside while I was talking. (B) I left my neighbors gate open.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I left my neighbors gate open.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cat got inside the house because the neighbor left their gate open, allowing the cat to wander in. It is less likely that the presence of a deceased cat outside would cause the cat to follow the speaker and enter their house."}}
{"Q": "Joann was making lemon cupcakes. Which event could cause They came out with an awkward texture?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joan added too much baking soda. (B) Joann forgot to add baking soda.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Joann added too much baking soda.\nExplanation: Adding too much baking soda can cause the cupcakes to rise too quickly and then collapse, resulting in an awkward texture. This is a common mistake in baking and can easily happen if the measurements are not precise. Forgetting to add baking soda would result in a dense and flat cupcake, but not necessarily an awkward texture."}}
{"Q": "Every Wednesday Mark was at the baseball fields. Which event could cause Mark never ate a hotdog again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mark loved hotdogs, but he was losing too much weight. (B) Mark got food poisoning from a hotdog at the ballpark.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Mark got food poisoning from a hotdog at the ballpark.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Mark's regular activity of going to the baseball fields every Wednesday. It is also a common occurrence for people to get food poisoning from consuming food at public events, especially if the food is not prepared or stored properly. Additionally, the experience of getting sick from a hotdog could be traumatic enough for Mark to never want to eat one again."}}
{"Q": "My trumpet teacher was amazing. Which event could cause All of his examples were really funny?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He gave very serious instructions for everything he taught. (B) He gave explicit instructions for everything he taught.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He gave very serious instructions for everything he taught.\n\nExplanation: It is more likely that a teacher who gives very serious instructions for everything he taught would use humor to lighten the mood and make the lessons more enjoyable. This is a common teaching technique to keep students engaged and interested in the material. On the other hand, giving explicit instructions does not necessarily lead to funny examples."}}
{"Q": "My son told me about making a little extra money in my spare time. Which event could cause Now I turk almost every day and am making a lot of extra money?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My son said it was called Mechanical Turk and it's run by Amazon so I know it's legitimate. (B) He hooked me down with a turk job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the individual would trust their son's recommendation of a legitimate platform like Mechanical Turk, which is run by a well-known company like Amazon, rather than simply being \"hooked up\" with a job without any further explanation or context. Additionally, the statement \"Now I turk almost every day and am making a lot of extra money\" suggests that the individual has been consistently using the platform, which is more likely if they were introduced to it by a trusted source like their son."}}
{"Q": "I forgot to set my alarm last night. Which event could cause Luckily I'm a good worker and got one more chance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was early for work this morning. (B) I ended up being late to work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I was early for work this morning.\nExplanation: If the person is a good worker and got one more chance, it is more likely that they woke up early and made it to work on time, rather than being late. Being early shows responsibility and dedication to their job, which aligns with the statement that they are a good worker."}}
{"Q": "Pat really hated Ben. Which event could cause Now Ben will never wear gloves again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Pat started wearing gloves as winter set in. (B) Ben slapped Pat with a glove.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ben slapped Pat with a glove.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause Ben to never wear gloves again because it involves a negative interaction between Pat and Ben. If Pat started wearing gloves, it would not necessarily have any impact on Ben's decision to wear gloves. However, if Ben was slapped with a glove by Pat, he may associate gloves with that negative experience and choose not to wear them again."}}
{"Q": "I put the black plastic rose in a vase with water. Which event could cause Honestly, I didn't really know why either?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was thinking about other things and didn't realize I didn't do it yet. (B) My friend asked me why I put a plastic rose in the vase.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person simply forgot to remove the plastic rose from the vase before adding water, rather than intentionally putting it in there without realizing it was plastic. This could happen if they were distracted or preoccupied with other thoughts. Option B is less likely as it implies that the person intentionally put the plastic rose in the vase without knowing why, which is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Ron and his friends were hanging out late at night. Which event could cause Ron said he didn't want to and his friends made fun of him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ron decided to go home so he could rest before work the next day. (B) Ron's friends dared Ron to stay inside.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ron's friends dared Ron to stay inside.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ron's friends would make fun of him if he refused to do something they dared him to do, rather than if he decided to go home to rest before work. Peer pressure and dares are common among groups of friends, especially late at night when they may be more likely to engage in risky behavior. Ron's refusal to participate in a dare could be seen as a sign of weakness or lack of fun, leading his friends to make fun of him."}}
{"Q": "Jim wanted a new kitchen sink. Which event could cause Then he took some time to admire his new sink?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim went to the night club. (B) Jim hired a plumber to install a farmhouse sink.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jim hired a plumber to install a farmhouse sink.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jim would take time to admire his new sink after having it installed by a professional plumber. Going to a night club has no connection to getting a new kitchen sink."}}
{"Q": "My husband Jim died of cancer last year on Valentine's Day. Which event could cause Her loving father left a final love letter in their favorite book?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim wanted to leave his wife a lasting memento. (B) My daughter moved out of her room.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jim wanted to leave his wife a lasting memento.\nExplanation: Given the context of the question, it is more plausible that the event of Jim's death would lead to his desire to leave his wife a lasting memento, such as a love letter. On the other hand, the event of the daughter moving out of her room does not seem to have any direct connection to the father leaving a love letter in their favorite book."}}
{"Q": "Garth woke up and pounded the alarm clock into silence. Which event could cause He called 911, but there wasn't anything they could do?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Garth felt something cold next to him. (B) Garth broke his phone and didn't know the time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Garth felt something cold next to him.\nExplanation: This event suggests that Garth may have woken up to find a dead body or a significant injury next to him, which could cause him to panic and call 911. On the other hand, option B is less likely to cause such a severe reaction as breaking a phone is not an emergency situation."}}
{"Q": "Mark wrote horror stories for a living, and he took great pride in it. Which event could cause Mark woke up to the sound of his alarm clock in tears?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He fell asleep by accident before he finished his story in time. (B) Mark's stories gave him nightmares.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He fell asleep by accident before he finished his story in time.\nExplanation: Mark takes great pride in his work as a horror story writer, so it is unlikely that his own stories would give him nightmares. However, if he fell asleep before finishing his story in time, he may have missed a deadline or lost an opportunity to publish his work, causing him to wake up in tears due to the stress and disappointment."}}
{"Q": "I stopped taking my prescribed pills because they made sick. Which event could cause I told the doctor his pills made me sick so i stopped taking them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I went to the doctor to discuss my pills. (B) I missed my appointment with my doctor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I went to the doctor to discuss my pills.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person would inform their doctor about the side effects of the prescribed pills during a scheduled appointment rather than missing the appointment altogether. By discussing the side effects with the doctor, they can work together to find an alternative medication or adjust the dosage to alleviate the symptoms."}}
{"Q": "Tim was struggling in math. Which event could cause Ultimately, he ended up failing the test and had to repeat the course?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Instead of asking for help, Tim went to a football game with his friends the night before the final exam. (B) Tim studied every night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Instead of asking for help, Tim went to a football game with his friends the night before the final exam.\n\nExplanation: This event could cause Tim to fail the test and have to repeat the course because he chose to prioritize socializing with his friends over studying and seeking help for his struggles in math. By not addressing his difficulties and not adequately preparing for the final exam, Tim put himself in a position to fail. On the other hand, option B suggests that Tim studied every night, which would likely improve his chances of passing the test and succeeding in the course."}}
{"Q": "The girls went to a bar. Which event could cause They went home talking about their night?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The girls enjoyed the bar. (B) They had a great time dancing until the morning.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The girls enjoyed the bar.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the girls went home talking about their night because they enjoyed the bar, rather than having a great time dancing until the morning. While dancing can be a fun activity, it is not necessarily the only reason why the girls would have had a memorable night. Enjoying the atmosphere, music, drinks, and company at the bar could have also contributed to their positive experience and led to them discussing it later."}}
{"Q": "Jo went up to the rooftop to work on her tan. Which event could cause The landlord heard her pounding and found Jo shivering on the roof?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She stayed out all day and when night came she went inside. (B) Jo accidentally got locked on top of the roof and started knocking on the door for help.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jo accidentally got locked on top of the roof and started knocking on the door for help.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it explains why Jo was pounding on the roof and why she was shivering when the landlord found her. If Jo had stayed out all day and went inside at night, she would not have been locked on the roof and would not have needed to knock on the door for help. Additionally, if she had been locked on the roof, it would explain why she was shivering as she may have been stuck there for a while."}}
{"Q": "Bob is surprised when his truck breaks down on the highway. Which event could cause The officer even gives Bob a ride to a car rental company?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) he thoought they would find it odd he was in middle of road. (B) A police officer stops in the park to help Bob.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a police officer would stop to help Bob on the highway and offer him a ride to a car rental company, rather than Bob thinking it would be odd for him to be in the middle of the road. It is common for police officers to assist stranded motorists on the highway."}}
{"Q": "I've always wanted to be able to bike thirty miles at one time. Which event could cause I am so out of shape I can't even bike a mile?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I have not been riding or working out though. (B) I have been riding and working out every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If someone has not been riding or working out, it is more plausible that they would be out of shape and unable to bike even a mile. Consistent exercise is necessary to build endurance and strength for longer rides."}}
{"Q": "Jacob woke up at a red light. Which event could cause Now Jacob only wakes up in his bed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) he fell asleep in the car. (B) Jacob vowed to never drive drunk again.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jacob fell asleep in the car and woke up at a red light rather than suddenly vowing to never drive drunk again and magically only waking up in his bed. Falling asleep in the car could be due to fatigue, medication, or other factors that can cause drowsiness while driving."}}
{"Q": "Bella was very pale. Which event could cause When she left, her skin was a summery golden brown?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she decided to take a much needed vacation in florida. (B) Bella decided to save the morning at the nail salon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She decided to take a much needed vacation in Florida.\nExplanation: Spending time in the sun can cause the skin to darken or tan. If Bella spent a significant amount of time in Florida, it is plausible that her skin would have turned golden brown. On the other hand, going to a nail salon would not have any significant impact on the color of her skin. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Cathy was happy that she finally had some time to sew. Which event could cause Cathy tapped her metal fingertips on the table in frustration?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cathy put the thimbles on. (B) Cathy could not get the thread into the fabric.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Cathy could not get the thread into the fabric.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Cathy would tap her metal fingertips on the table in frustration if she was having difficulty getting the thread into the fabric, rather than simply putting on thimbles. Putting on thimbles is a routine part of sewing and would not typically cause frustration. However, struggling to get the thread into the fabric can be a common and frustrating problem for sewers."}}
{"Q": "My grandmother made key lime pie. Which event could cause I went to the bathroom to spit it out?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I hated the pie. (B) I devoured the pie.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I hated the pie.\nExplanation: If someone hates the taste of a food, they may have a physical reaction such as gagging or feeling nauseous, which could cause them to go to the bathroom to spit it out. On the other hand, if someone devours a food, it means they eat it quickly and eagerly, which is unlikely to cause them to go to the bathroom to spit it out. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ned needed cigarettes - he was almost out. Which event could cause He bought himself two whole cartons of cigarettes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ned decided it was time to quit smoking and did so cold turkey. (B) Ned saw a great deal at the wholesale club.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ned saw a great deal at the wholesale club.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it directly relates to Ned's need for cigarettes and his decision to buy two whole cartons. It is common for smokers to stock up on cigarettes when they find a good deal, especially if they are almost out. Option (A) is less likely because it suggests that Ned quit smoking altogether, which would not lead to him buying two cartons of cigarettes."}}
{"Q": "My friends were taking me rock climbing. Which event could cause The next day, I went to the real rock wall and climbed it very well?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They wanted to start with a real rock wall for practice first. (B) We went to the gym to practice on a fake wall.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) We went to the gym to practice on a fake wall.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the friends took the narrator to a gym to practice on a fake wall before going to a real rock wall. This would allow the narrator to gain some experience and confidence before attempting a more challenging climb. Practicing on a fake wall would also allow the friends to provide guidance and instruction on proper climbing techniques and safety measures."}}
{"Q": "I went to the beach last summer to try to get a tan. Which event could cause I woke up with massive sunburn all over my body?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I fell asleep and didn't put more sunscreen on. (B) I fell asleep in the shade.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If the person fell asleep and didn't put more sunscreen on, they would have been exposed to the sun's harmful UV rays for an extended period of time without protection, leading to sunburn. Falling asleep in the shade would not cause massive sunburn all over the body as the shade would provide some protection from the sun's rays."}}
{"Q": "Kelly couldn't wait to go to Sephora for the first time to buy makeup. Which event could cause By the time she left the store, Kelly had about 12 different bags ful?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The saleslady knew Kelly was going to be an easy sale. (B) She couldn't believe how few choices she had.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The saleslady knew Kelly was going to be an easy sale.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the saleslady recognized Kelly's excitement and eagerness to buy makeup, and therefore suggested multiple products and encouraged her to try different items, resulting in Kelly purchasing more than she initially intended. It is unlikely that Kelly would leave the store with 12 bags full of makeup simply because she felt limited in her choices."}}
{"Q": "Television is a scary thing. Which event could cause I made a sandwich to satisfy my craving?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) One advertisement made me crave a sandwich. (B) I watched a show about scary things found around the world.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that an advertisement for a sandwich could make someone crave a sandwich, rather than watching a scary show causing someone to crave a sandwich. Advertisements are designed to make people want to buy or consume a product, and food advertisements in particular often use visuals and descriptions that can make viewers hungry. On the other hand, watching a scary show may cause someone to feel anxious or scared, which is unlikely to make them crave a sandwich."}}
{"Q": "One day Adam bought two BB guns. Which event could cause Adam was very proud of Christian?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Christian shot at Adam with the gun. (B) Adam gave one to Christian.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Adam gave one to Christian.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Adam would be proud of Christian for receiving a gift from him rather than being shot at with the gun. Giving a gift can be seen as a kind and generous act, which could make Adam feel proud of himself for being a good friend to Christian."}}
{"Q": "We attended a Halloween Which event could cause The host was scandalized?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The host boyfriend proposed to her in front of everyone. (B) The host had too much to drink and flirted with someone who was not his wife.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The host had too much to drink and flirted with someone who was not his wife.\nExplanation: This scenario is more likely to cause scandal as it involves inappropriate behavior and potential infidelity, which could lead to relationship problems and social repercussions. On the other hand, a marriage proposal is usually a happy and celebrated event, so it is unlikely to cause scandal unless there are underlying issues or conflicts involved."}}
{"Q": "Everyone in my family got together for Thanksgiving. Which event could cause We had a great time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People drove in from all over the state. (B) Everyone was angry and didn't eat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: People drove in from all over the state.\nExplanation: If everyone in the family got together for Thanksgiving, it is likely that people had to travel to be there. The fact that they made the effort to come from all over the state suggests that they were excited to spend time together and enjoy the holiday. Therefore, it is more plausible that this event would cause them to have a great time. On the other hand, if everyone was angry and didn't eat, it is unlikely that they would have had a good time."}}
{"Q": "Joe loved his beard. Which event could cause He decided to shave it and he got a job instantly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe was having a hard time picking a job. (B) Joe couldn't get hired because his beard looked unprofessional.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Joe couldn't get hired because his beard looked unprofessional.\nExplanation: Many workplaces have grooming standards that require employees to maintain a clean-shaven appearance or keep their facial hair neatly trimmed. If Joe was having difficulty finding a job, it's possible that his beard was seen as unprofessional or unkempt by potential employers. By deciding to shave his beard, Joe may have been able to present a more polished and professional appearance, which could have helped him land a job more quickly."}}
{"Q": "Ben decided to treat himself to a coffee. Which event could cause Ben was frustrated at the extra charge?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ben was charged extra for a cup. (B) The worker charged him double.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ben was charged extra for a cup.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ben would be frustrated at being charged extra for a cup, as this is a common practice in some coffee shops. On the other hand, it is less likely that the worker would charge him double without any reason, as this would be considered unethical and could result in negative consequences for the worker."}}
{"Q": "Joe had recently graduated from college. Which event could cause He had to get a part-time job delivering pizzas to support himself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe  have  money. (B) The job market was bad.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The job market was bad.\nExplanation: If the job market was bad, it would be difficult for Joe to find a full-time job in his field of study. As a result, he may have had to take a part-time job delivering pizzas to support himself financially until he could find a better job. Having money (choice A) would not be a reason for Joe to take a part-time job delivering pizzas."}}
{"Q": "Al loved sad music. Which event could cause As soon as he saw the tear he asked her to be his wife?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Al saw a woman at the grocery store crying when a sad song came on over the PA system. (B) Al's girlfriend cried during a sad song.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Al's girlfriend cried during a sad song.\nExplanation: Since Al loved sad music, it is more plausible that he would be moved by his girlfriend's emotional response to a sad song and ask her to be his wife. It is less likely that he would propose to a stranger at a grocery store just because they were crying during a sad song."}}
{"Q": "Lois hated math. Which event could cause She was wrong and quit within a month?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lois challenged herself by enrolling in a math class. (B) Lois thought tutoring would kill her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lois challenged herself by enrolling in a math class.\nExplanation: By enrolling in a math class, Lois is taking a proactive step towards overcoming her dislike for math. She may find that with the right teacher and approach, math is not as difficult or unpleasant as she thought. However, if she chooses to avoid math altogether and not challenge herself, she is more likely to give up quickly and not give herself a chance to succeed. Therefore, enrolling in a math class is a more plausible event that could cause Lois to realize she was wrong and continue with math."}}
{"Q": "I was walking home. Which event could cause The rain made me feel even more depressed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was a sunny day. (B) I was depressed because my girlfriend broke up with me. halfway through my walk it started to rain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I was depressed because my girlfriend broke up with me. halfway through my walk it started to rain.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the person was already feeling down due to the breakup, and the rain could have added to their negative emotions. Rainy weather is often associated with sadness and gloom, which could have intensified the person's feelings of depression. On the other hand, if it was a sunny day, it is less likely that the rain would have made the person feel more depressed."}}
{"Q": "Alex needed groceries. Which event could cause Alex bought a yacht?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She saw an advertisement for a car at the store. (B) She decided to go to a store and look at boats on her way grocery shopping.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She decided to go to a store and look at boats on her way grocery shopping.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alex would buy a yacht if she intentionally went to a store to look at boats, rather than randomly seeing an advertisement for a car at the grocery store and deciding to buy a yacht instead of groceries. The first scenario shows a deliberate decision to purchase a luxury item, while the second scenario seems unlikely and illogical."}}
{"Q": "I wanted a pet for my birthday. Which event could cause I drove home with the mini pig in my car?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My father gave me a bat instead. (B) I went to buy exotic pet with my father.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If the person went to buy an exotic pet with their father, it is plausible that they could have come across a mini pig and decided to bring it home as their birthday present. On the other hand, if the father gave them a bat instead, it is unlikely that the person would have gone out and bought a mini pig on their own and brought it home in their car."}}
{"Q": "The teacher told Diana that she's failing the class. Which event could cause She ended up with a 33 on the exam?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Diana decided to study with her friends instead of go out. (B) Diana decided she didn't care and didn't study for the exam.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Diana decided she didn't care and didn't study for the exam.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Diana's lack of effort and preparation for the exam resulted in her low score and ultimately failing the class. Choosing to study with friends instead of going out may have actually been a positive decision for her academic performance, but not studying at all would have a much greater impact on her grades."}}
{"Q": "There were two powerful families. Which event could cause The Lance's ended up winning the war and took over?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Funkel's won every battle, year after year. (B) the families had a fight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The Funkel's won every battle, year after year.\nExplanation: If one family consistently wins battles, it would weaken the other family's resources and morale, making it easier for the winning family to eventually take over. A single fight between the families may not necessarily result in one family winning the war and taking over."}}
{"Q": "Young Myron was used to being the center of his parents' lives. Which event could cause Myron realized there were good parts to being a big brother too?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Myron was not happy his parents were having a baby. (B) One day, Myron's parents said a new couch was on the way.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Myron was not happy his parents were having a baby.\nExplanation: If Myron was not happy about his parents having a baby, it could lead to him feeling left out or neglected. However, as he spends time with his new sibling and sees the love and attention his parents give to both of them, he may come to realize the benefits of being a big brother and the joy that comes with having a sibling. On the other hand, the arrival of a new couch (option B) is unlikely to have any impact on Myron's perception of being a big brother."}}
{"Q": "Amy awoke to see the sun was shining bright in the fall. Which event could cause Amy loved that beautiful fall day that felt like summer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy spent her day outside in the nice weather. (B) Amy stayed in the house all day long.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Amy spent her day outside in the nice weather.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Amy loved the beautiful fall day because she spent her day outside enjoying the nice weather. If she had stayed inside all day, she would not have been able to fully experience the beauty of the day. Additionally, the fact that the sun was shining bright suggests that it was a perfect day to be outside."}}
{"Q": "Terry was going through a big issue. Which event could cause He never would budge?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Terry and his wife wanted the same paint for their house. (B) Terry stood strong on his views.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Terry stood strong on his views.\nExplanation: If Terry is going through a big issue and he never would budge, it is more likely that he is standing strong on his views rather than just wanting the same paint as his wife for their house. Standing strong on one's views can be a deeply ingrained trait and can be difficult to change, especially during a challenging situation."}}
{"Q": "Quinton was getting evicted from his apartment. Which event could cause Quinton felt depressed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Quinton packed up his bags, and started looking for a new place. (B) Quinton could not find another apartment to move into.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Quinton could not find another apartment to move into.\nExplanation: This event could cause Quinton to feel depressed because he is facing the possibility of being homeless and not having a place to live. It can be stressful and overwhelming to search for a new apartment, especially if there are limited options available. This situation can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair, which are common symptoms of depression. Packing up his bags and starting to look for a new place may be a stressful event, but it is not as likely to cause depression as the possibility of not finding a new place to live."}}
{"Q": "Adam hired a maid to clean his house. Which event could cause The agency dismissed the thief at once?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The maid stole his silverware from the house. (B) That day Adam's house was robbed by the neighbor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: If the maid stole Adam's silverware, it would be a clear violation of trust and a breach of the agreement between Adam and the agency. Therefore, the agency would have a valid reason to dismiss the maid immediately. On the other hand, if Adam's house was robbed by the neighbor, it would not be the maid's fault, and the agency would not have any reason to dismiss her."}}
{"Q": "Dave's parents have a restaurant. Which event could cause They decided to close the business?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are getting more customers. (B) Dave's restaurant was no longer doing well.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Dave's restaurant was no longer doing well.\nExplanation: If Dave's restaurant was no longer doing well, it could lead to financial losses and make it difficult for his parents to sustain the business. This could eventually lead to them deciding to close the restaurant. On the other hand, if they were getting more customers, it would be a positive sign for the business and would not be a reason for them to close it."}}
{"Q": "Robbie struggled to hold his pencil correctly. Which event could cause Robbie, his teacher, and his mother were all thrilled when it worked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Robbie finally got it right. (B) They did not know how to help him hold the pencil easier.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Robbie finally got it right.\nExplanation: If Robbie finally got it right and was able to hold his pencil correctly, it would be a cause for celebration for his teacher and mother as it would mean that he can now write more easily and effectively. Option B is not a plausible answer as it suggests that they were unable to find a solution to Robbie's problem, which would not be a cause for celebration."}}
{"Q": "Jed was making a stew. Which event could cause Jed regretted he hadn't just had a bowl of cereal?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He ate some cereal in the meantime. (B) Jed burned the stew.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jed burned the stew.\nExplanation: If Jed burned the stew, it would be inedible and he would have to start over or find an alternative meal. This could cause him to regret not choosing a simpler and easier option like cereal. Eating some cereal in the meantime (option A) would not necessarily cause regret, as it could just be a snack or a way to hold him over until the stew is ready."}}
{"Q": "Annie accidentally slept in. Which event could cause Since she didn't have time, her hair ended up looking too messy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Annie had to jump up and rush to class before she was late. (B) She took her time brush her hair that night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Annie had to jump up and rush to class before she was late.\n\nExplanation: If Annie had to rush to class, she wouldn't have had time to properly brush and style her hair, resulting in a messy appearance. On the other hand, if she took her time brushing her hair the night before, it wouldn't necessarily affect how her hair looked the next morning when she overslept. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Nik was dating Jess. Which event could cause So Nick decided to propose to her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nik loved his girlfriend very much. (B) Nick and Jess had a horrible relationship.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Nik loved his girlfriend very much.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Nik decided to propose to Jess because he loved her very much and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. A strong and loving relationship is usually the foundation for a proposal, rather than a horrible relationship."}}
{"Q": "Jordan was wandering through the desert on his camel. Which event could cause Jordan realized he was lost, and drank his last drops of water?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) jordan didn't pack survival gear very well. (B) Jordan was getting hungry, but couldnt find water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: If Jordan was getting hungry but couldn't find water, it's likely that he would have been wandering for a while without success. This would increase the likelihood of him realizing he was lost and running out of water. On the other hand, if he didn't pack survival gear very well, he may have run out of water earlier and realized he was lost sooner. However, this scenario doesn't necessarily mean he would have drunk his last drops of water at that point."}}
{"Q": "Cora always wanted to take a cruise. Which event could cause Three weeks later Cora was finally enjoying the ocean breeze?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cora planned the cruise in the later years. (B) during vacation holiday cora travel on a boat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) during vacation holiday Cora traveled on a boat.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it directly relates to Cora's desire to take a cruise and explains how she was able to finally enjoy the ocean breeze. Option (A) suggests that Cora had planned the cruise for a long time, but it doesn't explain why she was able to go on the cruise three weeks later. Option (B) provides a clear cause-and-effect relationship between Cora's desire to take a cruise and her eventual ability to do so during a vacation holiday."}}
{"Q": "James went to the bistro to meet some friends. Which event could cause They finally left and everyone was relieved at James' bravery?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) James fought off a pack of dogs. (B) James never got in a fight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) James fought off a pack of dogs.\nExplanation: If James fought off a pack of dogs, it would be a brave and heroic act that would likely cause his friends to feel relieved and grateful for his safety. On the other hand, if James never got in a fight, there would be no reason for his friends to feel relieved at his bravery."}}
{"Q": "Derek has an interview for a job. Which event could cause He doesn't get the job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Derek did not prepare or dress nice. (B) Derek's interview went very well.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Derek did not prepare or dress nice.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Derek not preparing or dressing appropriately for the interview would cause him to not get the job. Employers often expect candidates to come prepared and present themselves professionally during the interview process. If Derek did not meet these expectations, it could negatively impact his chances of getting the job, regardless of how well the interview went."}}
{"Q": "Sam was swimming at the pool. Which event could cause Sam stayed out since he was already wet?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam got into the pool. (B) Sam got out and dried himself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sam got out and dried himself.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sam would get out of the pool and dry himself off if he wanted to stay out of the water, rather than getting back into the pool after already being wet. Getting out and drying off would also be a more common and practical solution if Sam needed to leave the pool area or go do something else."}}
{"Q": "My friends and I were playing outside. Which event could cause We put the gear away and went our separate ways?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We got into a fight. (B) Suddenly it started shining heavily.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Suddenly it started shining heavily.\nExplanation: If it started shining heavily, it could mean that a thunderstorm or heavy rain was approaching, which would make it necessary for the group to put away their gear and go their separate ways to seek shelter. On the other hand, if they got into a fight, it would be more likely that they would leave the area immediately rather than taking the time to put away their gear. Therefore, (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sandy's mom packed her a ham sandwich for lunch again. Which event could cause The were both happy with the trade?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Molly didn't like her tuna so she traded with Sandy. (B) Sandy's favorite sandwich was ham.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Molly traded her tuna sandwich with Sandy's ham sandwich, both Sandy and Molly would be happy with the trade. Sandy would get a different sandwich to eat, and Molly would get a sandwich she likes better. This scenario is more plausible than option B, where Sandy's favorite sandwich happens to be the one her mom packed for her."}}
{"Q": "I bought a backup drive for my wife's iPhone, using Amazon. Which event could cause I thanked Amazon for their great customer service?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) the iphone came fast. (B) Amazon asked me immediately to buy another item.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The prompt mentions that the individual bought a backup drive for their wife's iPhone, so the speed of delivery would be a significant factor in their satisfaction with Amazon's customer service. Option B, which suggests that Amazon immediately asked the individual to buy another item, is not related to the purchase of the backup drive and therefore would not be a plausible reason for thanking Amazon for their customer service."}}
{"Q": "Deena was walking home one cold day. Which event could cause The dog seemed sick so she took it home and kept it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Deena saw a little dog outside. (B) Deena saw a little turtle outside.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Deena saw a little dog outside.\nExplanation: Seeing a sick dog outside on a cold day would be a more plausible reason for Deena to take it home and care for it than seeing a turtle. Dogs are more commonly kept as pets and are more likely to be seen wandering outside, while turtles are less common and may not be in need of immediate care. Additionally, the fact that the dog seemed sick would likely have been a motivating factor for Deena to take it home and provide it with warmth and medical attention."}}
{"Q": "Tom and his wife Diane had just had their first child. Which event could cause He woke his wife to tell her, she then broke the news to him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Diane had the baby stay with their grandparents one night and didn't tell Tom. (B) They both decided together they wanted a divorce.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Diane had the baby stay with their grandparents one night and didn't tell Tom.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Diane had the baby stay with their grandparents one night and didn't tell Tom, as this is a common scenario where one parent may need a break or some help with the baby and may not want to disturb the other parent's sleep. On the other hand, it is unlikely that they would both decide together to get a divorce immediately after having their first child."}}
{"Q": "Kellen needed to find a better job. Which event could cause He is forever grateful to his friend for getting him the job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His friend Charlie had an opening at the bar. (B) Kellen's friend got him a lower paying sales job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His friend Charlie had an opening at the bar.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that Kellen's friend helped him secure a job that was better than his previous one. The fact that Kellen is forever grateful to his friend also implies that the job was a good fit for him and that he was able to improve his financial situation. On the other hand, option B suggests that Kellen's friend got him a lower paying job, which would not have been a reason for Kellen to be grateful."}}
{"Q": "Tom was listening to music in class. Which event could cause So Tom didn't know they weren't going to pick him up from school?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's cell phone rang, an he answered the call. (B) Tom didn't hear the message his teacher gave him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom didn't hear the message his teacher gave him.\nExplanation: If Tom was listening to music in class, it is likely that he had headphones on or the volume was turned up high, which could have prevented him from hearing the message his teacher gave him about not being picked up from school. On the other hand, if Tom's cell phone rang and he answered the call, it would not necessarily have affected his knowledge of whether or not he was going to be picked up from school."}}
{"Q": "Neil was a music lover. Which event could cause Neil thought Vienna was the most musical city on earth?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When Neil saved his money, he went to Austria. (B) Neil traveled to Vienna because of its great art.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. When Neil saved his money, he went to Austria.\nExplanation: If Neil saved his money to go to Austria, it suggests that he had a specific reason for choosing that destination. As a music lover, he may have been drawn to Vienna because of its rich musical history and reputation as a hub for classical music. On the other hand, traveling to Vienna for its art (as in option B) may not necessarily lead Neil to conclude that it is the most musical city on earth."}}
{"Q": "Ed was making whiskey at home. Which event could cause Sampling it, Ed decided his whiskey was great?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Whiskey was Ed's favorite drink. (B) Ed was nervous about how it would come out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Ed was nervous about how it would come out.\nExplanation: If Ed was nervous about how his whiskey would turn out, it suggests that he was unsure of the quality of his product. Sampling it and deciding that it was great would then be a positive outcome and a reason for him to feel proud and satisfied with his creation. On the other hand, Ed's preference for whiskey (choice A) does not necessarily indicate that he would automatically think his homemade whiskey was great, as taste and quality can vary greatly between different types and brands of whiskey."}}
{"Q": "Susan noticed that her feet were really swollen. Which event could cause After a few days she noticed that the swelling in her feet had gone d?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Susan was six months pregnant. (B) She talked to her doctor and gave them some advice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Susan was six months pregnant.\nExplanation: Swelling in the feet is a common symptom during pregnancy due to the increased pressure on the veins in the lower body. This pressure can cause fluid to accumulate in the feet and ankles, leading to swelling. As Susan was six months pregnant, it is likely that her swollen feet were caused by her pregnancy. After a few days, the swelling may have gone down due to changes in her body or rest. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any specific reason for the swelling to go down."}}
{"Q": "Beth had been getting a lot of sore throats. Which event could cause She enjoyed the relaxation and ice cream in the meantime?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She ended up having surgery to remove her leg. (B) Beth eventually had her tonsils out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Beth eventually had her tonsils out.\nExplanation: Sore throats are a common symptom of tonsillitis, which is an inflammation of the tonsils. If Beth had been experiencing frequent sore throats, it is possible that she had chronic tonsillitis, which may require surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy) as a treatment option. On the other hand, having surgery to remove her leg is not related to her sore throat symptoms and seems like an unlikely event to occur in this scenario. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Charlie was driving to his friend's house in his new car. Which event could cause He declined and followed street laws like a responsible car owner?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Another driver challenged him to drag race. (B) Charlies friend wanted him to slow down and get there later.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Charlies friend wanted him to slow down and get there later.\nExplanation: Charlie is a responsible car owner and following street laws is important for his safety and the safety of others on the road. It is unlikely that he would accept a challenge to drag race as it is illegal and dangerous. On the other hand, it is plausible that his friend may have asked him to slow down and arrive later, perhaps due to traffic or other concerns."}}
{"Q": "Cornelia had always loved working with her hands. Which event could cause Cornelia chopped the table up for firewood?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cornelia needed firewood for her fireplace. (B) Cornelia needed firewood but had run out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Cornelia needed firewood but had run out.\nExplanation: Since Cornelia loved working with her hands, it is unlikely that she would chop up a table for firewood unless she had no other option. Option B suggests that she had run out of firewood, which would be a more plausible reason for her to resort to using furniture as fuel. Option A suggests that she already had firewood and therefore would not need to chop up a table."}}
{"Q": "A man made a wishing well next to his mailbox. Which event could cause He paid for the entire meal in change?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The change filled up with wishing wells. (B) Every person who walked by tossed in a coin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Every person who walked by tossed in a coin.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that people walking by the mailbox and seeing the wishing well would toss in a coin, rather than the change from paying for a meal filling up the wishing well."}}
{"Q": "Sam was excited, the day was finally here. Which event could cause Sam decided that a wedding pie would have to suffice?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam almost dropped the wedding cake. (B) Sam got news that his wedding cake got ruined.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sam got news that his wedding cake got ruined.\nExplanation: If Sam received news that his wedding cake got ruined, it would be a plausible reason for him to decide that a wedding pie would have to suffice. This would be a disappointing and stressful situation, and Sam may not have had enough time or resources to get a new cake. Choosing a wedding pie as a replacement could be a practical and tasty solution. On the other hand, almost dropping the wedding cake may cause Sam to be more careful with it, but it would not necessarily lead to him choosing a wedding pie instead."}}
{"Q": "Joe ordered a dining room set off of the internet for his wife. Which event could cause Joe had ordered doll furniture by mistake?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe did not read the website correctly. (B) When Joe unpacked the furniture he realized it was too fancy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Joe did not read the website correctly.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe made a mistake while ordering the furniture online and did not read the website correctly, leading him to accidentally order doll furniture instead of a dining room set. It is less likely that he would mistake doll furniture for a dining room set when unpacking it, as the two are typically very different in size and appearance."}}
{"Q": "Jacob was driving home from work. Which event could cause He felt really good knowing his help was so appreciated?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He stopped to help someone deflating a flat tire. (B) Jacob stopped to help someone fix a tire.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: If Jacob stopped to help someone with a flat tire and was able to successfully assist them, it is likely that the person would express gratitude and appreciation for his help. This positive feedback could make Jacob feel good about himself and his actions, leading to a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Additionally, helping others can often boost one's mood and overall sense of well-being, so it is plausible that Jacob would feel good after providing assistance to someone in need."}}
{"Q": "Ann was my date to our elementary school graduation party. Which event could cause Suddenly she leaped across the car seat and planted a kiss on my lips?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She is not my favorite since childhood. (B) I drove Ann home from the party.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I drove Ann home from the party.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the sudden kiss happened during the car ride home, as they were alone and had the opportunity for a private moment. Choice (A) does not provide any context or reason for the sudden kiss."}}
{"Q": "Robbie just joined a new band. Which event could cause They record a record together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They ruin a lot of songs. (B) Robbie has a bandmate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Robbie has a bandmate.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that recording a record together would be a result of Robbie having a bandmate, as recording typically requires multiple musicians. Ruining a lot of songs would not necessarily lead to recording a record, as it would indicate a lack of success in creating music rather than a successful collaboration."}}
{"Q": "Tom wanted to take Shelly on a date. Which event could cause They both just sat and watched the sunset together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom and Shelly went up to the beach. (B) Tom took her to a hilltop picnic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom took her to a hilltop picnic.\nExplanation: A hilltop picnic is a romantic and intimate setting that would be perfect for watching the sunset together. It provides a beautiful view and a peaceful atmosphere, which would allow Tom and Shelly to enjoy each other's company without any distractions. On the other hand, going up to the beach may involve more activities and people around, making it less likely for them to just sit and watch the sunset together."}}
{"Q": "Dave loved the outdoors. Which event could cause Dave took pictures of the tall trees?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather was beautiful. (B) The weather was raining hard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The weather was beautiful.\nExplanation: Since Dave loved the outdoors, it is more plausible that he would take pictures of the tall trees on a beautiful day when he could fully appreciate their beauty and majesty. On a rainy day, the trees may not look as impressive and it may be more difficult to take clear pictures."}}
{"Q": "Cindy came down sick. Which event could cause Cindy started taking it that nigh?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her mother bought her some cough medicine. (B) Her mother bought her some candy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her mother bought her some cough medicine.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Cindy's sickness prompted her mother to buy her cough medicine, rather than candy, which would not have any medicinal properties to help her feel better. Cough medicine is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of sickness, such as coughing, which suggests that Cindy's illness was the cause of her taking the medicine."}}
{"Q": "Jeremy had a huge test at school. Which event could cause Suddenly, his teacher woke him up and made him finish the test?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jeremy fell asleep at his desk at home while studying. (B) Jeremy was so tired he fell asleep during the test!.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jeremy was so tired he fell asleep during the test!\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it directly relates to the situation of Jeremy having a test at school. It is common for students to feel tired during exams, especially if they have been studying for a long time. Falling asleep during the test would be a more realistic scenario than falling asleep while studying at home. Additionally, the teacher waking him up to finish the test shows that he was already in the classroom and not at home."}}
{"Q": "Tara wanted to repaint her room. Which event could cause She went home and painted her room pink by herself?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tara wanted a more comfortable room. (B) Tara bought the blue paint that she saw at the store.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Tara wanted a more comfortable room.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Tara's desire to repaint her room. If Tara wanted a more comfortable room, she may have decided that a new color would help achieve that goal. On the other hand, buying blue paint at the store does not necessarily mean that Tara would paint her room pink, as the two events are not directly related."}}
{"Q": "Allie didn't own many purses, but was attached to the few she had. Which event could cause She missed her old purse, but began to love the new one just as much?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her mom gave her a new one for her birthday and she sold it. (B) Unfortunately she lost one of hers and bought a new one.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Unfortunately she lost one of hers and bought a new one.\nExplanation: Losing a beloved possession can be a traumatic experience, but replacing it with a new one can help ease the pain. Allie's attachment to her old purses suggests that she values them highly, so it's likely that losing one would cause her to feel a sense of loss. However, buying a new purse that she loves just as much would help her move on and feel attached to the new one. On the other hand, selling a gift from her mom would be unlikely to result in the same level of attachment to the new purse."}}
{"Q": "A man called me late in the afternoon on my house phone. Which event could cause A few seconds later he called back?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I picked up the phone but the man didn't speak english. (B) He breathed hard into the phone and spoke a vulgar word.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the man didn't speak English, it's possible that he hung up and called back hoping to reach someone who could understand him. If he spoke a vulgar word, it's less likely that he would call back immediately unless he had a specific reason to do so. Therefore, option A is a more plausible reason for the man to call back a few seconds later."}}
{"Q": "Tom was drunk at a party. Which event could cause It made him finally admit to being drunk?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is honest when he is drunk. (B) Tom ended up going to a cafe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom is honest when he is drunk.\nExplanation: It is a common stereotype that people tend to be more honest when they are under the influence of alcohol. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom admitted to being drunk because he was being honest due to his intoxicated state. On the other hand, going to a cafe does not necessarily have any correlation with admitting to being drunk."}}
{"Q": "Beth was riding her bike at the park near her house. Which event could cause The mother and her babies looked up then continued on their way?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Beth saw a mother yelling at her babies in a stroller. (B) Beth saw a mother duck and her babies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Beth saw a mother duck and her babies.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the mother and her babies looked up and continued on their way after seeing a mother duck and her babies, as this is a common sight in parks. It is unlikely that they would react in this way to a mother yelling at her babies in a stroller, as this is not a typical occurrence in a park setting."}}
{"Q": "Tony liked art. Which event could cause Tony was hired immediately and succeeded?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tony's artwork was considered a masterpiece by the museum. (B) Tony was turned down for a position at a gallery.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tony's artwork was considered a masterpiece by the museum.\nExplanation: If Tony's artwork was considered a masterpiece by the museum, it would demonstrate his exceptional talent and skill in the field of art. This would make him a highly desirable candidate for any art-related job, and it is likely that he would be hired immediately and succeed in his new position. On the other hand, being turned down for a position at a gallery would not necessarily lead to immediate success, as it does not demonstrate Tony's abilities or potential for success in the art world."}}
{"Q": "I made a warm scarf for my mom. Which event could cause Now I make scarves for everyone else, too?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mom didn't like it. (B) Everyone admired my moms scarf.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Everyone admired my mom's scarf.\nExplanation: If everyone admired the scarf that was made for the mom, it is likely that the person who made the scarf received positive feedback and encouragement to make more scarves. This could have led to the person making scarves for everyone else as well. On the other hand, if the mom didn't like the scarf, it is less likely that the person would continue making scarves for others."}}
{"Q": "Ava wanted to go to the zoo. Which event could cause They had a great day at the zoo?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ava saw all of the animals. (B) Ava's parents had never been to the zoo.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Ava saw all of the animals.\nExplanation: If Ava saw all of the animals she wanted to see, it is likely that she had a great day at the zoo. Seeing all of the animals would have been a fulfilling experience for her, and she would have felt satisfied with her visit. On the other hand, Ava's parents never having been to the zoo may have been exciting for them, but it does not necessarily guarantee that Ava had a great day at the zoo."}}
{"Q": "Ryan climbed the long set of stairs to get to the water slide. Which event could cause It was even more fun than he expected?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ryan was scared to go down the water slide. (B) Ryan loved going down the water slide.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Since Ryan climbed the long set of stairs to get to the water slide, it can be assumed that he was excited to go down it. Therefore, it is more plausible that he loved going down the water slide and found it even more fun than he expected. Option A, where Ryan was scared to go down the water slide, would not lead to the conclusion that it was more fun than he expected."}}
{"Q": "Bob was out hunting for deer. Which event could cause Bob was rescued and was more careful from then on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Stu wasn't paying attention and fell into a ravine breaking his leg. (B) Bob fell into a pit and was stuck there for hours.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If Bob fell into a pit and was stuck there for hours, it would be a traumatic experience that could cause him to be more careful in the future. He may have realized the dangers of hunting alone and not being aware of his surroundings. On the other hand, Stu breaking his leg may not have directly affected Bob's hunting habits and may not have been as impactful."}}
{"Q": "I never met my real mom. Which event could cause Or if I should continue my mission until she really is a ghost?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I have looked for her. (B) I found my mother, and wondered if I should give her up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) I have looked for her.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the event causing the question is the fact that the person has been searching for their real mother but has not been successful in finding her. This could lead to the question of whether to continue the search or give up. On the other hand, finding the mother and considering giving her up seems less likely as it is unclear why someone would search for their mother only to consider giving her up once found."}}
{"Q": "Ivan had one cat. Which event could cause Both cats were very happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ivan’s cat ran away. (B) Ivan adopted a second cat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Ivan adopted a second cat.\nExplanation: If Ivan adopted a second cat, then both cats would have a companion to play with and keep them company. This would likely make both cats very happy. On the other hand, if Ivan's cat ran away, the remaining cat may feel lonely and sad, which would not result in both cats being happy. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A home was robbed in the neighborhood. Which event could cause Charles had posted a picture on Instagram of him with his brother?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Charles was the police. (B) Charles was home when it happened and went to the scene.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Charles was home when it happened and went to the scene.\nExplanation: If Charles was home when the robbery happened and went to the scene, it is possible that he could have seen something or have information that could be helpful to the police investigation. However, if Charles was the police (option A), it is unlikely that his Instagram post would have any direct impact on the investigation."}}
{"Q": "Jim decided to be a rockstar. Which event could cause Jim signed up for guitar lessons?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) but didn't know how to play an instrument. (B) Jim knew he would need to have a nickname.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Jim decided to be a rockstar but didn't know how to play an instrument, it would be logical for him to sign up for guitar lessons in order to learn how to play and achieve his goal of becoming a rockstar. On the other hand, the fact that Jim knew he would need a nickname does not necessarily have any direct correlation with him signing up for guitar lessons."}}
{"Q": "Steve wanted to start a new business. Which event could cause Steve got paid $500 for the two snakes he caught?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Steve was unafraid of snakes people found in homes. (B) He caught some snakes to buy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He caught some snakes to buy.\nExplanation: If Steve caught some snakes to buy, it suggests that he was already in the business of buying and selling snakes. Therefore, it is more plausible that he got paid $500 for the two snakes he caught as part of his business rather than simply catching snakes found in homes."}}
{"Q": "We lived in a condo from 1987 to 2013. Which event could cause My daughter was better the next day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One day my daughter got a bad grade and had to stay home from school. (B) My daughter always suffered from tiredness and allergies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Option A suggests that the daughter stayed home from school due to a bad grade, which could have been a temporary stressor. It is possible that the rest and relaxation at home helped her feel better the next day. Option B, on the other hand, suggests a chronic condition of tiredness and allergies, which would not likely be resolved overnight. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Bob discovered his truck had a flat tire. Which event could cause Bob drove his truck to the market?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob had no spare tire. (B) He changed the flat himself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He changed the flat himself.\n\nExplanation: If Bob changed the flat tire himself, he would still be able to drive his truck to the market. However, if he had no spare tire, he would not be able to drive his truck with a flat tire and would have to find another means of transportation. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Al was the scrawniest guy in his gym class, and was always teased. Which event could cause In September his classmates didn't recognize him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Al joined a gym over the summer. (B) Over the summer Al got into an accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Al joined a gym over the summer.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Al worked hard to improve his physical appearance and fitness by joining a gym over the summer, rather than getting into an accident that drastically changed his appearance. Joining a gym and working out regularly can lead to significant changes in one's body shape and size, which could explain why his classmates didn't recognize him in September."}}
{"Q": "Anthony wanted to learn how to speak Spanish. Which event could cause Anthony became successful because of his linguistic abilities?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anthony took a spanish class and excelled. (B) Anthony instead learned Klingon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Anthony took a Spanish class and excelled.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anthony would become successful in Spanish if he actually learned the language. Taking a Spanish class would provide him with the necessary skills and knowledge to communicate effectively in Spanish. Learning Klingon, on the other hand, is not a widely spoken language and would not likely lead to success in the same way that learning Spanish would."}}
{"Q": "Chang was finishing up lunch when all of a sudden he heard a noise. Which event could cause The volcano stopped being active before the lava could damage the cit?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chang looked out his window to see what was happening. (B) Chang looked outside and saw the volcano was still.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Chang looked outside and saw the volcano was still.\nExplanation: Since the question mentions that the volcano stopped being active before the lava could damage the city, it is more plausible that Chang would look outside and see that the volcano was still, rather than looking out the window to see what was happening. The latter option does not provide any information about the state of the volcano."}}
{"Q": "Alice wanted to learn how to kick a corner kick for her team. Which event could cause Alice kicked the corner in the game that led to the winning header?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice asked her coach to kiss her. (B) Alice practiced the corner kick for hours every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Alice practicing the corner kick for hours every day is a more plausible answer as it shows that Alice put in the effort and dedication to improve her skills. This would increase the likelihood of her successfully executing the corner kick in the game, leading to the winning header. Asking her coach to kiss her is not relevant or related to learning how to kick a corner kick and would not have any impact on her performance in the game."}}
{"Q": "Anna was sewing a dress. Which event could cause She had to take a break to bandage her wound?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna poked her needle with the finger. (B) Anna got stuck with a needle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Anna poked her needle with the finger.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Anna accidentally poked her finger with the needle while sewing, which could cause a wound that requires bandaging. Getting stuck with a needle is less likely to cause a significant injury that would require a break to bandage."}}
{"Q": "Jay went to put his pants to get ready for work. Which event could cause Jay tossed aside the belt and said that he'd buy a new one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jay realized his belt buckle was broken. (B) Jay carefully fastened his belt.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jay realized his belt buckle was broken.\nExplanation: If Jay realized that his belt buckle was broken, he would not be able to fasten his belt properly, which could cause him to toss it aside and decide to buy a new one. On the other hand, if he carefully fastened his belt, there would be no reason for him to throw it away and buy a new one. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "As the friends boarded flight to Australia, they felt strange. Which event could cause They were being followed and neither recognized it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They both were aware that they were being followed. (B) The two friends sat in the plan.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The two friends sat in the plane.\nExplanation: If the friends were aware that they were being followed, they would not feel strange but rather anxious or scared. Therefore, option (A) is not a plausible answer. On the other hand, option (B) is more likely as the friends could have been followed without realizing it, which could make them feel uneasy or strange."}}
{"Q": "Anna was at an Easter party. Which event could cause Anna won the Easter Egg Hunt?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anna tried her best to find all the eggs. (B) Anna ran around but didn't find any eggs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Anna tried her best to find all the eggs.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anna won the Easter Egg Hunt because she tried her best to find all the eggs. The Easter Egg Hunt is a competition where the person who finds the most eggs or completes the task in the shortest amount of time wins. If Anna tried her best, she would have had a better chance of finding more eggs than someone who didn't put in as much effort. Running around without finding any eggs would not lead to winning the competition."}}
{"Q": "Ian was playing an online game. Which event could cause But he didn't feel any better?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ian took off from school for being sick and played all day. (B) One of Mike's friends was defending him from some players who were talking trash.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ian didn't feel any better because of the negative comments and trash talk from other players in the game, rather than him playing all day while being sick. The social interaction and bullying in the game could have caused Ian to feel worse emotionally, leading to him not feeling any better."}}
{"Q": "Anna was going on a river cruise. Which event could cause She had a wonderful time on her cruise?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anna went on her cruise fully prepared for any activity. (B) Anna went with her former best friend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Anna went on her cruise fully prepared for any activity.\nExplanation: If Anna was fully prepared for any activity, she would have been able to participate in all the activities offered on the cruise without any hindrance. This would have allowed her to fully enjoy her experience and have a wonderful time. Being prepared would have also ensured that she had all the necessary items and equipment needed for the activities, making her experience more comfortable and enjoyable. Therefore, this event is more plausible to cause Anna to have a wonderful time on her cruise."}}
{"Q": "Bee was digging in his backyard. Which event could cause He did, however, find three dimes and a bottle cap?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He did not find any relics for his history class. (B) Bee found a treasure he was looking for,.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He did not find any relics for his history class.\nExplanation: The fact that Bee found three dimes and a bottle cap does not necessarily mean that he found a treasure he was looking for. It is more plausible that he was digging in his backyard to find relics for his history class, but unfortunately did not find any. The discovery of the dimes and bottle cap could simply be a coincidence or a small consolation prize."}}
{"Q": "I was trying to eat lunch at home yesterday when a fly flew in. Which event could cause Eventually I killed it with a newspaper?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It buzzed around then flew out the window. (B) it was landing everywhere.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) it was landing everywhere.\nExplanation: If the fly was landing everywhere, it would have been more difficult to shoo it out of the house, and it may have been more annoying to the person trying to eat lunch. This could have led to the person becoming frustrated and eventually resorting to killing the fly with a newspaper. If the fly had simply buzzed around and flown out the window, there would have been no need to kill it."}}
{"Q": "Jackson was at the lake with his family. Which event could cause He reeled the fish in and proudly showed it off?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So his family decided they would take the boat out and go fishing. (B) Jackson was swimming in the lake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Jackson's family decided to go fishing and took the boat out, it is likely that Jackson also participated in the fishing activity and caught a fish that he reeled in and showed off to his family. On the other hand, if Jackson was swimming in the lake, it is less likely that he would suddenly catch a fish and show it off. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Alice was getting married in a few weeks. Which event could cause Alice called her mother and apologized profusely?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Alice skipped the wedding. (B) Alice forgot to invite her mother to the weeks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Alice forgot to invite her mother to the wedding.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alice would apologize for forgetting to invite her mother to the wedding, as this is a common mistake that can cause hurt feelings. Skipping the wedding would be a much more serious offense and would likely require more than a simple apology."}}
{"Q": "Herb loved meditation. Which event could cause Herb had relapsed and fell ill?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Herb was stressed and decided he needed to meditate. (B) Herb wanted to drink.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Herb wanted to drink.\nExplanation: If Herb relapsed and fell ill, it is more likely that he had succumbed to his addiction and started drinking again, rather than being stressed and needing to meditate. Relapse is a common occurrence in addiction recovery, and the temptation to drink or use drugs can be overwhelming. Therefore, it is more plausible that Herb's relapse was triggered by his desire to drink, rather than his need to meditate."}}
{"Q": "Nancy caught Chris copying the answers for tomorrow's exam. Which event could cause Nancy couldn't hold the secret and confessed it to everyone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nancy didn't tell anyone about what Chris did. (B) Chris pleaded with Nancy not to tell anyone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Nancy couldn't hold the secret and confessed it to everyone because Chris pleaded with her not to tell anyone. This suggests that Chris's actions were particularly egregious and that he may have even tried to manipulate or guilt Nancy into keeping quiet. Additionally, the fact that Chris was caught cheating suggests that he may have a history of dishonesty, which could have made Nancy feel even more compelled to speak up."}}
{"Q": "Gina was in the middle of the backseat surrounded by siblings. Which event could cause Gina continued to stare?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gina could see a strange dog in the car next to them. (B) Gina could not see anything out of the car,.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Since Gina was in the middle of the backseat surrounded by siblings, it is unlikely that she would be able to see anything outside of the car, especially if she was shorter than her siblings. Therefore, it is more plausible that she continued to stare because she could not see anything out of the car."}}
{"Q": "Caroline decided to take a surfing class at the beach. Which event could cause Now she likes to build sandcastles when she goes to the beach?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She fell and flopped and almost drowned. (B) Caroline then made a surfboard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Caroline then made a surfboard.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Caroline's positive experience of taking a surfing class and learning how to ride the waves inspired her to continue exploring beach activities. Making a surfboard would also require spending more time at the beach and being interested in the surfing culture, which could lead to her enjoying building sandcastles as well. On the other hand, falling and almost drowning would likely discourage Caroline from wanting to return to the beach or engage in any beach-related activities."}}
{"Q": "Amy wanted to learn how to draw. Which event could cause Her face lit up when she saw her drawings were on the fridge?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy didn't practice drawing all day. (B) Amy practiced and gave the drawing to her mom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Amy practiced and gave the drawing to her mom.\nExplanation: If Amy practiced drawing and gave her drawing to her mom, it is likely that her mom appreciated her effort and displayed the drawing on the fridge. This positive feedback would make Amy happy and encourage her to continue practicing and improving her drawing skills. Therefore, it is more plausible that this event caused her face to light up."}}
{"Q": "Bob wanted to go to Paris. Which event could cause Bob accepted the refund and never went to Paris?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He booked a trip, but the tour company cancelled it. (B) Events caused Bob to speed up his trip.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the tour company cancelled Bob's trip, he may have accepted the refund and decided not to go to Paris. However, if events caused Bob to speed up his trip, it is unlikely that he would have accepted a refund and cancelled his trip altogether. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sara needed a prescription. Which event could cause He had her prescription ready and handed it over?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sara walked up to the pharmacy to see if her prescription was ready. (B) Sara went to the library to talk to the pharmacist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If Sara walked up to the pharmacy to see if her prescription was ready, it is more likely that the pharmacist had her prescription ready and handed it over to her. Going to the library to talk to the pharmacist is not a typical scenario for getting a prescription filled, so it is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Nina wanted a nice Halloween costume. Which event could cause Nina bought a toy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nina was a chameleon. (B) She couldn't find one that interested her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She couldn't find one that interested her.\nExplanation: If Nina couldn't find a Halloween costume that interested her, she may have decided to buy a toy instead. This is a more plausible answer than (A) Nina being a chameleon, as it is unclear how being a chameleon would lead to buying a toy for a Halloween costume."}}
{"Q": "It snowed in Kelly's neighborhood about three feet. Which event could cause Kelly was happy to make the extra money?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly decided to shovel her snow into her neighbor's yard. (B) Kelly shoveled her neighbor's drive way.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Kelly shoveled her neighbor's driveway.\n\nExplanation: Shoveling her neighbor's driveway would be a more plausible reason for Kelly to be happy to make extra money after a snowstorm. Shoveling snow into her neighbor's yard would be considered rude and could potentially cause conflict with her neighbors. Shoveling her neighbor's driveway, on the other hand, would be a helpful and neighborly gesture, and could earn her some extra cash."}}
{"Q": "Joe was walking through downtown. Which event could cause He reluctantly agreed to give them an interview?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was approached by a pretty woman. (B) He was approached by a survey taker.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He was approached by a survey taker.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe would reluctantly agree to give an interview to a survey taker who is conducting research or collecting data, rather than a pretty woman who may not have any professional reason to interview him."}}
{"Q": "Sam let Tim borrow his headphones. Which event could cause Sam was just happy Tim told the truth?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim kept Sam's headphones safe. (B) Tim lost the headphones and told Sam.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tim lost the headphones and told Sam.\nExplanation: If Tim lost the headphones and told Sam the truth, it shows that Tim is honest and trustworthy. Sam would be happy that Tim was honest with him and would appreciate the fact that Tim took responsibility for his actions. On the other hand, if Tim kept the headphones safe, it is expected behavior and does not necessarily warrant Sam's happiness."}}
{"Q": "Beth and her friends were studying together. Which event could cause Everyone laughed at the funny video?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They took a study break to film videos. (B) Beth found a funny cat video.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Beth found a funny cat video.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Beth found a funny cat video while they were studying and shared it with her friends, causing everyone to laugh. Taking a study break to film videos may not necessarily result in everyone laughing at a funny video."}}
{"Q": "I just completed my first marathon today. Which event could cause I've never been happier?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Running a marathon is a goal I worked towards for a long time. (B) I trained really hard and was almost the last one to the finish line.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Running a marathon is a goal I worked towards for a long time.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the feeling of happiness comes from achieving a long-term goal that required hard work and dedication. The fact that the person completed their first marathon indicates that they had been preparing for it for a while, and the sense of accomplishment from achieving a significant personal milestone can be a source of great happiness. On the other hand, finishing last in a race may not necessarily bring about feelings of happiness, as it may be perceived as a failure or disappointment."}}
{"Q": "Sasha had a crush on a boy in her class. Which event could cause The two went on a date to the movies?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The boy asked Sasha out. (B) Sasha was afraid ask him out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The boy asked Sasha out.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy would ask Sasha out on a date, as it is a common social norm for the person who is interested to initiate the invitation. It is less likely that Sasha would be afraid to ask him out, as this would require assuming her feelings were reciprocated and taking a risk."}}
{"Q": "My friends and I were playing outside. Which event could cause We enthusiastically played the game till it got dark?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My friends and I were enjoying a timeout. (B) We were having so much fun together.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) We were having so much fun together.\nExplanation: If the group of friends were having fun together, it is likely that they would continue playing the game enthusiastically until it got dark. Enjoying a timeout could mean that they were taking a break from playing and may not necessarily lead to playing until it got dark."}}
{"Q": "Tim got in a fight at school. Which event could cause Tim was ashamed and wished he hadn't reacted that way?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim had punched a woman who insulted him. (B) Tim couldn't handle a joke.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tim couldn't handle a joke.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tim got in a fight because he couldn't handle a joke rather than punching a woman who insulted him. Punching a woman would be considered a more serious offense and would likely result in legal consequences, whereas getting into a fight over a joke is a more common occurrence among teenagers. Additionally, if Tim punched a woman who insulted him, he may not feel ashamed and may justify his actions as self-defense. However, if he got in a fight over a joke, he may feel embarrassed and regretful for overreacting to something that was meant to be harmless."}}
{"Q": "The high school hired a new football coach. Which event could cause The new coach was soon fired?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The new football coach's wife called his player names. (B) The coach lost every game.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The coach lost every game.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the coach would be fired if he consistently lost every game, as winning is a crucial aspect of a football coach's job. On the other hand, while the coach's wife calling his players names could be a problem, it is less likely to result in immediate termination unless it was a severe and ongoing issue."}}
{"Q": "I'll bring the lemonade and Jane can bring the cake. Which event could cause Yes, and I bought it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I made the lemonade. (B) Jane asked me if I found the cake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I made the lemonade.\nExplanation: If the speaker says \"I'll bring the lemonade\" and then later says \"Yes, and I bought it,\" it implies that they went ahead and made the lemonade themselves instead of buying it. This suggests that they found a recipe, bought the necessary ingredients, and made the lemonade from scratch. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B doesn't make sense in this context because it doesn't explain why the speaker would say \"Yes, and I bought it.\""}}
{"Q": "There once was a man named mcphee. Which event could cause So he taught them some tricks?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) McPhee then became a teacher  for kids. (B) he was a guy who loved magic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. McPhee then became a teacher for kids.\nExplanation: The fact that McPhee taught tricks to others suggests that he had some knowledge or expertise in the subject. It is more plausible that he became a teacher for kids to share his skills rather than simply being a guy who loved magic."}}
{"Q": "I finished my a day at my first job. Which event could cause I went home and hung out with my friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had the rest of the day off. (B) I called my friends to tell them how it went.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I had the rest of the day off.\nExplanation: If the person finished their first job and had the rest of the day off, it would be more plausible for them to go home and hang out with their friends. On the other hand, if they called their friends to tell them how it went, it doesn't necessarily mean they would go hang out with them right away. They could still have work or other obligations to attend to."}}
{"Q": "Christian's grandma wanted to surprise him with a gift. Which event could cause Christian went outside to see a brand new shiny bike?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) So, she bought him a brand new scooter and told him to come outside. (B) She decided to surprise him one day when he was over.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. So, she bought him a brand new scooter and told him to come outside.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the prompt mentions a \"brand new shiny bike,\" which implies that it is a vehicle of some sort. Option A mentions a brand new scooter, which is a similar type of vehicle to a bike. Option B does not mention any specific reason for Christian to go outside, so it is less likely that he would see a bike waiting for him. Additionally, the prompt mentions that Christian's grandma wanted to surprise him, and telling him to come outside to see a new gift is a common way to do so."}}
{"Q": "Braden bought a bike for his son. Which event could cause Braden laughed and congratulated his wife and son on a job well done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Braden worked late, and his wife put the bike together. (B) Braden's wife taught his dog to ride it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Braden worked late, and his wife put the bike together.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Braden would laugh and congratulate his wife and son on a job well done if his wife successfully put the bike together while he was working late. This shows that his wife is capable and resourceful, and that they were able to surprise their son with a new bike. It is unlikely that Braden would laugh and congratulate his wife and son if his wife taught their dog to ride the bike, as this is not a realistic scenario."}}
{"Q": "Lauren could not remember where she left her coat. Which event could cause Her jacket was there and Lauren was ecstatic?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She found it very quickly. (B) She checked everywhere, her room, the car, the kitchen, eventually she checked her friends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She found it very quickly.\nExplanation: If Lauren found her coat very quickly, she would be ecstatic because she wouldn't have to spend a lot of time searching for it. It's a simple and straightforward solution to her problem. On the other hand, option B involves a lot of effort and time spent searching for the coat, which might not necessarily make Lauren feel ecstatic. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ted was excited about trying out his new lawnmower. Which event could cause Ted thought his decision to spend thousands on the lawnmower was good?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He couldn't believe how effiiently and quickly the lawn mower did the job. (B) His new one didn't work well.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Ted found that his new lawnmower efficiently and quickly did the job, he would feel that his decision to spend thousands on it was good. This would confirm that he made a wise investment and that the lawnmower was worth the money he spent on it. On the other hand, if his new lawnmower didn't work well, he would feel disappointed and regretful about his decision to spend so much money on it. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gary went on vacation to the Grand Canyon. Which event could cause Gary will never go back to the Grand Canyon?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gary had a wonderful time. (B) Gary got scared when he tripped near the canyon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Gary got scared when he tripped near the canyon, it could cause him to develop a fear of heights or a fear of the Grand Canyon specifically, which would make him hesitant to return. This is a more plausible answer than A, as having a wonderful time would likely make Gary want to return to the Grand Canyon in the future."}}
{"Q": "Natasha wanted become a news anchor. Which event could cause Natasha was thrilled when she landed her dream job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She went in for an interview one evening. (B) Natasha went to broadcasting school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She went in for an interview one evening.\nExplanation: Landing a dream job as a news anchor would most likely be the result of a successful job interview. Therefore, it is more plausible that Natasha would be thrilled after receiving a job offer following an interview, rather than simply attending broadcasting school."}}
{"Q": "Jim was exhausted from the night before. Which event could cause When he received his grade the next day, he was surprised to get a B?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim took his test after cramming because he was tired. (B) He was studying all night long.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jim took his test after cramming because he was tired.\nExplanation: If Jim was exhausted from the night before, it is more plausible that he did not study all night long but instead tried to cram before the test. This could have led to him being surprised to receive a B grade, as he may have expected a lower grade due to his lack of preparation."}}
{"Q": "My husband made chicken for dinner. Which event could cause He put it back in the oven and it came out fine?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We wanted to eat but the chicken wasn't done. (B) My husband burnt it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If the chicken wasn't done, it would make sense for him to put it back in the oven to finish cooking. If he burnt it, it would not come out fine after being put back in the oven. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mark was with his son at the library. Which event could cause Mark thanked the man as his son picked a toy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The librarian showed Mark's son, some toys. (B) A stranger dropped a toy and Mark told him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The librarian showed Mark's son some toys.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Mark would thank the librarian for showing his son some toys rather than a stranger dropping a toy. Additionally, it is common for libraries to have toys or activities for children, so it would not be unusual for the librarian to show Mark's son some options."}}
{"Q": "I was sitting at home studying today. Which event could cause I told him he should never put his home address on his business card?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Suddenly my husband got tons of lice. (B) A customer came looking for him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. A customer came looking for him.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a customer came looking for the person rather than the sudden occurrence of the husband getting tons of lice. The advice about not putting home address on business cards is related to privacy and safety concerns, which could be a reason why a customer came looking for the person."}}
{"Q": "Anna went for a run on a cold day. Which event could cause The oil helped heal Anna's sore, chapped lips?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Afterwards she stopped at the tire store. (B) Anna asked another runner what to do about chapped lips.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Anna asked another runner what to do about chapped lips.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anna sought advice from another runner about how to treat her chapped lips after her run, rather than stopping at a tire store where she would not have access to lip balm or other remedies for chapped lips. Additionally, seeking advice from another runner who may have experienced similar issues while running is a more logical course of action."}}
{"Q": "Kelly decided to try out for a game show. Which event could cause She was so excited to be on the show?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly made it on the game show's audience. (B) Kelly was excepted on a show.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Kelly was accepted on a show.\nExplanation: Being accepted on a game show would be a significant accomplishment and a reason for excitement. Being in the audience would not necessarily be as exciting as being a contestant on the show. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My mom asked for the car keys. Which event could cause We requested a plumber to remove the pipe in order to get it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My mom then started the car. (B) I threw the keys and they fell in the toilet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that my mom started the car after receiving the keys, rather than me throwing the keys and them falling in the toilet, which would require a plumber to remove the pipe."}}
{"Q": "Sarah loves to go hiking. Which event could cause She made it to the pharmacy in time to apply some rash ointment?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sarah had a blast. (B) Sarah , went for her daily hike and step in poison sumac.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sarah, went for her daily hike and step in poison sumac.\nExplanation: Poison sumac is a plant that can cause a rash when it comes into contact with the skin. If Sarah stepped in poison sumac during her hike, she may have developed a rash and needed to apply some rash ointment from the pharmacy. This event is more plausible than option (A) because it directly relates to hiking and the potential hazards that come with it."}}
{"Q": "My mom bought a new hybrid. Which event could cause She's very happy about her purchase?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My new hybrid runs great. (B) My mom says her gas mileage has doubled.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The fact that her gas mileage has doubled is a significant benefit of owning a hybrid car, and it is likely to make her very happy about her purchase. It also suggests that she is saving money on gas, which is another reason to be satisfied with her decision. While running great is also important, it is not as specific to the benefits of owning a hybrid car and may not be as likely to cause her to be very happy."}}
{"Q": "Tom took his girlfriend out for her first fishing experience. Which event could cause Tom was proud of her even though he felt defeated?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) That day Tom caugh no fish and his girlfriend caught three. (B) Tom caught three fish  and his girlfriend didn't catch anything.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: Tom would be proud of his girlfriend for catching three fish on her first fishing experience, even if he didn't catch any himself. This shows that he was able to teach her the skills needed to catch fish and that she was able to apply them successfully. Despite his own lack of success, he would still feel a sense of accomplishment in seeing his girlfriend enjoy the experience and catch fish."}}
{"Q": "There was a big sports game. Which event could cause The police had to get involved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A fight broke out in the field. (B) The sports teams started fighting.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A fight broke out in the field.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a fight broke out in the field between players or fans, which could escalate and require police intervention. While it is possible for sports teams to fight, it is less likely to happen during a big game and would likely be handled by referees or coaches before it escalated to the point of police involvement."}}
{"Q": "This winter I went skiing in Alaska with my friend. Which event could cause I cannot wait to go again next year?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The slopes had so much fun on us. (B) My friend and I had a great time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The slopes had so much fun on us.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it focuses on the skiing experience itself, rather than just the enjoyment of being with a friend. If the slopes were particularly challenging or exciting, it could create a sense of anticipation and excitement to return and conquer them again next year. Additionally, the use of the phrase \"had so much fun on us\" suggests that the slopes provided a unique and enjoyable experience, further supporting this answer choice."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy worked for weeks on a sculpture. Which event could cause Jimmy sighed in relief when he saw nothing had been broken?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jimmy walked by the sculpture and almost tipped it over. (B) Suddenly, Jimmy stumbled and knocked into his sculpture which shattered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Jimmy walked by the sculpture and almost tipped it over, he would have been relieved to see that nothing had been broken. This event implies that Jimmy was able to catch the sculpture before it fell and that it remained intact. On the other hand, if Jimmy stumbled and knocked into his sculpture which shattered, he would not have sighed in relief but rather would have been upset and disappointed that his hard work had been destroyed. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Buddy had a problem drinking. Which event could cause With their assistance, Buddy finally got sober?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Buddy visited the local Alcoholics Drink Here Hut. (B) Buddy's friends held an intervention, and they all decided they would help him quit drinking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Buddy's friends held an intervention, and they all decided they would help him quit drinking.\n\nExplanation: While visiting a local Alcoholics Drink Here Hut may provide some resources and support for someone struggling with alcohol addiction, it is more likely that the support and encouragement of close friends and family would have a greater impact on Buddy's decision to get sober. Holding an intervention is a common and effective way to show someone the impact their addiction is having on themselves and those around them, and to offer them a path towards recovery with the help of their loved ones."}}
{"Q": "Sarah wanted to mail a card. Which event could cause Sarah delivered her letter herself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sarah decided she would mail it instead. (B) Sarah decided she would bring it in person instead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sarah decided she would bring it in person instead.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that Sarah had a specific reason for wanting to deliver the letter herself, such as wanting to ensure it arrived on time or wanting to add a personal touch. Option (A) simply suggests that Sarah changed her mind about how to send the letter, without any clear reason why."}}
{"Q": "Bob opened the hood of his car to add more oil. Which event could cause It worked well but his hands got very messy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob replaced his oil. (B) Bob poured the oil perfectly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Bob replaced his oil.\nExplanation: When replacing oil, it is common for some oil to spill or drip onto the engine or other parts of the car, which can make hands messy. Pouring the oil perfectly (option B) would not necessarily cause messy hands, as long as Bob used a funnel and was careful not to spill any oil. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Martha had been cooking all day. Which event could cause Martha was disappointed, and ordered take-out that night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The food got stored. (B) She followed recipes, but nothing turned out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She followed recipes, but nothing turned out.\nExplanation: Martha had been cooking all day, which indicates that she had put in a lot of effort and time into cooking. If the food got stored, it would not necessarily cause disappointment as it could be eaten later. However, if she followed recipes but nothing turned out, it would mean that all her efforts went in vain, and she would be disappointed with the outcome. This disappointment could lead her to order take-out that night. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She was supposed to be at work but was at home sick. Which event could cause To be thinking of Christmas in July made her feel very depressed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was so lonely at home. (B) She started shopping online for Halloween costumes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was so lonely at home.\n\nExplanation: Feeling sick and having to stay home from work can already be a lonely and isolating experience. Thinking of Christmas in July, which is typically associated with family gatherings and social events, may have amplified her feelings of loneliness and depression. Shopping for Halloween costumes, on the other hand, is unlikely to have a significant impact on her emotional state in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Terry went to the car dealership and bought a new car. Which event could cause Terry's car was ruined, but he was thankful to be alive?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terry drove off the lot and immediately was hit by another car. (B) On his way home Terry saw a car hit head on.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because Terry just bought a new car and it is more likely that he would be driving it off the lot when the accident happened. Option B is also possible, but it does not necessarily involve Terry's car being ruined. Additionally, Terry's gratitude for being alive would be more understandable if he was directly involved in the accident, which is more likely in option A."}}
{"Q": "Bob used plastic grocery bags to go shopping. Which event could cause Bob used his reusable grocery bags to go shopping?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He learned they weren't good for the environment so got some reusable ones. (B) Bob bought cereal on the way home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Bob learned that plastic grocery bags are harmful to the environment and decided to switch to reusable bags. This is a common reason why people switch to reusable bags, as they are a more sustainable option. Buying cereal on the way home would not necessarily prompt Bob to switch to reusable bags."}}
{"Q": "Fred was in a crowd at a train station one day. Which event could cause Right before it hit the man, the train came to a halt so the man ran?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Fred saw a man fall onto the train tracks. (B) A man jumped into the station.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Fred saw a man fall onto the train tracks.\nExplanation: If Fred saw a man fall onto the train tracks, it would make sense that the train would come to a halt to avoid hitting the man. The man would then run to safety once the train stopped. On the other hand, if a man jumped into the station, it is unlikely that the train would come to a sudden halt and the man would run."}}
{"Q": "Alicia was excited to get a new neighbor. Which event could cause Alicia was disappointed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The old neighbor never worked a jobs and was home. (B) Alicia's neighbor was very rude to her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Alicia's neighbor was very rude to her.\nExplanation: If Alicia's new neighbor turned out to be very rude to her, it would be a plausible reason for her to be disappointed. This would be a negative experience for Alicia and would not live up to her excitement of having a new neighbor. On the other hand, the fact that the old neighbor never worked a job and was always home may not necessarily be a disappointment for Alicia, as it does not directly affect her relationship with her neighbor."}}
{"Q": "Emma had to go away for a few months. Which event could cause When she got home, she gave him the journal to read?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Emma recorded her journey in a journal. (B) Emma didn't have a journal to show her boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Emma recorded her journey in a journal.\nExplanation: If Emma recorded her journey in a journal, it would make sense for her to give it to her boyfriend to read when she got home. It would be a way for her to share her experiences with him and for him to feel connected to her while she was away. On the other hand, if Emma didn't have a journal to show her boyfriend, it wouldn't make sense for her to give him one that didn't exist. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Allison was always distracted while driving. Which event could cause Allison learned to always be attentive while driving?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Allison hit a pole and damaged her front bumper. (B) made it home safely.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Allison hitting a pole and damaging her front bumper could cause her to learn to always be attentive while driving.\nExplanation: A car accident can be a wake-up call for drivers to take driving more seriously and pay closer attention to the road. The damage to her car and the potential harm to herself or others could be a strong motivator for Allison to become a more attentive driver. On the other hand, making it home safely does not necessarily provide a negative consequence for her distracted driving behavior, so it may not be as effective in changing her habits."}}
{"Q": "Jason felt overwhelmed by math class. Which event could cause The tutor suggested they work on time management?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jason's sports got in the way of studying math. (B) Jason then became a tutor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Jason's sports got in the way of studying math, it could have caused him to feel overwhelmed and struggle with time management. The tutor suggesting they work on time management would be a logical solution to help Jason balance his sports and academic responsibilities. On the other hand, Jason becoming a tutor would not necessarily address his own struggles with time management and feeling overwhelmed in math class."}}
{"Q": "My son and daughter are best friends. Which event could cause I know that after each fight they always return to being best friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They fight a lot but then the make up soon after. (B) They fight a lot but then forget it soon after.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They fight a lot but then they make up soon after.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the siblings have a strong bond and are able to resolve their conflicts quickly. It also implies that they value their friendship and are willing to work through their disagreements. On the other hand, option B suggests that they may not care about their friendship as much and are quick to forget about their fights, which may not be a healthy dynamic for a close relationship."}}
{"Q": "Kevin dressed in his big brother's hand-me-down pants for church. Which event could cause He looked down to see the pants pooled around his ankles?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The pants Kevin wore were way too small on him. (B) They did not fit and was not happy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The pants Kevin wore were way too small on him.\n\nExplanation: If the pants were too small on Kevin, they would not fit properly and could easily fall down, causing them to pool around his ankles. This is a more plausible explanation than option B, which simply states that Kevin was not happy with the fit of the pants, but does not explain why they would fall down."}}
{"Q": "Tilly was visiting a farm. Which event could cause She even got to drink the fruits of her labor?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tilly worked picking apples and the farmer made apple juice. (B) Tilly worked hard to learn how to herd cows.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tilly worked picking apples and the farmer made apple juice.\n\nExplanation: If Tilly worked picking apples, it is plausible that the farmer would make apple juice from the apples she picked. This would allow Tilly to drink the fruits of her labor and enjoy the taste of freshly made apple juice. On the other hand, herding cows does not typically involve producing a drinkable product, so it is less likely that Tilly would get to drink the fruits of her labor in that scenario."}}
{"Q": "Cindy was baking sugar cookies for her mom. Which event could cause Cindy was left to eat the rest by herself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cindy was on a diet so she only ate one cookie. (B) Cindy's mom took a tin of them to the neighbors.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Cindy's mom took a tin of them to the neighbors.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is common for people to share baked goods with their neighbors or friends. It is unlikely that Cindy would only eat one cookie if she was baking them for her mom, especially if she enjoyed them. Additionally, if Cindy was on a diet, she may not have even baked the cookies in the first place. Therefore, it is more likely that Cindy's mom took a tin of the cookies to share with others, leaving Cindy to eat the rest by herself."}}
{"Q": "Joe is packing the last of the items he needs for his trip to the bay. Which event could cause At last, he's on his way to his destination?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe can hardly wait to leave. (B) Joe finally got his first bag in his car.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Joe finally got his first bag in his car.\nExplanation: This event indicates that Joe has finished packing and is ready to leave. It is a concrete action that shows progress towards his goal of leaving for his trip. Therefore, it is more plausible that this event would cause Joe to feel like he is finally on his way to his destination. Choice A, on the other hand, only indicates Joe's eagerness to leave but does not necessarily mean that he has started his journey."}}
{"Q": "Bob used plastic grocery bags to go shopping. Which event could cause Bob continued to use his plastic grocery bags to go shopping?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His store never had the reusable ones. (B) He always had the reusable ones.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Bob's store never had the reusable bags available, he would have no other option but to continue using the plastic grocery bags. This is a more plausible answer as it is common for some stores to not offer reusable bags or to have limited availability. On the other hand, if Bob always had the reusable bags, it would not make sense for him to continue using the plastic bags unless he preferred them for some reason."}}
{"Q": "Sean took his girlfriend to the beach one day. Which event could cause All of the sand came out?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When leaving, Sam shook their beach towels. (B) Sean got beat up everywhere.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. When leaving, Sam shook their beach towels.\nExplanation: When leaving the beach, it is common for people to shake their beach towels to remove any sand that may have accumulated on them. This could cause all of the sand to come out and scatter around, making it difficult to clean up. On the other hand, Sean getting beat up everywhere has nothing to do with the sand coming out, so it is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Bill is a great football player. Which event could cause Unlike most NFL players Bill is able to enjoy his old age?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got injured in his thirties. (B) He played football in college but opted for pro baseball.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Bill got injured in his thirties, it could have forced him to retire from football earlier than most NFL players. This would have given him more time to recover and take care of his body, which could lead to a healthier and more enjoyable old age. On the other hand, playing football in college and then opting for pro baseball would not necessarily have any impact on his ability to enjoy his old age."}}
{"Q": "Greg was building a new bathroom in his house. Which event could cause With Dan's help, the bathroom turned out beautiful?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan asked Greg for help. (B) Greg was renovating a bathroom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer because it states that Greg was renovating a bathroom, which implies that he needed help with the project. Dan's assistance likely contributed to the successful outcome of the project, resulting in a beautiful new bathroom. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that Dan was the one who needed help, which is not relevant to the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "Jordan was playing fetch with his dog. Which event could cause His dog splashed water all over his neighbor's porch?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was really rainy outside. (B) The dog jumped into the pool.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The dog jumped into the pool.\nExplanation: If it was really rainy outside, it is unlikely that Jordan would be playing fetch with his dog. On the other hand, if the dog jumped into the pool to retrieve the ball, it is possible that it could have splashed water all over the neighbor's porch if the pool was close enough to the porch. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gerald was at a restaurant and wanted seafood. Which event could cause He paid his bill and left the restaurant?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gerald spent all month to afford the meal. (B) Gerald ordered shrimp and was pleased with the lunch.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Gerald ordered shrimp and was pleased with the lunch.\nExplanation: If Gerald enjoyed his seafood lunch, he would likely pay his bill and leave the restaurant satisfied. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the immediate situation of paying the bill and leaving the restaurant."}}
{"Q": "Kate wanted to buy a new keyboard for her computer. Which event could cause Then she cancelled her order?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kate's brother told Kate that he got a spare keyboard that didn't work. (B) Kate's brother told Kate that he got a spare keyboard to give away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kate's brother told Kate that he got a spare keyboard that didn't work.\n\nExplanation: This event could cause Kate to cancel her order because she may have realized that she could save money by trying to fix her brother's spare keyboard instead of buying a new one. Additionally, if her brother's spare keyboard didn't work, she may have been discouraged from buying a new keyboard altogether. On the other hand, if her brother had a spare keyboard to give away, it wouldn't necessarily affect Kate's decision to buy a new keyboard."}}
{"Q": "Steve was always a shy guy. Which event could cause He ended up doing an excellent job and he was no longer shy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Steve was asked to MC his brothers wedding. (B) Steve started working on a solo project in one of his classes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Steve was asked to MC his brothers wedding.\nExplanation: Being asked to MC a wedding would require Steve to step out of his comfort zone and speak in front of a large group of people. This experience could help him build confidence and improve his public speaking skills, leading to him no longer being shy. On the other hand, working on a solo project in a class may not necessarily require Steve to interact with others or speak in front of a group, so it may not have as significant an impact on his shyness."}}
{"Q": "Cora went with her friends to a casino. Which event could cause Cora went back to the hotel alone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cora, won a lot of money all day at the casino slots. (B) Cora had a fight with her friends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Cora had a fight with her friends.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Cora would go back to the hotel alone if she had a fight with her friends rather than winning a lot of money. Winning money would likely make her want to stay and continue playing, while a fight with her friends could cause her to want to leave and be alone."}}
{"Q": "Joy was very pale. Which event could cause So she went on a beach vacation to California and got her tan?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joy wanted to get away. (B) Joy inessentialed to tan.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Joy inessentialed to tan.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joy wanted to get a tan while on her beach vacation in California, rather than simply wanting to get away causing her to become tan. Getting a tan is a common reason why people go to the beach, and it would explain why Joy, who was previously very pale, now has a tan."}}
{"Q": "I left my dog Max in the car with the windows down while I shopped. Which event could cause I finally went home and discovered Max sitting by my front door?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Max got tired of waiting and new how to get home as it was not far. He jumped out the window. (B) Max got tired of waiting and did not know how to get home as it was far. He jumped out the window.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Max got tired of waiting and knew how to get home as it was not far. He jumped out the window.\n\nExplanation: Dogs have a strong sense of smell and can remember familiar routes. If Max was familiar with the area and knew how to get home, it is possible that he jumped out of the car and made his way back home. However, if Max did not know the way home or if it was too far, it is unlikely that he would have been able to find his way back on his own. Additionally, it is important to never leave a dog unattended in a car, even with the windows down, as it can be dangerous and potentially deadly for the dog."}}
{"Q": "Eliza really wanted red slippers for her birthday. Which event could cause It looked great?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Eliza got red slippers. (B) Eliza got the slippers and wore them with a green dress.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Eliza's desire was for red slippers, so the event that would cause her to think \"It looked great\" would be if she actually received the red slippers she wanted. Option B mentions that she wore the slippers with a green dress, but it doesn't necessarily mean that she thought it looked great. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Noah was playing in his treehouse. Which event could cause He yelled for his dad?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a bird nowhere near the treehouse with Noah. (B) Noah found that he was scared to climb down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Noah found that he was scared to climb down.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is common for children to feel scared or nervous when climbing up or down from a treehouse. It is a situation where they may need the help or reassurance of an adult, such as their dad. On the other hand, a bird nowhere near the treehouse would not be a valid reason for Noah to yell for his dad."}}
{"Q": "There was a man with great vision. Which event could cause One night he saw some enemies coming and saved his troops?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He warned his soldiers of hot weather. (B) he tends to looks over things that looks suspicious..", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: The man's ability to look over things that look suspicious would have allowed him to notice the enemies approaching and take action to save his troops. This shows that his great vision was not just limited to his physical eyesight, but also his ability to perceive potential threats and act accordingly. Warning his soldiers of hot weather would not have been relevant to this particular situation."}}
{"Q": "Gina's phone was taken by the teacher. Which event could cause She stood in the bathroom stall on the verge of tears?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was a birthday present and brand new. (B) Gina's teacher was very upset at this.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was a birthday present and brand new.\nExplanation: Losing a brand new phone that was a birthday present would be a very upsetting experience for anyone, especially a student. It is understandable that Gina would be on the verge of tears in this situation. On the other hand, the teacher being upset may not necessarily cause Gina to feel this way, as it depends on the context and Gina's relationship with the teacher."}}
{"Q": "Julian began smoking cigarettes at a young age. Which event could cause Julian swore to himself that he would never use tobacco again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Julian got a really bad lung disease. (B) Julian developed a bad leg.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Julian got a really bad lung disease.\nExplanation: Since smoking is known to cause lung diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and emphysema, it is more plausible that Julian would swear off tobacco if he developed a serious lung disease. A bad leg may not be directly related to smoking and may not be a strong enough reason for Julian to quit smoking."}}
{"Q": "Jim moves into the same apartment complex as Jane. Which event could cause Jane calls the police and reports him ?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim was caught ignoring into Jane's apartment. (B) This made Jane feel uncomfortable.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jim was caught breaking into Jane's apartment.\n\nExplanation: Breaking into someone's apartment is a serious crime and can cause fear and discomfort for the victim. It is a plausible reason for Jane to call the police and report Jim's actions. Ignoring into someone's apartment without permission is a violation of privacy and can be considered a form of harassment. Therefore, it is more likely that Jane would call the police if Jim was caught breaking into her apartment rather than just making her feel uncomfortable."}}
{"Q": "Heidi worked as a volunteer at a soup kitchen near downtown. Which event could cause Heidi is still traumatized by what happened that day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Heidi was frightened by a cat who licked her. (B) Heidi had never seen drug and alcohol addiction so bad.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Heidi had never seen drug and alcohol addiction so bad.\nExplanation: Witnessing severe drug and alcohol addiction can be a traumatic experience, especially for someone who has never seen it before. It can be emotionally overwhelming and leave a lasting impact on a person's mental health. Therefore, it is more plausible that Heidi is still traumatized by what she saw at the soup kitchen rather than being frightened by a cat who licked her."}}
{"Q": "Craig has walked using crutches since he injured his leg. Which event could cause He decides never to leave home without crutches again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Craig ended up not using crutches and fell. (B) Craig decided to go out with his crutches and hurts himself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Craig decided to go out with his crutches and hurts himself.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly involves Craig's use of crutches and the consequences of not using them. If Craig were to go out without his crutches and hurt himself, it would reinforce the importance of using them for his safety and mobility. On the other hand, if Craig ended up not using his crutches and fell, it may not necessarily lead to him deciding to never leave home without them again."}}
{"Q": "Amy and her friend Beth went to the park on a summer afternoon. Which event could cause They had no suits, so they weren't able to enter the water park?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy and Beth hated to go to the waterslide. (B) they saw the new water slide was open and wanted to try it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Amy and Beth hated to go to the waterslide.\nExplanation: If Amy and Beth hated to go to the waterslide, then it is plausible that they did not bring their swimsuits with them. Therefore, they would not be able to enter the water park. On the other hand, if they saw the new water slide was open and wanted to try it, it does not necessarily mean that they did not have their swimsuits with them. They could have brought them but still not be able to enter the water park for other reasons such as not having enough money to pay for admission."}}
{"Q": "Donnie joined a gang to infiltrate them. Which event could cause Donnie is glad to be done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gang life was a bad way to live. (B) Donnie is still in the special forces.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Gang life was a bad way to live.\nExplanation: Donnie joined the gang with the intention of infiltrating them, not to become a permanent member. It is likely that he found the gang life to be dangerous, immoral, and not aligned with his values. Therefore, he would be glad to be done with it once he had gathered the necessary information for his mission. On the other hand, option B is not a plausible answer as it suggests that Donnie is still in the military, which is unrelated to his mission of infiltrating a gang."}}
{"Q": "My dream school was Villanova University. Which event could cause In August, I went to Villanova and started my college life?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I applied to Ball State and was accepted. (B) I worked hard to get a scholarship there.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I worked hard to get a scholarship there.\nExplanation: If the dream school was Villanova University, it is more plausible that the student worked hard to get a scholarship there and was able to attend in August. Applying to Ball State and being accepted would not necessarily lead to attending Villanova."}}
{"Q": "Sue had a routine physical at her doctor's office. Which event could cause The results came back and she is very healthy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sue was nervous about the outcome of her tests. (B) The patient told her they had to run additional tests.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The doctor did not find any abnormalities or health issues during the physical exam.\nExplanation: If Sue's physical exam did not reveal any health issues or abnormalities, then it is likely that her results would come back indicating that she is very healthy. Nervousness or additional tests would not necessarily indicate good health."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was spending time with her friend. Which event could cause Her friend was annoyed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly wouldn't leave her mom's house after the third day. (B) Kelly kept talking about her new boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kelly kept talking about her new boyfriend.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Kelly's friend would be annoyed if Kelly kept talking about her new boyfriend, as it could be seen as monopolizing the conversation and not showing interest in her friend's life. On the other hand, Kelly staying at her mom's house for three days may not necessarily be a cause for annoyance, as it could be a normal visit or a planned stay."}}
{"Q": "Kim needed directions to a store. Which event could cause The phone had given her horribly wrong directions?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kim dialed a stranger for directions to the store. (B) She followed her GPS, but could not find the right store.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She followed her GPS, but could not find the right store.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the GPS gave her wrong directions rather than her dialing a stranger for directions. GPS systems are known to sometimes give incorrect directions, especially if the address or location is not updated or if there are changes in the roads or buildings in the area."}}
{"Q": "Jim was using a selfie stick. Which event could cause Jim eventually found it but it was destroyed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim lost his selfie stick. (B) Jim leaned the selfie stick out too far over the lake and dropped his floatie into the water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jim accidentally dropped his selfie stick into the water while leaning it out too far over the lake, rather than losing it and then finding it destroyed. This scenario also involves a potential risk of damage to the selfie stick due to water exposure, making it more likely that it would be destroyed."}}
{"Q": "I took my pile of change to an exchange machine. Which event could cause I used the money I got from the machine?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I turned it in for play money. (B) I had saved up for a year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I had saved up for a year.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person had been saving up their change for a year and decided to exchange it for cash rather than turning it in for play money. Play money is not a common use for exchanged coins, whereas saving up change is a common practice for many people."}}
{"Q": "Tina has two dogs. Which event could cause They became best friends and enjoy playing in the backyard together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tina had just gotten a puppy and was worried about how much work it would be. (B) Tina lets the dogs run around in her backyard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tina lets the dogs run around in her backyard.\nExplanation: Allowing the dogs to play together in the backyard provides an opportunity for them to bond and become friends. It is a common scenario for dogs to become friends when they spend time together and engage in playful activities. On the other hand, Tina's worry about getting a new puppy (option A) does not necessarily lead to the dogs becoming best friends."}}
{"Q": "I let my dog outside to go to the bathroom. Which event could cause I then dried him off and relaxed with my clean dog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He played in the sprinklers. (B) My dog jumped in a sand pit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If the dog played in the sprinklers, he would likely be wet and in need of drying off. However, if he jumped in a sand pit, he would likely be covered in sand and in need of a bath rather than just drying off. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The library at Ben's town was hosting a readathon for prizes. Which event could cause A few days later, he learned that he won the the prize?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ben forgot about the readathon. (B) Ben entered and prayed to win.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If Ben entered the readathon and actively participated by reading books, he would have a chance to win the prize. It is unlikely that he would win if he forgot about the event and did not participate. Praying to win may not guarantee a win, but actively participating would increase his chances. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kate wanted to buy a new keyboard for her computer. Which event could cause Then her keyboard arrived in the mail?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kate's boyfriend knew about it and ordered one online. (B) Kate shopped in the mall where it was cheaper.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Kate shopped for a new keyboard in the mall and purchased it, then it is likely that the keyboard would be shipped to her address. Therefore, it is more plausible that the keyboard arrived in the mail because she purchased it from a store rather than her boyfriend ordering it online without her knowledge."}}
{"Q": "Mable knew she couldn't mow her lawn at her advanced age. Which event could cause Mable shed a tear from the boy's kindness?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So the boy came over with his lawn mower and helped. (B) A boy forced Mable to mow the lawn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. So the boy came over with his lawn mower and helped.\nExplanation: Mable is unable to mow her lawn due to her advanced age, so it would be a kind gesture for a boy to come over and help her out. This act of kindness would likely bring tears to Mable's eyes as it shows that there are still good people in the world who are willing to help others in need. On the other hand, if a boy forced Mable to mow the lawn, it would be a cruel and heartless act that would not bring tears of joy to her eyes."}}
{"Q": "Tammy needed money badly. Which event could cause She made lots of money and ended up happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tammy got a new job. (B) Tammy got a job where she met lots of people.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tammy got a new job.\nExplanation: Getting a new job would provide Tammy with a steady source of income, which would help her alleviate her financial problems. If the job pays well, she would be able to make lots of money and end up happy. Meeting lots of people at a job (option B) may be beneficial for networking and socializing, but it does not necessarily guarantee making lots of money and being happy."}}
{"Q": "Fred wanted to take Sally on a fun date. Which event could cause Since she had so much fun, Sally said yes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) fred asked sally to get lost. (B) fred want to go dancing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Fred wanted to go dancing.\nExplanation: Going dancing is a fun and social activity that many people enjoy. It is a great way to spend time with someone and create a memorable experience. Sally may have said yes to Fred's invitation because she enjoys dancing and sees it as a fun date idea. On the other hand, if Fred had asked Sally to get lost, it would not have been a fun or enjoyable experience for her, and she would likely have said no."}}
{"Q": "Kyle dreaded starting high school. Which event could cause Kyle found that her masculine name wasn't uncool - it was popular?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kyle was a gender non-conforming kid. (B) Kyle thought he would be teased.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kyle thought he would be teased for having a masculine name, as many students worry about fitting in and being accepted by their peers in high school. It is less likely that Kyle was a gender non-conforming kid, as this would require more information about Kyle's gender identity and expression."}}
{"Q": "Nell's gym teacher asked the class to do calisthenics. Which event could cause The teacher told the class she used to weigh 400 pounds?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The class did the calisthenics and were physically exhausted. (B) She hid what calisthenics did for her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She hid what calisthenics did for her.\n\nExplanation: It is highly unlikely that the teacher revealing her past weight would be caused by the class doing calisthenics and getting physically exhausted. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. The teacher may have shared her personal story to inspire and motivate the class to work hard and achieve their fitness goals."}}
{"Q": "After the blizzard, I didn't know how I was going to shovel anything. Which event could cause So today, I borrowed his shovel and cleaned up the sidewalk?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My neighbor took it upon himself to clean up the sidewalk, allowing me to get to my bus and work on time. (B) I had no shovel, but I bought one from someone who did.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly addresses the problem of not having a shovel and finding a solution by purchasing one from someone who had one. It also shows the individual taking initiative to clean up the sidewalk themselves, rather than relying on someone else to do it for them. Option (A) is less likely because it relies on the neighbor taking it upon themselves to clean up the sidewalk, which may not always happen."}}
{"Q": "Allan is the pastor of the First Baptist Church in his town. Which event could cause We all sang The Old Rugged Cross instead of Happy Birthday?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided he wanted to sing Happy Birthday no matter what. (B) Allan led the service on Sunday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Allan led the service on Sunday.\nExplanation: As the pastor of the First Baptist Church, Allan would typically lead the service on Sunday. If he chose to include the hymn \"The Old Rugged Cross\" in the service instead of singing \"Happy Birthday\" for someone's birthday, it could be due to a variety of reasons such as the occasion not being significant enough to interrupt the regular order of service or the hymn being more appropriate for the theme of the service. It is unlikely that Allan would randomly decide to sing \"Happy Birthday\" no matter what, as it would not fit the context of a church service."}}
{"Q": "Ann loved cake. Which event could cause Ann felt insulted by the lady's offer?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ann gave the lady cake. (B) The lady gave Ann the free cake for a favor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The lady gave Ann the free cake for a favor.\nExplanation: If Ann loved cake, it is unlikely that she would feel insulted by receiving cake as a gift or offering. However, if the lady gave Ann the free cake as a favor, it could imply that the lady thinks Ann needs to be bribed or rewarded for her help, which could be insulting to Ann's character or abilities."}}
{"Q": "Neil had been journeying through Asia. Which event could cause His favorite moment was when he got to feed a baby koala bear?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Neil especially loved the flora and the fauna he had seen in China. (B) He stopped to take several pictures.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neil visited a wildlife sanctuary in Australia where he was able to feed a baby koala bear.\nExplanation: This event directly relates to Neil's favorite moment of feeding a baby koala bear. It is a plausible explanation as Australia is known for its unique wildlife, including koalas, and it is likely that Neil would have visited a wildlife sanctuary during his travels. Additionally, stopping to take pictures would not necessarily be Neil's favorite moment, as it does not involve a unique or memorable experience."}}
{"Q": "Timmy was jealous as he watched breakdancers on TV. Which event could cause Now Timmy is on TV breakdancing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Timmy watched videos on Youtube to learn to sing. (B) timmy worked on becoming a breakdancer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Timmy worked on becoming a breakdancer.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Timmy worked hard to become a breakdancer after feeling jealous watching others on TV. Watching videos on Youtube to learn to sing would not necessarily lead to Timmy becoming a breakdancer."}}
{"Q": "A fisherman was having no luck in one part of the lake. Which event could cause It landed with a splash and the fisherman waited?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fisherman went to a different area. (B) The fisherman wasn't able to catch a fish in forever.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The fisherman went to a different area.\nExplanation: If the fisherman was having no luck in one part of the lake, it would make sense for them to try a different area where there may be more fish. The fact that the fish landed with a splash and the fisherman waited suggests that they were successful in catching a fish in the new area. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any explanation for why the fisherman was not able to catch a fish."}}
{"Q": "Peter laces his shoes with only black laces. Which event could cause Peter won the lottery and is now retired at 45?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Peter decided not to try out for the lottery. (B) Peter bought a lottery ticket one day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Peter bought a lottery ticket one day.\nExplanation: Winning the lottery is a matter of chance, and buying a lottery ticket is a prerequisite for winning. Peter's choice of shoe laces has no bearing on his decision to buy a lottery ticket or his chances of winning. Therefore, it is more plausible that Peter won the lottery after buying a ticket rather than deciding not to try out for it."}}
{"Q": "Tom was a bull rider by trade. Which event could cause Every night he couldn't wait for the next day to ride once again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He kept getting thrown off by the bull. (B) Horse riding was also his passion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Horse riding was also his passion.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's love for horse riding and bull riding would make him excited for the next day to ride again, rather than constantly getting thrown off by the bull. Additionally, if he kept getting thrown off, it would likely cause frustration and discouragement rather than excitement."}}
{"Q": "Brad was gazing in the fountain downtown. Which event could cause Then Brad walked away, whistling happily?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Brad made a wish on a shooting star. (B) Brad made a wish with a penny.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Brad made a wish with a penny.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Brad made a wish with a penny in the fountain, as this is a common tradition and belief that throwing a penny in the fountain and making a wish will bring good luck. It is unlikely that Brad saw a shooting star in the middle of the day downtown, making option A less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Dan needed a new router. Which event could cause The router worked excellently and Dan was happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan went to the store to get a table. (B) Dan went to the store to get a router.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Dan needed a new router, so going to the store to get a router would be the most plausible event that could cause the router to work excellently and make Dan happy. Going to the store to get a table would not have any impact on the router's performance."}}
{"Q": "Ida had a falling out with her friends. Which event could cause Her friends forgave her and became her friends again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ida was kind to her friends. (B) After a few days, Ida went up to her friends and apologized for what she said.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) After a few days, Ida went up to her friends and apologized for what she said.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ida's friends would forgive her and become her friends again if she apologized for what she said and showed remorse for her actions. Being kind to her friends may help, but it is not a guarantee that they will forgive her. Apologizing and taking responsibility for her actions is a more direct and effective way to repair the relationship."}}
{"Q": "Martha was a terrible cook and her boyfriend knew it. Which event could cause Martha became an expert seamstress after a while?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Martha's boyfriend suggested she learn sewing instead. (B) Martha practiced her cooking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Martha's boyfriend suggested she learn sewing instead.\nExplanation: There is no direct correlation between practicing cooking and becoming an expert seamstress. However, if Martha's boyfriend suggested she learn sewing instead, it is possible that she took an interest in it and practiced it regularly, eventually becoming an expert. It is also possible that Martha had a natural talent for sewing that she was not aware of, and her boyfriend's suggestion helped her discover it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "While I was in college, I had met an older man. Which event could cause I have fond memories of that time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He helped me flunk out of all my classes. (B) I went on several dates and eventually married the older man.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I went on several dates and eventually married the older man.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests a positive outcome from the relationship with the older man. Going on several dates and eventually marrying him would likely create fond memories of that time in college. On the other hand, option (A) suggests a negative outcome and would not likely create fond memories."}}
{"Q": "Brad stops and gets a 44 oz mountain dew every day. Which event could cause Brad passes away?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Brad had a really bad diabetes. (B) Brad suffers from diabetes at a young age, but never gives up his habit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: Consuming a 44 oz mountain dew every day can lead to a high intake of sugar and calories, which can increase the risk of developing diabetes. If Brad already has diabetes and continues to consume sugary drinks, it can worsen his condition and lead to complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, and even death. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it highlights the potential consequences of consuming sugary drinks regularly, especially for individuals with diabetes."}}
{"Q": "Peanut was a hungry pitbull. Which event could cause Peanut is not hungry anymore?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Peanut's owners forgot to give him food. (B) Peanut ate his food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Peanut ate his food.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Peanut's hunger would be satisfied if he ate his food rather than his owners forgetting to give him food. As a pitbull, Peanut would have a strong appetite and would likely eat his food as soon as it was given to him."}}
{"Q": "Fred and his girlfriend rose were happy it was Valentine's Day. Which event could cause The two then went for a walk in the park?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fred and his girlfriend broke up. (B) Fred and his girlfriend went to dinner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Fred and his girlfriend went to dinner.\nExplanation: Since it was Valentine's Day, it is more likely that Fred and his girlfriend would celebrate the occasion by going out for a romantic dinner. This would then lead to them taking a walk in the park afterwards to enjoy the evening together. On the other hand, if they had broken up, it is unlikely that they would be spending time together and going for a walk in the park. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "One day a stranger came to our farm. Which event could cause The next morning the man was gone but so were two of our horses?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man seemed nice, and even agreed to help Pa fix the fence. (B) He seemed trustworthy but I was trusting of him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The fact that the stranger seemed trustworthy and that the narrator was trusting of him could have led to the theft of the horses. It is possible that the stranger gained the trust of the family and used that trust to steal the horses during the night. This scenario is more plausible than the man being nice and helping with the fence, as there is no clear connection between that event and the theft of the horses."}}
{"Q": "Al rode his bike to the store for candy. Which event could cause That night, Al cheered himself up by gorging on candy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) While on his way home, someone stole all of Al's candy. (B) Al fell off his bike and scraped his knee on the way home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If someone stole all of Al's candy on his way home, he would be upset and less likely to gorge on candy that night. On the other hand, if he successfully bought candy and made it home, but then decided to cheer himself up by eating more candy, that would be a more plausible reason for his behavior."}}
{"Q": "Sarah did not get a good night's sleep. Which event could cause She woke up feeling much better?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sarah decided to go to bed later. (B) Sarah decided to go to bed earlier.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sarah decided to go to bed earlier.\nExplanation: If Sarah did not get a good night's sleep, it is more likely that going to bed earlier would help her feel better in the morning. Going to bed later would only exacerbate the problem and make her feel even more tired. Getting enough sleep is important for overall health and well-being, so it is always a good idea to prioritize getting enough rest."}}
{"Q": "Ricky fell while hiking in the woods. Which event could cause He was relieved to find out he was wrong?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ricky thought his ankle had been sprained, but the doctor said it was broken. (B) Rick thought he had broken his ankle, but it was only sprained.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Ricky thought his ankle had been sprained but the doctor said it was broken, he would be relieved to find out that it was not as serious as he initially thought. On the other hand, if he thought he had broken his ankle but it was only sprained, he would not be relieved as he would still have to deal with the pain and recovery time associated with a sprain. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A man wanted to send text messages faster. Which event could cause He soon improved his texting speed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found an app that helped text whole words. (B) He practiced calling more.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He found an app that helped text whole words.\n\nExplanation: Finding an app that helps text whole words would be a more plausible answer as it directly addresses the man's desire to send text messages faster. This app would allow him to type out full words with just a few keystrokes, saving him time and increasing his texting speed. Practicing calling more would not necessarily improve his texting speed, as it is a different skill altogether."}}
{"Q": "Charles was an everyday type of guy. Which event could cause He proved his innocence in court and is back from jail after 3 months?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Charles looked like wanted criminal. (B) Charles was a victim of robbery.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Charles looked like wanted criminal.\nExplanation: If Charles looked like a wanted criminal, he may have been mistakenly identified and arrested. If he was able to prove his innocence in court, it would be a significant event that could cause him to be back from jail after 3 months. On the other hand, being a victim of robbery may not necessarily lead to Charles being in jail, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Nancy had a problem with her bad breath. Which event could cause After the visit, her breath improved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She started using breath mints. (B) Nancy visited the dentist and got her teeth cleaned.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Nancy visited the dentist and got her teeth cleaned.\nExplanation: Bad breath can be caused by a buildup of bacteria in the mouth, which can be removed through regular dental cleanings. Using breath mints may temporarily mask the odor, but it does not address the underlying cause of the bad breath. Therefore, it is more plausible that Nancy's breath improved after visiting the dentist and getting her teeth cleaned."}}
{"Q": "Maggie was on a fun trip to the beach. Which event could cause She ended up missing out on the whole trip?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Maggie fell and sprained her ankle. (B) Maggie got sick on her last day there and had to stay in her room.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Maggie fell and sprained her ankle.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Maggie missing out on the whole trip was caused by an injury rather than getting sick on the last day. If Maggie sprained her ankle, she would not be able to participate in any beach activities and would have to stay in her room to rest and recover. On the other hand, if she got sick on the last day, she would have still been able to enjoy the majority of her trip."}}
{"Q": "Tina had to write a great essay to get into college. Which event could cause She was delighted to hear the college had accepted her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She spent weeks writing her essay. (B) Tina wrote an excellent essay for a school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Tina wrote an excellent essay for a school.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it directly relates to the outcome of being accepted into college. If Tina wrote an excellent essay for a school, it is likely that she also wrote a great essay for her college application. Therefore, it makes sense that she would be delighted to hear that she was accepted into college. Spending weeks writing her essay may have contributed to her success, but it is not a direct cause of her acceptance."}}
{"Q": "The family decided to take a trip to the beach one hot summer day. Which event could cause Low and behold the neighbors parked next to them, excited to see them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It started raining so they went to museum instead. (B) They saw the neighbors unpacking their vehicle too.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They saw the neighbors unpacking their vehicle too.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is common for people to run into their neighbors while on vacation or at popular tourist destinations. It is unlikely that a sudden rainstorm would cause the neighbors to appear next to them."}}
{"Q": "It was 10 PM on a summer night. Which event could cause Unable to sleep, Gina lay in bed with nothing to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) But it was so cold it was easy to sleep. (B) Gina's strict bedtime was 9:30 PM, even in summer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) There were loud fireworks going off outside, keeping Gina awake.\nExplanation: Fireworks are a common occurrence during the summer, especially around holidays like the Fourth of July. The loud noises and bright lights can be disruptive to sleep, making it difficult for someone to fall asleep or stay asleep. This scenario is more plausible than option (A), which suggests it was cold and easy to sleep, or option (B), which implies Gina's inability to sleep is due to a strict bedtime."}}
{"Q": "Jake was walking home from school. Which event could cause Jake ran home he was fine but frightened?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jake was chased by a dog. (B) Jake saw some friends down the street.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jake was chased by a dog.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jake would run home if he was chased by a dog and felt frightened. Seeing friends down the street would not typically cause someone to run home in fear."}}
{"Q": "Kyle collected many things. Which event could cause Kyle was really into Marvel heros?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kyle read a Marvel comic. (B) Kyle gave away his marvel action figures.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Kyle read a Marvel comic.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kyle became interested in Marvel heroes after reading a Marvel comic, as comics are a common way for people to become interested in superheroes. Giving away his Marvel action figures would suggest that he lost interest in them, rather than becoming more interested in them."}}
{"Q": "A man looked at a rock face and decided to climb it. Which event could cause The man climbed faster to get off the mountain as soon as possible?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rocks were coming up it. (B) He was getting tired and wanted to be done.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rocks were coming up it.\nExplanation: If rocks were coming up the rock face, it would be a dangerous situation for the climber. The falling rocks could cause injury or even death. Therefore, the climber would want to climb faster to get off the mountain as soon as possible and avoid the danger. On the other hand, if the climber was just getting tired and wanted to be done, he could take a break or slow down without any immediate danger."}}
{"Q": "Eric went to a restaurant with his girlfriend. Which event could cause Eric's girlfriend broke her tooth on the ring, but said yes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eric and his girlfriend got into a fight and broke up. (B) Eric had the waiter bury an engagement ring in the bread pudding dessert.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If Eric had the waiter bury an engagement ring in the bread pudding dessert, it is possible that his girlfriend could have broken her tooth on the ring while eating the dessert. This scenario is more plausible than Eric and his girlfriend getting into a fight and breaking up, which would not be related to the ring or the restaurant."}}
{"Q": "Nina wanted a nice Halloween costume. Which event could cause Nina was excited?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nina bought a witch costume. (B) She found one that she found alright.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Nina bought a witch costume.\nExplanation: Since Nina wanted a nice Halloween costume, it is more plausible that she would be excited about finding and purchasing a costume that she really liked, rather than settling for one that she found just alright. Therefore, option A is the more likely event to cause Nina's excitement."}}
{"Q": "Ed the waiter took an order from a table. Which event could cause The man inspected one to see if it was crispy enough and it was?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The patron requested extra crispy fries. (B) The waiter brought salad.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The patron requested extra crispy fries.\nExplanation: If the patron specifically requested extra crispy fries, it would make sense for him to inspect one to ensure that they met his expectations. On the other hand, the arrival of a salad would not be related to the man inspecting a fry for crispiness. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Andrew wanted to plant an apple tree. Which event could cause Andrew was glad to see the tree growing in his backyard?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Andrew bought seeds but did not water the plant. (B) Andrew planted a seed from an apple.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Andrew planted a seed from an apple.\n\nExplanation: If Andrew planted a seed from an apple, it has the potential to grow into an apple tree. If he took care of the seed by watering it and providing it with the necessary nutrients, he would be glad to see the tree growing in his backyard. On the other hand, if he bought seeds but did not water the plant, the seeds would not grow, and he would not be happy to see the plant not growing. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ron wanted to get some fresh produce. Which event could cause Spaghetti squash turned out to be the best discovery he had ever had?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had read about making plain squash. (B) Ron purchased spaghetti squash.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ron purchased spaghetti squash.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ron discovered spaghetti squash was the best discovery he had ever had because he actually purchased it and tried it, rather than just reading about making plain squash. Trying a new type of produce and enjoying it is a common experience for many people, and it makes sense that this could be the reason for Ron's positive experience with spaghetti squash."}}
{"Q": "I went to my favorite candy store Which event could cause I have to decided to only eat candy in small amounts from now on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I got sick from eating not enough candy. (B) The price of my favorite candy was very high.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The price of my favorite candy was very high.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the high price of the favorite candy could cause the person to limit their candy consumption rather than getting sick from not eating enough candy. The high price may have made the person realize the cost of indulging in their favorite candy and prompted them to make a conscious decision to eat it in smaller amounts."}}
{"Q": "Ally heard chirping coming from the tree by the deck. Which event could cause She watched out the window as the mother came back to the nest?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ally looked outside to see unsupervised babies. (B) She saw a nest of swarming bees.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ally looked outside to see unsupervised babies.\nExplanation: The chirping sound coming from the tree suggests that there are baby birds in a nest. The fact that the mother bird returns to the nest implies that she is caring for her young. Therefore, it is more plausible that Ally saw unsupervised baby birds rather than a nest of swarming bees."}}
{"Q": "My wife needed a pair of boots for the winter. Which event could cause Then she bought four more pairs?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When my wife went to the shoe store she found a deal on boot for me. (B) When I went to the store I found a deal on boots for me.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If my wife went to the shoe store and found a deal on boots for herself, it is more plausible that she would end up buying more pairs for herself. If I found a deal on boots for myself, it would not necessarily lead to my wife buying more pairs for herself. Therefore, option A is a more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "I just completed my first marathon today. Which event could cause I'm really disappointed in myself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I've trained before but couldn't walk the entire way. (B) I never trained before that and walked the entire way.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If the person had trained before but still couldn't walk the entire way, they may feel disappointed in themselves for not being able to meet their own expectations despite putting in effort and time to prepare for the marathon. On the other hand, if they never trained before and still managed to walk the entire way, they may feel proud of themselves for completing the marathon despite not having prior experience or preparation."}}
{"Q": "It was Jay's 26th birthday, and it started off like any other day. Which event could cause He could not believe it when they all surprised him with the gift?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jay's friends surprised him with a big gift. (B) Jay's friends got tickets for his rival sports team.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jay's friends surprised him with a big gift.\nExplanation: Since it was Jay's birthday, it is plausible that his friends would surprise him with a gift. This is a common tradition on birthdays, and it would be a pleasant surprise for Jay. On the other hand, option B about getting tickets for his rival sports team does not necessarily relate to Jay's birthday and may not be a surprise for him. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Beth is one of the best runners on her track team. Which event could cause Beth regrets not being more focused and letting her team down?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Beth met a boy and they practiced together. (B) Beth's mood was bad today and she didn't go running.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Beth's mood was bad today and she didn't go running.\nExplanation: If Beth didn't go running because of her bad mood, she would have let her team down by not showing up for practice or a competition. This could have affected her performance in future events and caused her to regret not being more focused on her responsibilities as a team member. While practicing with a boy may have been a distraction, it is not necessarily a situation that would cause Beth to regret letting her team down."}}
{"Q": "Tyler's dad took him to a baseball game. Which event could cause Once he got his hotdog, he was happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was not impressed by the game. (B) Tyler is so energized and hungry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tyler is so energized and hungry.\nExplanation: It is common for people to feel hungry and energized after physical activity or excitement, such as watching a baseball game. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tyler's hunger and excitement caused him to be happy after getting his hotdog, rather than him being unimpressed by the game."}}
{"Q": "When Johnny received his journalism degree he doubted he'd find a job. Which event could cause The editor offered him a reporting position that same day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Johnny got refused and interview with an editor. (B) When Johnny met with Sublime Ink he was hired the day after his interview.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer as it states that Johnny was hired the day after his interview with Sublime Ink. This suggests that he impressed the editor during the interview and was offered a job immediately. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that Johnny was rejected for an interview, which would make it unlikely for him to receive a job offer from the same editor on the same day."}}
{"Q": "Linda was sketching in public. Which event could cause But she felt devastated when she overheard comments about her sketch?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People criticized Lindas sketch. (B) Linda prevented herself from eavesdropping on the next table over.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. People criticized Linda's sketch.\nExplanation: If people criticized Linda's sketch while she was sketching in public, it could cause her to feel devastated when she overhears their comments. This is a plausible scenario as criticism can be hurtful, especially when it is unsolicited and unexpected. On the other hand, option B is not a plausible answer as preventing oneself from eavesdropping on the next table over would not have any direct impact on Linda's emotional state."}}
{"Q": "Kat loved to play with insects. Which event could cause Kat then decided it'd be best to leave the moths be?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kate killed the insects. (B) Kat got hugged by a moth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kat would decide to leave the moths be if she had a positive interaction with one, such as getting hugged by a moth. This could lead her to develop empathy for the insects and realize that they are not just objects to play with, but living creatures that deserve respect and care. Killing the insects would not necessarily lead to this realization and could even reinforce the idea that insects are disposable."}}
{"Q": "Our two year old granddaughter is visiting from New York this weekend. Which event could cause My wife is thrilled to see our first grandchild?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My wife bought new child clothes. (B) Since my wife and I live with her, we see her every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Since my wife and I live with our granddaughter, seeing her every day is not a special event that would cause my wife to be thrilled. However, having our two-year-old granddaughter visit from New York is a rare and exciting event that would likely cause my wife to be thrilled, regardless of whether or not she bought new child clothes. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Cindy is a tennis player. Which event could cause Cindy won the challenge?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cindy practiced once a month for a competition. (B) Cindy practiced everyday for a competition.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Cindy would win the challenge if she practiced everyday for the competition. Consistent practice and training would improve her skills and increase her chances of winning. Practicing only once a month would not provide enough preparation for a competition."}}
{"Q": "Felix was playing in the school playground. Which event could cause After a few hours, Felix began to feel a little better?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Felix fell off the wing. (B) Felix played all day and had tons of fun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Felix fell off the swing, it is possible that he got hurt or injured himself. After a few hours, he may have received medical attention or rested, which could have caused him to feel a little better. On the other hand, if Felix played all day and had tons of fun, it is unlikely that he would feel better after just a few hours, as he would likely be tired and need more time to rest and recover. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was skiing for the first time. Which event could cause He was a little shaky, but he got off the t-bar without falling?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom decided to give up. (B) Tom was very nervous.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom was very nervous.\nExplanation: It is common for first-time skiers to feel nervous and shaky, especially when using a t-bar lift for the first time. However, if Tom had decided to give up, he would not have been able to get off the t-bar without falling. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jim was at Costco. Which event could cause He ate so much that he skipped dinner that night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They had no samples. (B) Jim loved free samples.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jim loved free samples.\nExplanation: If Jim loved free samples, it is more plausible that he ate so much at Costco that he skipped dinner that night. It is common for people to indulge in free samples at Costco, and if Jim enjoyed them, he may have eaten more than he intended to. On the other hand, if there were no samples available, it is less likely that Jim would have overeaten to the point of skipping dinner."}}
{"Q": "I had a science test yesterday and was so nervous. Which event could cause However to my surprise the test wasn't that bad?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I took the science test. (B) I almost made myself sing from the nerves.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I took the science test.\nExplanation: Taking the science test is the most plausible event that could cause the surprise that the test wasn't that bad. The nervousness before the test could have made the person doubt their abilities and expect the worst, but actually taking the test and realizing it wasn't as difficult as anticipated would be a pleasant surprise. Option B, almost making oneself sing from nerves, is not directly related to the outcome of the test and therefore less likely to cause surprise about the test's difficulty."}}
{"Q": "Lydia had a strange dream last night. Which event could cause Lydia felt relieved when she realized it was just a dream?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lydia dreamed she was married to her awful ex-boyfriend. (B) Lydia dreamed she was married to a sexy actor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Lydia would feel relieved when she realized that dreaming about being married to her awful ex-boyfriend was just a dream. This is because she would not want to be in a relationship with someone who she considers to be awful. Dreaming about being married to a sexy actor may be a pleasant dream, but it would not necessarily cause relief when realizing it was just a dream."}}
{"Q": "Sammy was at an outdoor mall and was starting to feel hungry. Which event could cause After Sammy finished eating there, she left feeling regretful?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sammy went to get food. (B) Sammy's friend decided to go to a sketchy buffet where the food looked questionable.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If Sammy's friend decided to go to a sketchy buffet where the food looked questionable, it is more likely that Sammy would regret eating there due to the quality of the food. If Sammy simply went to get food, there is no indication that she would feel regretful after eating."}}
{"Q": "Amy hadn't slept well. Which event could cause Her mother saw her and yelled at her for drinking coffee?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy snuck into the kitchen and made herself carrot and celery sticks. (B) needing to stay awake, she decided to drink a cup of coffee.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) needing to stay awake, she decided to drink a cup of coffee.\nExplanation: If Amy hadn't slept well, she might have felt tired and needed to stay awake. In this case, she might have decided to drink a cup of coffee to help her stay alert. However, her mother might have been upset with her for drinking coffee because it could interfere with her sleep later on. On the other hand, it is less likely that her mother would yell at her for making carrot and celery sticks, as this is a healthy snack choice."}}
{"Q": "I came into class late one day. Which event could cause I did not get a very good grade on it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I had been busy writing a great research paper. (B) I missed the project instructions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I missed the project instructions.\nExplanation: If you came into class late and missed the project instructions, it is likely that you did not fully understand what was expected of you and may have missed important details or requirements. This could result in a lower grade on the project. While it is possible that you were busy writing a great research paper, this would not necessarily have a direct impact on your grade for a different assignment."}}
{"Q": "Fred woke up early. Which event could cause Fred spent the rest of his day watching old movies?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fred decided to call out sick. (B) Fred felt lazy and spent the day at home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Fred decided to call out sick.\nExplanation: If Fred woke up early but then decided to call out sick, it is plausible that he would spend the rest of his day at home watching old movies. He may not feel well enough to do anything else and watching movies could be a way to pass the time while he rests and recovers. On the other hand, if Fred simply felt lazy and stayed home, he may still have other things he could do or responsibilities to attend to, making it less likely that he would spend the entire day watching movies."}}
{"Q": "Bob began to lay tile in his bathroom as a part of remodeling. Which event could cause Bob bought different tiles and hoped that no one would notice?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob ran out of the exact color. (B) Some of the tiles were new.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Bob ran out of the exact color.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bob ran out of the exact color of tiles he needed and had to buy a different color to finish the job. It is unlikely that he would buy completely different tiles and hope that no one would notice, especially if he was remodeling his own bathroom and would have to live with the result."}}
{"Q": "Alana was traveling with the the girls to the islands. Which event could cause It was supposed to be a girls trip and the husband wasn't welcome?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One of Alana's friends left her husband behind. (B) Their husbands were not invited.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. One of Alana's friends left her husband behind.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that one of Alana's friends may have left her husband behind, while the other friends may have left their husbands at home as well. This would align with the idea that it was supposed to be a girls trip and the husbands were not welcome. Option B suggests that none of the husbands were invited, which may not be as likely if the group of friends is mixed gender and only Alana's husband was excluded."}}
{"Q": "We had a museum poster on our wall for Years. Which event could cause We put the old poster up in our bedroom?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The old museum poster was left at the old house when we moved. (B) We loved it so much we took it us when we moved.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) We loved it so much we took it with us when we moved.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for putting the old museum poster up in the bedroom is because the person or people who owned it loved it so much that they wanted to keep it with them even after moving to a new house. It is unlikely that they would have left it behind at the old house if they had enjoyed having it on their wall for years."}}
{"Q": "Ivan went to the zoo. Which event could cause Ivan climbed up and rode the elephant happily?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They asked if Ivan wanted to ride an horse. (B) he saw many different animals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Seeing many different animals at the zoo could have sparked Ivan's excitement and curiosity, leading him to climb up and ride the elephant happily. On the other hand, there is no clear connection between being offered to ride a horse and Ivan's decision to ride the elephant. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gina had been out of town for 2 weeks at her grandmother's house. Which event could cause Gina hadn't realized how much she missed in 2 weeks without cable?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina loved watching television at her grandmother's. (B) She didn't have a lot to do at her house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Gina loved watching television at her grandmother's.\n\nExplanation: If Gina loved watching television at her grandmother's, it is plausible that she didn't realize how much she missed in 2 weeks without cable because she was able to watch TV at her grandmother's house. On the other hand, choice B doesn't provide a clear reason why Gina wouldn't have realized how much she missed in 2 weeks without cable."}}
{"Q": "Cheyenne tried to keep up with her friend David as they walked. Which event could cause David was the only one who knew his way back to the car?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was important that Cheyenne not lose sight of David. (B) Cheyenne departed back and got separated from David.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Cheyenne departed back and got separated from David.\nExplanation: If Cheyenne decided to go back on her own and got separated from David, it would be difficult for her to find her way back to the car without David's help. This would cause David to be the only one who knew the way back to the car, making it important for Cheyenne to keep up with him. Option (A) is also plausible, but it does not necessarily explain why David was the only one who knew the way back to the car."}}
{"Q": "Frederick Thompson, a white kid, knew blacks used to be in slavery. Which event could cause Frederick started the History of Slavery in America Club on his campus?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Frederick was pleased more everytime he read about it. (B) Frederick was bothered more everytime he read about it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Frederick was bothered more every time he read about slavery, it is more plausible that he would start a club to educate himself and others about the history of slavery in America. It shows that he is interested in learning more and wants to take action to raise awareness about the issue. If he was pleased every time he read about it, he may not feel the need to start a club or take any action."}}
{"Q": "Kelley wished she could draw a beautiful horse for her mother. Which event could cause Kelly now has a beautiful horse picture to give to her mother?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelley worked really hard to practice her ballet. (B) Kelley drew a horse fro her mom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Kelley drew a horse for her mom, as this directly addresses her wish to give her mother a beautiful horse picture. Practicing ballet may improve Kelley's skills in that area, but it does not directly relate to her desire to draw a horse for her mother."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to make some wine. Which event could cause Alas, it tasted poor?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I looked up the recipe but decided not to make it. (B) I made some from a recipe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I made some from a recipe.\nExplanation: Making wine involves a complex process that requires precise measurements and timing. If any step is not followed correctly, it can result in poor-tasting wine. Therefore, making wine from a recipe and not following the instructions correctly can cause the wine to taste poor. On the other hand, if someone decides not to make the wine after looking up the recipe, it would not affect the taste of the wine as it was not made."}}
{"Q": "Devin was swimming in the ocean. Which event could cause He had his friend urinate on him to fix it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Devin was stung by a jellyfish. (B) Devin got a barnacle from the water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Devin was stung by a jellyfish.\nExplanation: When stung by a jellyfish, the tentacles release venom that can cause a burning sensation and pain. One common remedy is to have someone urinate on the affected area, as the ammonia in urine can neutralize the venom. While it may seem unusual, this is a well-known and often recommended treatment for jellyfish stings. On the other hand, getting a barnacle from the water would not require such a remedy."}}
{"Q": "I get to go to the mall today. Which event could cause My shopping trip was a success?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I had plenty of back to school clothes. (B) I need some back to school clothes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If the person had plenty of back to school clothes after their shopping trip, it would indicate that they were able to find what they needed and were satisfied with their purchases, making their shopping trip a success. Option B suggests that the person still needs to find clothes, which would not necessarily make the shopping trip a success."}}
{"Q": "Kelly really needed some new headphones. Which event could cause They were great?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly purchased some from the zoo. (B) Kelly spent all day researching quite ones to buy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Kelly purchased some from the zoo.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kelly would be able to try out and purchase headphones from a store or vendor, such as one at the zoo, rather than spending all day researching and potentially buying a pair online without being able to test them out first. If Kelly found a pair of headphones that met her needs and expectations at the zoo, it would make sense for her to say \"They were great.\""}}
{"Q": "Becca was an awesome singer. Which event could cause Becca's mom cried at her daughter's amazing display?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Becca was too scared to sing in public. (B) Becca performed a duet with her classmate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Becca was too scared to sing in public.\nExplanation: Becca's mom could have cried tears of joy and pride if her daughter overcame her fear of singing in public and gave an amazing performance. It would be a touching moment for a parent to see their child conquer their fears and showcase their talent. On the other hand, performing a duet with a classmate may not necessarily evoke tears from Becca's mom, as it is a common occurrence in music performances."}}
{"Q": "Tim had no free time for himself because of his long hours at work. Which event could cause He returned to work rejuvenated and well rested?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided to take a few days off for a work conference. (B) Tim decided that he needed a vacation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: If Tim decided to take a few days off for a work conference, it is possible that he could have used that time to relax and recharge. Conferences often have breaks and downtime where attendees can explore the area or simply rest. Additionally, attending a conference could provide Tim with new ideas and inspiration, which could help him feel more motivated and energized when he returns to work. On the other hand, if Tim simply took a vacation, there is no guarantee that he would use that time to rest and rejuvenate. He could end up filling his schedule with activities and sightseeing, which could leave him feeling just as exhausted as before."}}
{"Q": "Carla smelt something burning in the next room. Which event could cause The roommate checked her mini oven, crumbs were burning on her tray?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Carla asked the roommate if she wanted dinner. (B) Carla went to the room.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Carla went to the room.\nExplanation: If Carla smelt something burning in the next room, it is more likely that she would go to the room to investigate the source of the smell. Option (A) does not seem plausible as asking the roommate if she wanted dinner would not necessarily lead to the discovery of the burning crumbs."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy's parents got a new dishwasher. Which event could cause Finally them made it into a space ship?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jimmy's parents donated the old dishwasher to charity. (B) His parents decided to make the dishwasher box into a toy for Jimmy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His parents decided to make the dishwasher box into a toy for Jimmy.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jimmy's parents would repurpose the dishwasher box into a toy for their child rather than suddenly turning it into a spaceship. Donating the old dishwasher to charity would not have any direct connection to Jimmy's parents turning the box into a toy or spaceship."}}
{"Q": "Kendrick uses his fireplace often. Which event could cause Kendrick now really appreciates his fireplace?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kendrick cleaned up his fireplace. (B) In the summer Kendrick used it to cool his home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kendrick cleaned up his fireplace.\nExplanation: If Kendrick cleaned up his fireplace, he may have discovered that it was not functioning properly or efficiently before. After cleaning it, he may have noticed a significant improvement in its performance, which would make him appreciate it more. Additionally, a clean fireplace is safer to use and can reduce the risk of a fire hazard, which would also make Kendrick appreciate it more. On the other hand, using a fireplace to cool a home in the summer (option B) is not a practical or logical use of a fireplace, as it is designed to produce heat. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sammy wanted to surprise his girlfriend. Which event could cause It meant he remembered her talking about how much she liked them?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sammy, brought his girlfriend socks. (B) Sammy got his girlfriend she always talked about.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Sammy got his girlfriend something she always talked about.\nExplanation: If Sammy remembered his girlfriend talking about something she liked, it would make sense for him to get her that item as a surprise. Socks, on the other hand, may not be as meaningful or special unless there was a specific reason or inside joke behind them."}}
{"Q": "Dan was about to travel to meet his parents this weekend. Which event could cause Dan was upset that he could not find his passport anywhere?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan did not know where his suitcase was. (B) Dan needed a passport to travel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Dan needed a passport to travel.\nExplanation: If Dan needed to travel, he would need his passport to cross international borders. Without it, he would not be able to travel and would have to cancel his plans to meet his parents. This would be a valid reason for him to be upset and worried about not being able to find his passport. The fact that he did not know where his suitcase was may also cause some inconvenience, but it would not be as critical as not having his passport."}}
{"Q": "I went to a piano concert and fell in love with the instrument. Which event could cause I finally had my own piano concert after all that work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I decided to take piano lessons after the concert. (B) I started taking lessons and practiced sometimes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If the person decided to take piano lessons after the concert, it would be more likely that they would work towards having their own piano concert. Taking lessons would provide the necessary skills and practice to eventually perform in front of an audience. Simply starting lessons and practicing sometimes may not be enough to lead to a full concert performance."}}
{"Q": "Amy and her family were going to Mount Rushmore. Which event could cause Although she was annoyed by the drive she was impressed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She decided to take the longer route because it was more scenic. (B) Amy's parents were annoying.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) She decided to take the longer route because it was more scenic.\nExplanation: If Amy decided to take the longer route, it means that she was interested in seeing the scenery. Therefore, it is more plausible that she would be impressed by the drive despite being annoyed by it. On the other hand, if her parents were annoying, it would not necessarily lead to her being impressed by the drive."}}
{"Q": "Rita loved being outdoors. Which event could cause She now goes hiking nearly every weekend, rain or shine?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rita got a new pair of all weather boots. (B) She learned to fish in the mountains.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rita got a new pair of all weather boots.\nExplanation: Getting a new pair of all weather boots would make it easier for Rita to hike in any weather condition, which could motivate her to go hiking more often. Learning to fish in the mountains may also be enjoyable for Rita, but it does not necessarily explain why she would start going hiking nearly every weekend."}}
{"Q": "Mike was sitting at his desk. Which event could cause Mike started laughing hysterically?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mikes coworker told him a joke. (B) Mike's friend told him his mother passed away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Mike's coworker told him a joke.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mike would start laughing hysterically if his coworker told him a joke, as laughter is a common response to humor. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Mike would start laughing hysterically if his friend told him his mother passed away, as this is a sad and serious event."}}
{"Q": "Today was the first day of school. Which event could cause I had a great time at school?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I made a lot of new cars. (B) I met some really cool new friends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I met some really cool new friends.\nExplanation: Making new friends is a common and enjoyable experience for many students on the first day of school. It can lead to a sense of belonging and excitement about the school year ahead. While making new cars could also be fun, it is less likely to be a significant factor in determining whether someone had a great time at school."}}
{"Q": "Tom argued with Ana throughout the night since a random guy called her Which event could cause He told Anna to get out?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was upset that Ana might be cheating on him. (B) Ana told Tom she was having a family reunion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom was upset that Ana might be cheating on him.\nExplanation: Tom's reaction of arguing with Ana throughout the night and telling her to get out suggests that he was feeling betrayed and hurt by the random guy calling her. This kind of reaction is more likely to be caused by suspicions of infidelity rather than Ana simply attending a family reunion. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kay was in art class when it was announced they would be painting. Which event could cause Then she saw the neighbors painting, and was embarrassed by her work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kay thought her painting looked great. (B) Kay was painting a dog, and thought she was doing a really terrible job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kay was painting a dog, and thought she was doing a really terrible job.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it sets up a scenario where Kay is already feeling insecure about her painting skills. Seeing her neighbors painting and potentially comparing her work to theirs could make her feel even more self-conscious and embarrassed about her own painting. Additionally, the fact that she is painting a specific subject (a dog) suggests that she may have a particular image in her mind of what the painting should look like, which could add to her feelings of inadequacy if she feels like she is not achieving that vision."}}
{"Q": "Bart is five and he loves trucks. Which event could cause This mythic item is the amazing dump truck that he plays with?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bart calls his favorite truck the mythic item. (B) Bart thinks his toy ball is mythic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: Bart's love for trucks is established in the question, so it is more plausible that he would consider his favorite truck as a mythic item rather than his toy ball. Additionally, the use of the word \"amazing\" to describe the dump truck suggests that it holds a special place in Bart's heart, further supporting the idea that he would consider it a mythic item."}}
{"Q": "It was Martha's last day of school. Which event could cause He signed it and he even wrote down his phone number?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Martha asked her friend to sign her yearbook. (B) A guy she liked asked her to sign his yearbook.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Martha asked her friend to sign her yearbook.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Martha would ask her friend to sign her yearbook on her last day of school, rather than a guy she liked asking her to sign his yearbook. Additionally, it makes sense for her friend to write down their phone number as a way to stay in touch over the summer."}}
{"Q": "A man drove while listening to the radio. Which event could cause The man called the radio station to ask?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The man heard a song he liked but the radio station mentioned the name of what the song was. (B) He wanted to know the name of a song.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He wanted to know the name of a song.\nExplanation: If the man heard a song he liked but the radio station mentioned the name of the song, he could simply wait for the radio station to mention the name again or look it up online. However, if he wanted to know the name of a song that was playing, he would need to call the radio station to ask. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I was invited to go to a family reunion by my mother. Which event could cause It turned out that I used the wrong address, and had to turn around?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When I got there, I was surprised that I didn't know anyone there. (B) Ideas nextbdoor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. When I got there, I was surprised that I didn't know anyone there.\nExplanation: If the wrong address was used, it is possible that the person ended up at a different location where they didn't know anyone. This would be a plausible event that could cause surprise and confusion. On the other hand, ideas next door is not a likely event that would result from using the wrong address for a family reunion."}}
{"Q": "Rachel had to go to the dentist today. Which event could cause Before she knew it was time to go home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Thankfully, the appointment was fast and painless. (B) The appointment was long and painful.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Thankfully, the appointment was fast and painless.\nExplanation: If Rachel's appointment was fast and painless, it is more likely that she would not have realized how much time had passed and would be surprised that it was already time to go home. On the other hand, if the appointment was long and painful, she would have been more aware of the time passing and would not be as surprised when it was time to leave."}}
{"Q": "I entered an egg race once. Which event could cause I finished third in the race?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I did my best to cook the egg. (B) I did not win it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I did not win it.\nExplanation: In an egg race, the objective is to complete the race while carrying an egg on a spoon without dropping or breaking it. Therefore, the most plausible reason for finishing third in the race is that other participants completed the race faster than you did, resulting in you not winning the race. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as cooking the egg is not a requirement for the race."}}
{"Q": "Amy was going to a party. Which event could cause Amy was horrified when she looked in a mirror to see her makeup melte?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was hot outside the party. (B) Amy was dancing and it was warm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was hot outside the party.\nExplanation: Heat can cause makeup to melt, especially if it is hot and humid outside. Dancing and warmth may also contribute to makeup melting, but the heat outside the party is a more plausible explanation as it can affect makeup even before Amy enters the party."}}
{"Q": "A monkey watched a crowd of children walk past his cage. Which event could cause The kid threw some of his food over the fence to feed the monkey?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The monkey screeched loudly and scared the kids away. (B) The money screeched loudly and pointed to his tummy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the monkey would screech and point to his tummy in response to being fed by a child, as this is a common behavior for animals in captivity who are used to being fed by humans. Scaring the kids away would not benefit the monkey in any way, and it is unlikely that the monkey would screech loudly without any apparent reason."}}
{"Q": "My friend went to get a straightening treatment done yesterday. Which event could cause She decided to lay off the treatments?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My friend's hair became dry and brittle. (B) My friend loved the procedure.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If my friend's hair became dry and brittle after the straightening treatment, it is a common side effect of chemical treatments. This could cause her to decide to lay off the treatments to avoid further damage to her hair. On the other hand, if she loved the procedure, it is unlikely that she would decide to stop getting it done."}}
{"Q": "Roy was at a staff meeting that was soon to close. Which event could cause The whole office, including the boss heard the secret?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a rumor that Roy was absent that day. (B) someone on the other end of the conference call forgot to push the mute button and false about plans for job cuts.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If someone on the other end of the conference call forgot to push the mute button and discussed plans for job cuts, it is possible that the whole office, including the boss, could hear the secret. This is a more plausible answer than A, which does not provide a clear explanation of how the secret could be heard by everyone in the office."}}
{"Q": "Who doesn't love pizza? Which event could cause The kitten and Sam are now best friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam was walking home with a pizza pie when he found a kitten and shared some cheese with it. (B) Sam was eating all alone at a party one day when he noticed a stray kitten to share his pizza with.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sam and the kitten became friends because Sam shared his pizza with the kitten while walking home. It is less likely that Sam would be eating alone at a party and notice a stray kitten to share his pizza with. Additionally, sharing food is a common way for animals and humans to bond, so it makes sense that sharing cheese from a pizza pie would lead to a friendship between Sam and the kitten."}}
{"Q": "Jeff needed money to buy a car. Which event could cause His mom was happy with his work ethic so she helped pay for the rest?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jeff managed to spend a lot of time. (B) Jeff got two jobs so he could get the money for a car.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jeff got two jobs so he could get the money for a car.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jeff's mom would be happy with his work ethic if he took on two jobs to earn the money for a car, rather than just spending a lot of time without any clear goal or effort. By working hard and showing determination, Jeff demonstrated responsibility and initiative, which likely impressed his mom and led her to offer financial assistance."}}
{"Q": "Billy wanted to walk with his dog in the pet parade. Which event could cause But Billy's dog turned and headed him in the opposite direction?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wanted his dog to go sing a song. (B) Bill hoped his rambunctious pup would follow the other dogs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Bill hoped his rambunctious pup would follow the other dogs.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Billy's dog got distracted by the other dogs in the parade and wanted to follow them, rather than him wanting his dog to sing a song, which is unlikely."}}
{"Q": "Jane was out for a walk. Which event could cause She took a hot shower and dried her clothes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Suddenly it began to snow. (B) Suddenly it began to warm up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Suddenly it began to warm up.\n\nExplanation: If it suddenly began to warm up, Jane may have felt hot and sweaty from her walk and decided to take a hot shower to cool down. She may have also washed and dried her clothes if they were damp from sweating. On the other hand, if it suddenly began to snow, Jane would likely have sought shelter and warmth instead of taking a hot shower. Therefore, (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I bought a used computer. Which event could cause I realized whoever used to own the computer was very creative?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There were a lot of old poems in the documents folder. (B) When I explored the files on it, I found lots of blank pages.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Finding old poems in the documents folder suggests that the previous owner had a creative side and enjoyed writing. Blank pages could be a result of various reasons, such as incomplete work or accidental deletion, and do not necessarily indicate creativity. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Willie walked his neighbor's dog often Which event could cause Willie bo longer walks the dog?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Willie got beat up by the neighbors dog one day. (B) Willie's neighbor then got better and was able to walk the dog.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Willie's neighbor then got better and was able to walk the dog.\n\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is a positive event that would allow Willie to stop walking the dog. If Willie got beat up by the neighbor's dog, it would be unlikely that he would continue to walk the dog. However, if the neighbor got better and was able to walk the dog, it would make sense for Willie to stop walking the dog."}}
{"Q": "Ivan put five hundred dollars into the stock market. Which event could cause Ivan lost all of his money?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ivan's stock went up a lot. (B) Ivan didn't understand how stocks work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ivan didn't understand how stocks work.\nExplanation: If Ivan didn't understand how stocks work, he may make poor investment decisions, such as investing in high-risk stocks or not diversifying his portfolio. This could lead to him losing all of his money. On the other hand, if Ivan's stock went up a lot, he could potentially make a profit, but it wouldn't cause him to lose all of his money."}}
{"Q": "Larry never had seen snow in his entire life. Which event could cause He will never leave Florida again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Larry had to shovel five centimeters of snow off the porch. (B) He traveled to Vermont on vacation and was trapped for days by a record snowfall.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Larry would be deterred from leaving Florida again if he experienced a severe snowstorm that caused him to be trapped for days. Shoveling five centimeters of snow off the porch may be a new experience for him, but it is unlikely to be a significant enough event to make him never want to leave Florida again."}}
{"Q": "There was a power outage in the neighborhood due to the thunderstorm. Which event could cause They also participated in several activities such as cooking?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Everyone had to do things together. (B) The towns community center canceled their meeting.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neither event is directly related to the other. \nExplanation: The power outage and thunderstorm would not necessarily cause everyone to do things together or result in the cancellation of a community center meeting. The activities such as cooking mentioned in the question are not related to the power outage or thunderstorm either. Therefore, there is no plausible answer from the given choices."}}
{"Q": "Yesterday, I needed to buy a belt so I went to the mall. Which event could cause I picked out a great belt and left feeling excellent?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Then is aw a selection of nice belts. (B) There is a selection of fruit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Seeing a selection of nice belts would be more likely to lead to picking out a great belt and feeling excellent, as it directly relates to the task at hand. Seeing a selection of fruit would not have any impact on the outcome of finding a good belt."}}
{"Q": "Zach's family were spending thanksgiving together. Which event could cause The rest of his family cleaned the house and had breakfast together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Zach had to leave for work the next day. (B) Zach cooked the turkey.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Zach cooked the turkey.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the rest of the family cleaned the house and had breakfast together while Zach was busy cooking the turkey, which is a time-consuming task. It is less likely that the entire family would clean the house and have breakfast together just because Zach had to leave for work the next day."}}
{"Q": "Lucy and Rick bought a house for a good price. Which event could cause Then they sold the beautifully renovated house for a huge profit?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They renovated the house and flipped it. (B) The house burnt down the day after they bought it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They renovated the house and flipped it.\n\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it states that Lucy and Rick renovated the house and then sold it for a profit. This is a common practice in the real estate industry known as \"flipping.\" Option B, on the other hand, suggests that the house burnt down, which is an unlikely event that would not result in a profit. Therefore, option A is the more logical explanation for how Lucy and Rick made a profit from the house."}}
{"Q": "Laura had a passion for art. Which event could cause Laura never painted again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Laura was successful with her drawings. (B) Laura's art teacher was a mean person.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Laura's art teacher was a mean person.\n\nExplanation: If Laura's art teacher was a mean person, it could have caused her to lose her passion for art. A teacher's negative attitude and criticism can be demotivating and discouraging for a student. It could have made Laura feel like she was not good enough or that her art was not worth pursuing. This could have led to her giving up on painting altogether. On the other hand, if Laura was successful with her drawings, it would have likely encouraged her to continue pursuing her passion for art."}}
{"Q": "The monster banged on the wall. Which event could cause With a final loud thump, her father hung the wall clock?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It stopped banging and when she turned to look, it was her father silently hanging something. (B) The monster's father told her to stop doing that.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It stopped banging and when she turned to look, it was her father silently hanging something.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it provides a logical sequence of events. The monster was banging on the wall, but then it stopped. When the protagonist turned to look, she saw her father hanging something on the wall. This suggests that the loud thump was caused by her father hanging the wall clock, which is a reasonable explanation. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear connection between the monster banging on the wall and the father hanging the clock."}}
{"Q": "Connie loves making crafts for the holidays. Which event could cause She is much more cautious while using the scissors now?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) While making a paper snowman, she cut herself with scissors and had to be rushed to the hospital. (B) Connie was busy cutting fabric. Connie didn't notice she cut right through all the fabric.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Connie would become more cautious with scissors after cutting herself and having to be rushed to the hospital. This experience would likely make her more aware of the potential dangers of using scissors and encourage her to be more careful in the future. Cutting through fabric, while frustrating, is not likely to cause such a significant change in behavior."}}
{"Q": "I had a date to play chess online with my friend Mick. Which event could cause We never got to play?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) we ended up talking all night. (B) I ended up vomiting all night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the two friends ended up talking all night and forgot about their chess game, rather than one of them getting sick and unable to play. Additionally, vomiting all night would likely result in canceling plans altogether, rather than just postponing a game of chess."}}
{"Q": "My friend has two cats, and they're not very alike. Which event could cause Over time, even mean cats can warm up to people?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mean cat started to attack humans for no reason. (B) Recently, one that always hissed at me came near me.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the mean cat started to warm up to people gradually, as evidenced by the fact that it came near the person who it previously hissed at. It is unlikely that the cat would suddenly start attacking humans for no reason, as this would be a significant change in behavior. Gradual changes in behavior are more common and likely to occur over time."}}
{"Q": "I've never wanted kids. Which event could cause After watching her, it changed my outlook on wanting kids?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) But the condom broke. (B) My sister recently had a child, and she was close to the child in the months following her birth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) My sister recently had a child, and she was close to the child in the months following her birth.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that spending time with a newborn baby, especially if it is a close family member's child, could change someone's outlook on wanting kids. The experience of seeing the child grow and develop, and the bond that forms between the child and the person, could make them reconsider their previous stance on having children. On the other hand, a condom breaking is not a reliable or ethical way to change someone's mind about having kids."}}
{"Q": "Sally's two dogs love to ride in in her car. Which event could cause Once the errands were done, the dogs were not happy to go back home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sally took the dogs with her when she had to run errands. (B) Sally took her drugs on errands.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sally took the dogs with her when she had to run errands.\nExplanation: Since the dogs love to ride in Sally's car, they would be happy to go with her on errands. However, once the errands were done, they would not be happy to go back home as they would have enjoyed the car ride and being with Sally. Option B, which suggests that Sally took drugs on errands, is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the behavior of the dogs."}}
{"Q": "Skip liked to eat candy. Which event could cause He didn't eat candy for a week?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Skip ate apples and threw up. (B) Skip got a toothache.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Skip got a toothache.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Skip didn't eat candy for a week because he got a toothache. Toothaches can make it difficult and painful to eat sugary foods like candy. On the other hand, while eating too many apples could potentially cause Skip to feel sick, it is less likely to result in him avoiding candy for a week."}}
{"Q": "Ruth was playing video games. Which event could cause She won the game easily?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ruth started playing a new game. (B) Ruth challenged her friend to a game of golf.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ruth started playing a new game.\nExplanation: If Ruth started playing a new game, it is possible that the game is easier than the ones she has played before, or she may have more experience with that type of game. This could lead to her winning the game easily. On the other hand, playing golf with a friend has nothing to do with video games, so it is unlikely to have any impact on Ruth's ability to win a video game."}}
{"Q": "The radio DJ got into a big country music binge. Which event could cause The crowd had none of it and stormed the station?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The DJ wouldn't play any other type of music that was requested. (B) The audience wanted the DJ to return to his home country.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The DJ wouldn't play any other type of music that was requested.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the audience would get upset if the DJ refused to play any other type of music besides country, especially if they were requesting different genres. This could lead to frustration and anger among the listeners, causing them to storm the station. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the audience would demand the DJ to return to his home country solely based on his music preference."}}
{"Q": "I've always wanted to be able to bike thirty miles at one time. Which event could cause Now I can bike 30 miles?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I rode a little further every day. (B) I decided to run instead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the goal is to be able to bike thirty miles at one time, then the most plausible event that could cause achieving this goal is gradually increasing the distance biked each day. This is because consistent practice and gradual progression is the most effective way to build endurance and stamina for longer distances. Switching to running instead would not necessarily lead to being able to bike thirty miles, as it is a different form of exercise that works different muscles and requires different training."}}
{"Q": "The principal of Brandon's school was retiring this year. Which event could cause Everyone clapped for the new guy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At a school assembly the new principal was introduced. (B) The school held an assembly to usher out the new principal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. At a school assembly the new principal was introduced.\nExplanation: It is common for people to clap and show appreciation when someone new is introduced, especially in a professional setting like a school assembly. In this case, the new principal would be the focus of the assembly and it would be appropriate for everyone to show their support and excitement for the new leadership. On the other hand, it would be unlikely for people to clap for someone who is leaving or being ushered out, as it is a more somber occasion. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mike has been looking for extra sources of income this summer. Which event could cause He decided to look for other sources of income?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike mowed lawns but did not make very little money at it. (B) Mike did not want to be a fisherman.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mike mowed lawns but did not make very little money at it.\n\nExplanation: If Mike did not make much money from mowing lawns, it is likely that he would look for other sources of income. This event would be a plausible reason for him to start searching for other ways to make money. On the other hand, the fact that Mike did not want to be a fisherman does not necessarily mean that he would actively seek out other sources of income."}}
{"Q": "Ron started his new job as a landscaper today. Which event could cause His boss commends him for a job well done?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ron followed specifications and took extra gum to get the job done. (B) Ron followed specifications and took extra miles to get job done.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Ron's boss would commend him for a job well done if he followed the specifications and took extra effort to get the job done. Option A states that Ron took extra gum, which is most likely a typo and should be interpreted as \"took extra time\" or \"took extra care\" to complete the job. This shows that Ron is dedicated and willing to go the extra mile to ensure the job is done correctly, which would impress his boss and earn him praise. Option B, on the other hand, states that Ron took extra miles, which is unclear and does not make sense in the context of landscaping. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sam and Ellie met at adult education classes. Which event could cause And soon they were reading each other books on their dates?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They both liked movies and hit it off immediately. (B) Sam and Ellie both liked to read books.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sam and Ellie both liked to read books.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the activity they started doing together. If they both enjoyed reading books, it makes sense that they would share their favorite books with each other on their dates. Choice (A) about liking movies doesn't necessarily lead to the activity of reading books together."}}
{"Q": "Tracy's cat was named Bob. Which event could cause Bob still has fleas?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tracy used an expensive vet treatment on her cat. (B) Tracy would never give her cat, Bob a bath.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tracy would never give her cat, Bob a bath.\nExplanation: If Tracy never gives her cat, Bob a bath, then he may still have fleas. Fleas can be difficult to get rid of and require regular grooming and treatment. If Bob is not being bathed or groomed regularly, the fleas may continue to thrive on him. Using an expensive vet treatment may help to eliminate the fleas, but if Bob is not being properly cared for, he may become re-infested."}}
{"Q": "Luca was baptized in the Catholic church. Which event could cause Luca flew to Syria to join Isis?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Luca began talking to an Irish man on the internet and fell in love with him. (B) Luca hated the Church.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Luca's hatred towards the Catholic Church could lead him to join a radical group like ISIS, rather than falling in love with someone on the internet. Religious extremism and radicalization often stem from a deep-seated anger or resentment towards a particular group or ideology. Luca's baptism in the Catholic Church may have also played a role in his radicalization, as he may have felt a sense of betrayal or disillusionment with the Church's teachings."}}
{"Q": "Ray's teacher told the class to be quiet as she passed out tests. Which event could cause Ray felt helpless?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ray scanned the test and didn't know the answers. (B) Ray's teacher had to go to the bathroom but was afraid to ask.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Ray feeling helpless would most likely be caused by not knowing the answers on the test, as this is a situation where he may feel like he has no control over the outcome. The teacher needing to go to the bathroom may cause some discomfort or inconvenience, but it is unlikely to make Ray feel helpless."}}
{"Q": "I've set a goal to lose thirty pounds by the end of June. Which event could cause When I finished, I was exhausted but I felt wonderful?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) During the first day I worked out for three hours straight in order to jump start my diet. (B) I finished a rigorous workout program.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Finishing a rigorous workout program is a more plausible event that could cause the feeling of exhaustion but also a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Working out for three hours straight on the first day may lead to burnout or injury, which could hinder progress towards the weight loss goal. A rigorous workout program, on the other hand, is designed to gradually increase in intensity and duration, allowing the body to adapt and improve over time. This approach is more sustainable and effective for achieving long-term weight loss goals."}}
{"Q": "Megan had recently put up her Christmas tree. Which event could cause Unfortunately it was too tall combined with the tree and wouldn't fit?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Megan tried to put the tree topper on the floor next to her tree. (B) Megan placed the star at tree top.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Megan placed the star at tree top.\nExplanation: If Megan placed the star at the top of the tree and it was too tall, then it wouldn't fit in the room. This is a more plausible answer because the tree topper being on the floor next to the tree wouldn't affect the height of the tree."}}
{"Q": "Maggie noticed a bat was flying around her ceiling. Which event could cause Maggie's cat was dead?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Maggie wondered why her cat did not catch the bat. (B) The cat scratched and killed the bat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The cat scratched and killed the bat.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cat's death was caused by an event related to its interaction with the bat, rather than Maggie simply wondering why her cat did not catch the bat. Therefore, option (B) is more likely, as the cat may have been injured or contracted a disease from the bat, leading to its death."}}
{"Q": "As a child I often went too my grandma's house. Which event could cause Her home is now a place I take my children?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She always treated me poorly and I hated going to her house. (B) She always treated me kindly and I loved going to her house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If the grandmother always treated the person kindly and they loved going to her house as a child, it is likely that they have positive memories and associations with the home. This would make it a natural choice for them to bring their own children to visit and create new memories. If the grandmother had treated the person poorly, it is unlikely that they would want to continue visiting her home or bring their own children there."}}
{"Q": "Phineas and his son were stuck in the ditch. Which event could cause After an hour someone came by and helped them get out?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Phineas and his son thought no one would come. (B) Phineas and his son had passed away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Phineas and his son thought no one would come.\n\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is possible for someone to come and help them out of the ditch, especially if they were on a well-traveled road. It is unlikely that they would both pass away in the short time they were stuck in the ditch. However, it is possible that they may have thought no one would come and were relieved when someone finally did."}}
{"Q": "Sammy always claimed to make the perfect pancake. Which event could cause He was the clear winner?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He judged a pancake making contest. (B) Sammy entered into a competition after working hours on it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He judged a pancake making contest.\nExplanation: If Sammy judged a pancake making contest, it would give him the opportunity to taste and evaluate other people's pancakes. If his pancake truly was the best, he would be able to recognize it and declare himself the winner. This scenario is more plausible than Sammy entering into a competition after working hours on it, as there is no guarantee that he would win in a competition with other skilled pancake makers."}}
{"Q": "Julie bought a cat today. Which event could cause Julie is excited to have Lily in her life?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) SHE ABANDONED IT. (B) The cat cuddled with Julie.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The cat cuddled with Julie.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Julie would be excited to have Lily in her life if the cat cuddled with her. This would indicate that the cat is friendly and affectionate, which would make Julie feel happy and loved. On the other hand, if Julie had abandoned the cat, it is unlikely that she would be excited about it, as this would suggest that she did not want the cat in the first place."}}
{"Q": "Victor idolized mike tyson. Which event could cause He got a lot of attention and fame?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He met Mike Tyson one day at the mall. His friends knew that he had met him. (B) Mike Tyson is a former soccer player.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Meeting Mike Tyson, who is a famous boxer, would be a significant event for someone who idolizes him. The fact that Victor's friends knew about it would also add to the attention and fame he received. On the other hand, Mike Tyson being a former soccer player is not a plausible event as he is known for his career in boxing."}}
{"Q": "Janice and Alma were two friends who went out to eat one day. Which event could cause Eventually, the guy went and sat with them and they all ate together?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Alma noticed a guy looking at Janice. (B) They wanted to eat alone, so Janice and Alma pretended they didn't see their other friend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Alma noticed a guy looking at Janice.\n\nExplanation: This event could lead to the guy joining them because Alma may have pointed out the guy's interest in Janice to her, which could have led to a conversation between the three of them. On the other hand, choice B doesn't seem to have any connection to the guy joining them to eat."}}
{"Q": "We went to the mall to buy christmas presents. Which event could cause We just let them have it and tried to find a new spot at the mall?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We tried to park in a space someone was waiting for. (B) There was 1 toy left and another person hated it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We tried to park in a space someone was waiting for.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because parking at the mall during the holiday season can be very competitive and stressful. It is not uncommon for people to become frustrated and territorial over parking spots. If the group tried to park in a space that someone else was waiting for, it could have caused a confrontation or argument, leading them to give up the spot and find a new one. On the other hand, the scenario in option B seems less likely to cause such a reaction. While people may get upset over a popular toy, it is unlikely that it would lead to the group giving up and leaving the mall altogether."}}
{"Q": "My girlfriend and I messed up the bed pretty bad. Which event could cause We finished by placing the pillows decoratively?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We decided to make the bed and straighten the blankets. (B) We decided to clean the bed after work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We decided to make the bed and straighten the blankets.\nExplanation: It is more likely that after messing up the bed, the couple would decide to make the bed and straighten the blankets to make it look presentable again. Cleaning the bed after work may involve vacuuming or wiping down the bed frame, but it wouldn't necessarily involve placing the pillows decoratively."}}
{"Q": "Gina's mom was going to her younger brothers house. Which event could cause If her siblings were going to have fun, so was she?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The kids loved playing with Ginas mom. (B) Gina wanted to go to her brother's house too.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gina would want to go to her brother's house to have fun with her siblings rather than the kids loving to play with her mom. It is natural for siblings to want to spend time together and have fun, so it makes sense that Gina would want to join in on the fun."}}
{"Q": "A man was having a panic attack. Which event could cause He never had a panic attack again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A fairy came down and stopped the mans panic attack. (B) He decided to go see a doctor and get therapy for his anxiety but it failed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Seeking professional help and getting therapy for anxiety is a common and effective way to manage panic attacks. While it may not work for everyone, it is a more plausible solution than a fairy magically stopping the panic attack."}}
{"Q": "Danny loved baking doughnuts for his friends and family. Which event could cause Danny's shop became one of the most popular places in town?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He opened up a aquarium shop. (B) Danny decided to open up his own doughnut shop.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Danny decided to open up his own doughnut shop.\nExplanation: If Danny opened up his own doughnut shop, he would be able to share his love for baking with a wider audience. If his doughnuts were delicious and unique, word of mouth would spread and his shop would become popular. On the other hand, opening up an aquarium shop would not necessarily have the same effect on his doughnut baking skills and would not be as relevant to his passion."}}
{"Q": "Jenny was a photographer. Which event could cause After they were done, the couple promised to leave a positive review?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jenny forgot her camera to take photographs. (B) She took photos for free of a poor couple.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She took photos for free of a poor couple.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the couple promised to leave a positive review after Jenny took photos for free of a poor couple. This act of kindness and generosity would likely leave a positive impression on the couple, leading them to want to leave a positive review as a way of showing their gratitude. Forgetting her camera would not be a positive experience for the couple and would not necessarily lead to a positive review."}}
{"Q": "Kayla wanted to look her best for her date. Which event could cause Her date complimented her and said she looked great?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kayla went to the hair salon and got a new hairdo and her makeup done. (B) Kayla took libterties with her clothes and makeup.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Going to the hair salon and getting a new hairdo and makeup done is a more plausible answer as it shows that Kayla put effort into her appearance and made a noticeable change. Taking liberties with clothes and makeup could mean anything and may not necessarily result in a compliment from her date."}}
{"Q": "Marty loved taking pictures. Which event could cause Marty's photoset was featured in the newspaper?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Marty lost his camera one day. (B) He shot and printed a thoughtful series on the progress of the seasons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He shot and printed a thoughtful series on the progress of the seasons.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it shows that Marty has a talent for photography and has put effort into creating a series of photos that are worth featuring in the newspaper. Losing his camera (option A) does not necessarily showcase his photography skills, and it is unlikely that the newspaper would feature a random set of photos without any context or story behind them. On the other hand, a series of photos that capture the beauty and changes of the seasons could be a compelling story for the newspaper to feature."}}
{"Q": "Gina was at the grocery store near her home. Which event could cause Gina let out a big sigh, knowing this was going to be a long wait?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina was the only person in line. (B) Gina went during peak time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Gina went during peak time.\nExplanation: If Gina went during peak time, there would likely be a lot of people in the store and in line, causing a long wait. This is a common experience for many people who go grocery shopping during busy times. On the other hand, if Gina was the only person in line, she would likely not need to let out a big sigh, as there would be no wait at all."}}
{"Q": "Francis noticed that he had a toothache. Which event could cause He was happy when the dentist fixed his toothache?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Francis made an appointment and went to the doctor to get the tooth looked at. (B) Francis lost a tooth at the dentist's.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Francis made an appointment and went to the doctor to get the tooth looked at.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Francis went to the dentist to get his toothache fixed rather than losing a tooth at the dentist's. Therefore, option A is the more likely event that caused Francis to be happy when the dentist fixed his toothache."}}
{"Q": "Garry was nervous about his grades. Which event could cause Garry and his coach agreed that Nike makes good sneakers?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Garry's coach rewarded him for his good grades with new shoes. (B) Despite his misgivings Garry became valedictorian & Adidas picked him up as a sponsor providing years of footwear.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Garry's nervousness about his grades suggests that he is currently a student, and therefore it is more plausible that his coach would reward him for good grades with new shoes rather than him becoming a valedictorian and being picked up as a sponsor by Adidas. Additionally, the statement about Nike making good sneakers seems unrelated to Garry's grades or his potential sponsorship by Adidas, making option A the more logical choice."}}
{"Q": "David was having trouble sleeping at night. Which event could cause The next night, he took too many of them, and never woke up again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) David refused to take sleeping pills. (B) He decided he'd take some sleeping pills.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He decided he'd take some sleeping pills.\n\nExplanation: Taking too many sleeping pills can lead to overdose and potentially fatal consequences. If David was having trouble sleeping and decided to take sleeping pills, he may have taken too many in an attempt to get a good night's rest. This scenario is more plausible than David refusing to take sleeping pills, as it suggests that he was actively seeking a solution to his sleep troubles."}}
{"Q": "Betty loved presents. Which event could cause That she should give a little to get a little?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She often gives presents back. (B) She bought shoes for all.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She often gives presents back.\nExplanation: If Betty often gives presents back, it suggests that she values the act of giving and receiving gifts equally. This would make it more likely that she would be willing to give a little in order to receive a little, as she understands the importance of reciprocity in gift-giving. On the other hand, buying shoes for all may indicate that Betty is generous, but it doesn't necessarily suggest that she would be willing to give in order to receive."}}
{"Q": "Dan was making dinner for his family Which event could cause The salad was ready to eat?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) he chopped up a lot of vegetables while cooking. (B) Dan hadn't purchased anything for salad.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Dan chopped up a lot of vegetables while cooking, it is likely that he used some of them to make a salad. Therefore, it is plausible that the salad was ready to eat. On the other hand, if Dan hadn't purchased anything for salad (option B), it is unlikely that the salad would be ready to eat."}}
{"Q": "A scientist discovers that there is a disease beginning to spread. Which event could cause They feel foolish for having done so?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The scientist warns everyone then realizes he was wrong. (B) They accidentally contamined themselves with the spread.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The scientist warns everyone then realizes he was wrong.\nExplanation: In this scenario, the scientist may feel foolish for having warned everyone about the disease if they later realize that their initial findings were incorrect. This could happen if the scientist misinterpreted their data or made a mistake in their analysis. It is important for scientists to carefully review their findings before making any public announcements to avoid spreading misinformation."}}
{"Q": "It was Amy's first day in the first grade. Which event could cause Amy felt like a big kid for the first time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy walked to school with her parents. (B) Amy walked to school with her little sister.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Amy walked to school with her parents.\nExplanation: Walking to school with her parents could make Amy feel like a big kid because it shows that she is capable of going to school independently and taking responsibility for her education. Walking with her little sister may not necessarily make her feel like a big kid as she may still feel responsible for her younger sibling."}}
{"Q": "Sue was excited to plant her first garden. Which event could cause The seed packets no longer marked the rows but lay all over the yard?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She spent hours getting it perfect. (B) Sue left seeds outside in a storm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sue left seeds outside in a storm.\nExplanation: If Sue left the seed packets outside during a storm, the packets could have been blown away or scattered all over the yard, making it difficult to mark the rows and plant the seeds in the right place. This is a more plausible event than spending hours getting it perfect, as it is common for people to make mistakes or encounter unexpected challenges when starting a new activity like gardening."}}
{"Q": "Billy wanted to become a doctor. Which event could cause He never regretted his decision?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Billy studied hard and became a doctor. (B) Billy's father finally became a doctor and worked very hard everyday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Billy studied hard and became a doctor.\nExplanation: This event directly relates to Billy's goal of becoming a doctor. By studying hard and achieving his goal, it is likely that he would not regret his decision to pursue a career in medicine. On the other hand, the event in option B does not necessarily have a direct impact on Billy's own career path and therefore may not be a strong enough reason for him to never regret his decision."}}
{"Q": "Amy decided to move from Wisconsin to Florida. Which event could cause However, she discovered Alaska was a lot of fun?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy did not think Alaska would be and decided not to take a trip there before the move. (B) Amy did not think Alaska would be fun but decided to take a trip there before the move.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Amy did not think Alaska would be fun but decided to take a trip there before the move.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Amy had a change of heart after experiencing Alaska firsthand. It is common for people to have preconceived notions about a place before visiting, but their opinions can change once they actually go there. This scenario also allows for the possibility that Amy still ultimately decided to move to Florida, but had a fun detour in Alaska before doing so."}}
{"Q": "Nell loved to walk in the field behind her house. Which event could cause She turned around to see her house far in the distance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She walked way too far and got lost. (B) She walked way too far and got thirsty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She walked way too far and got lost.\nExplanation: If Nell walked too far and got lost, she may have continued walking in the wrong direction, causing her house to appear far in the distance. On the other hand, if she got thirsty, she may have turned around to head back to her house, making it unlikely for her to see it far in the distance. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Larry was using his wife's laptop Which event could cause Larry confronted her about it and they're filing for divorce?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Larry saw a pop-up ad from her favorite website. (B) While on the laptop, an email popped up from another man, her secret lover.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. While on the laptop, an email popped up from another man, her secret lover.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible as it involves a direct and clear indication of infidelity on the part of Larry's wife. Seeing a pop-up ad from her favorite website would not necessarily lead to a confrontation or divorce, whereas discovering evidence of a secret lover would likely cause significant emotional distress and lead to a breakdown in the marriage."}}
{"Q": "The researcher observed the tiger from behind a bush. Which event could cause The researcher was so excited to experience such a sight?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They find the tiger. (B) The tiger was eating a cub.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They find the tiger.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the researcher would be excited to see a tiger in its natural habitat rather than witnessing a gruesome event such as a tiger eating a cub. Therefore, finding the tiger would be a more likely event to cause excitement."}}
{"Q": "I was really nervous before my first middle school dance. Which event could cause I drove her to iHop for pancakes and shakes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My date wanted to get something to eat before the dance. (B) My date wanted to get something to eat before the dance, but we were late.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for going to iHop for pancakes and shakes was simply because the date wanted to grab a bite to eat before the dance. Option B suggests that they were already running late, which would make it unlikely that they would stop for food."}}
{"Q": "Amy and her friends were watching a movie at Lynn's house. Which event could cause The embarrassed man changed the channel, and left quietly?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The girls quietly turned the TV to some porn not realizing her Father just came home. (B) Amy saw a sex scene in the movie.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it involves the girls accidentally turning the TV to inappropriate content, which would cause the embarrassed man to change the channel and leave quietly. In contrast, option B only involves Amy seeing a sex scene in the movie, which may not necessarily cause the man to react in such a way."}}
{"Q": "My family was on vacation in Italy. Which event could cause Munich looked good in the picture's background?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We also visited Munich and took photos. (B) We also visited Paris and took photos.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We also visited Munich and took photos.\n\nExplanation: If the family visited Munich and took photos, it is likely that one of the photos captured the city in the background. On the other hand, if they visited Paris, it is unlikely that Munich would be visible in the background of any of their photos. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Garry was nervous about his grades. Which event could cause If Garry doesn't improve his grades, he will be off the team?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gary spent all his time playing football & not studying. (B) Garry's coach said his grades were good and he could stay on the team.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Garry spends all his time playing football and not studying, it is likely that his grades will suffer and he may not improve them. This could lead to him being off the team, as his grades are a requirement for being on the team. On the other hand, if Garry's coach said his grades were good and he could stay on the team, then there would be no reason for Garry to be nervous about his grades and the statement about being off the team would not apply. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lisa wanted to see her favorite band's concert. Which event could cause Lisa went to the concert with her friends and had fun?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lisa went online, but tickets were sold out. (B) Lisa also invited her friends to the concert.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lisa also invited her friends to the concert.\nExplanation: If Lisa invited her friends to the concert, it is more likely that she went to the concert with them and had fun. Going to a concert with friends can enhance the experience and make it more enjoyable. Option (A) suggests that Lisa was unable to get tickets, which would prevent her from attending the concert altogether. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Barry loved to scavenge for young saplings in the forest. Which event could cause They bought every last one of Barry's baskets?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Barry made baskets, and sold them at an event. (B) Barry used the saplings to make figurines to sell to people at the weekend market.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Barry loved to scavenge for young saplings in the forest, but it does not mention anything about him using them to make figurines. On the other hand, it is plausible that Barry made baskets from the saplings and sold them at an event, which could have been popular enough for someone to buy every last one of his baskets."}}
{"Q": "Terry was walking through the city park Which event could cause Terry soon studied chess and began playing himself?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terry noticed people playing chess in the part. (B) Terry saw people playing golf and was fascinated by the game.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Terry noticed people playing chess in the park.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Terry became interested in chess after seeing people playing it in the park, rather than being fascinated by golf. Seeing others play a game can spark curiosity and interest in that game, leading Terry to study and play chess himself."}}
{"Q": "Sadie was on a huge hike. Which event could cause Luckily she pushed herself and managed to reach the peak?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sadie almost gave down mid way. (B) Sadie wanted to go to the top.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Sadie almost gave down mid way.\nExplanation: If Sadie almost gave up midway, it means she faced a significant challenge during the hike. However, she pushed herself and managed to reach the peak, which shows her determination and perseverance. On the other hand, option (B) is not a plausible answer as it merely states Sadie's desire to reach the top, which does not explain any obstacle or challenge she faced during the hike."}}
{"Q": "April was not feeling well when she woke up. Which event could cause The medicine worked and she went back to school the next day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) April went to the Dr. and got some disease. (B) April took night time medicine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that April took some medicine to alleviate her symptoms and was able to recover enough to go back to school the next day. Going to the doctor and getting a disease would likely take more time to recover from and may require more extensive treatment."}}
{"Q": "Jane was at a grocery store. Which event could cause And only bought almond milk from then on?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jane found out that almond milk was better for you. (B) Jane spilled almond milk while at the store.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Jane found out that almond milk was better for you.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jane made a conscious decision to switch to almond milk after learning about its health benefits, rather than accidentally spilling it and then deciding to only buy that type of milk from then on."}}
{"Q": "Marcus wanted to join his high school football team. Which event could cause At the end of tryouts he made the team and was very proud?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Marcus went to try out day and tried out. (B) Marcus practiced hockey really hard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more likely that Marcus making the football team was a result of him attending tryouts and performing well, rather than practicing a different sport like hockey. The sentence specifically mentions tryouts, indicating that this was the event that led to Marcus making the team."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy's dad took him to see his favorite baseball team. Which event could cause Leaping up, Jimmy was thrilled to successfully catch the ball?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jimmy saw a homerun ball headed toward him. (B) Jimmy threw the ball near his dad.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jimmy saw a homerun ball headed toward him.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jimmy would leap up and be thrilled to catch a homerun ball, as it is a rare and exciting event in a baseball game. Throwing the ball near his dad would not likely cause such a strong reaction from Jimmy."}}
{"Q": "Stan's toddler flushed something down the toilet. Which event could cause Then he retrieved Stan's son's toy from the pipes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A plumber arrived and turned off the water. (B) He realized that it was his son's toy and clogged up the pipes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Stan realized it was his son's toy and attempted to retrieve it from the pipes himself, rather than waiting for a plumber to arrive and turn off the water. Plumbers typically do not turn off the water unless it is necessary for the repair, and it would be more efficient for Stan to retrieve the toy himself rather than waiting for a professional to arrive. Additionally, if the toy was causing a clog in the pipes, it is likely that Stan would have noticed the issue and attempted to fix it himself."}}
{"Q": "While I was in college, I had met an older man. Which event could cause I have negative memories of that time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was very creepy, and I was glad to cut him out of my life. (B) The younger man became mean to me and I had to leave.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the older man was very creepy, it is likely that the individual would have negative memories of that time. This could include feeling uncomfortable or unsafe around the older man, and ultimately deciding to cut him out of their life. On the other hand, if the younger man became mean, it may have been a negative experience, but it would not necessarily be directly related to the older man and their initial meeting."}}
{"Q": "I've always wanted a dog, but my mom thinks I'm irresponsible. Which event could cause On my birthday, I got a golden retriever puppy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I showed her I wasn't responsible. (B) My mom surprised me with exactly what I wanted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If the mom surprised the child with a golden retriever puppy on their birthday, it would indicate that the mom has changed her mind about the child's responsibility and has decided to give them a chance to prove themselves. It would also show that the mom is willing to compromise and make her child happy on a special occasion. On the other hand, if the child had shown irresponsibility in the past, it is unlikely that the mom would suddenly change her mind and give them a dog as a gift."}}
{"Q": "Jan's parents won't stop pestering her about being single. Which event could cause Her parents buy the act and leave happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) jans parents stop talking about it. (B) Jan tells her parents shes married.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Jan tells her parents she's seeing someone.\nExplanation: Jan telling her parents she's married would be a lie and could cause more problems in the future. However, if Jan tells her parents she's seeing someone, it could give them hope that she's not going to be single forever and they may stop pestering her about it. This is a more plausible answer as it is a realistic solution to the problem without resorting to lying."}}
{"Q": "Sherry and her oldest daughter don't often see things eye to eye. Which event could cause It's hard to image two people who are more different?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sherry and her son don't look alike, but they think alike. (B) Sherry and her oldest daughter are frequently disagreeing on many subjects.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sherry and her oldest daughter are frequently disagreeing on many subjects.\nExplanation: This answer directly addresses the statement that Sherry and her oldest daughter don't often see things eye to eye. It suggests that they have different opinions and frequently argue, which could be a reason why they are so different. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it talks about Sherry's son, who is not mentioned in the question, and suggests that he and Sherry think alike, which is not relevant to the question."}}
{"Q": "John blinked his eyes and read the sign again. Which event could cause The prankster who had hacked the sign enjoyed the chaos he had caused?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sign he created was totally changed from his creation. (B) Someone had left the sign as stop instead of yield.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The sign he created was totally changed from his creation.\nExplanation: If the sign created by the prankster was totally changed from his original creation, it could have caused chaos and confusion among drivers, which would have given the prankster the satisfaction of causing chaos. On the other hand, if someone had left the sign as stop instead of yield, it would not necessarily cause chaos or confusion, and the prankster may not have enjoyed it as much. Therefore, option (A) seems like a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I came out of my class and walked to my locker. Which event could cause She took me to the school's nurse?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I hurt my hand and the teacher found me. (B) Sarah accidentally bumped into me and fell pretty hard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If the student hurt their hand and the teacher found them, it is possible that the teacher would send them to the nurse for treatment. However, if Sarah accidentally bumped into the student and fell, it is unlikely that the student would need to see the nurse unless they were injured in the incident."}}
{"Q": "Crissy wanted to see the new movie coming out. Which event could cause Crissy never sees the movie?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was able to find parking as the theater was empty. (B) Crissy forgot about it after the commercials stopped.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Crissy forgot about it after the commercials stopped.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because forgetting about the movie is a common human error, whereas finding parking in an empty theater is unlikely to prevent someone from seeing a movie. Additionally, the fact that Crissy wanted to see the movie suggests that she was interested in it and unlikely to give up on seeing it due to a lack of parking."}}
{"Q": "Last week I went rappelling with my friends. Which event could cause However thankfully i repelled safely?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) we had an accident. (B) It was very slippery and low.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) we had an accident.\nExplanation: Rappelling can be a dangerous activity if proper safety measures are not taken. It involves descending down a steep surface using ropes and harnesses. Any mistake or equipment failure can lead to a serious accident. Therefore, the possibility of having an accident while rappelling is higher than encountering a slippery and low surface. However, the author mentions that they repelled safely, indicating that they were able to avoid any mishap."}}
{"Q": "Lisa got a new toothbrush. Which event could cause Lisa always bought soft toothbrushes from then on?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was the first soft bristle tooth brush Lisa ever bought. (B) Lisa used the toothbrush and it was too short and scraped her gums.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If Lisa used the toothbrush and it was too short and scraped her gums, it would be a negative experience that could cause her to always buy soft toothbrushes in the future to avoid a similar situation. This is a more plausible answer than (A) because it is common for people to switch to a different type of toothbrush based on a negative experience with their current one."}}
{"Q": "Nate came out of the doctor's office. Which event could cause Nate immediately got up and cleaned himself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nate saw the doctor trip and fall on a patch of grass. (B) Nate fell and got dirty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Nate fell and got dirty.\nExplanation: If Nate fell and got dirty, it would be understandable for him to immediately get up and clean himself. On the other hand, if Nate saw the doctor trip and fall on a patch of grass, it would not necessarily require Nate to clean himself. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "We had cats in our workplace. Which event could cause She got sick and went home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One of the employees is allergic to peanuts. (B) Karen didn't know she was allergic to the cats.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Karen didn't know she was allergic to the cats.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Karen's sickness was caused by her allergy to the cats, rather than an employee being allergic to peanuts. If an employee was allergic to peanuts, it would not necessarily affect Karen's health. However, if Karen didn't know she was allergic to the cats and was exposed to them in the workplace, it could have caused her to get sick and go home."}}
{"Q": "Little Timmy loved making home movies. Which event could cause His parents were worried after they read his new script?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Timmy wrote a horrible script. (B) Timmy wrote a wonderful script.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Timmy wrote a horrible script.\nExplanation: If Timmy wrote a horrible script, it could contain inappropriate content or themes that would worry his parents. They may be concerned about the impact it could have on Timmy's mental health or the message it could send to others who view the film. On the other hand, if Timmy wrote a wonderful script, his parents would likely be proud and supportive of his creative endeavors."}}
{"Q": "Matthew is not allowed to eat or drink near the computer. Which event could cause Matthew looses computer privileges for a month?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Matthew had a cup of water at the computer. (B) Matthew had an empty cup at the computer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Since Matthew is not allowed to eat or drink near the computer, having a cup of water at the computer would be a violation of the rule. Even though the cup may be empty, the fact that it was brought near the computer could still potentially cause damage if it were to spill or accidentally knock over. Therefore, having a cup of water at the computer would be a more plausible event that could cause Matthew to lose computer privileges for a month."}}
{"Q": "I was inside of a comic shop. Which event could cause I went home and read it, and really liked it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I found a Spiderman I'd never seen. (B) I bought a tragedian.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I found a Spiderman I'd never seen.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that someone would be excited to read a comic they had never seen before, especially if it is a popular character like Spiderman. Additionally, the excitement of finding a new comic could lead to a desire to read it immediately and potentially enjoy it. On the other hand, buying a tragedian (which is not a common comic book genre) may not be as likely to result in a positive reading experience."}}
{"Q": "A Senator opposed a bill. Which event could cause It passed, ninety-nine to one?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They were know for being right. (B) He was in a minority on this bill.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He was in a minority on this bill.\nExplanation: If the Senator was in a minority on this bill, it means that the majority of the other Senators supported the bill. Therefore, even if the Senator opposed the bill, it could still pass with a vote of 99 to 1. The Senator's personal reputation or track record of being right would not necessarily have an impact on the outcome of the vote."}}
{"Q": "Lucy had a test tomorrow at school and she barely studied. Which event could cause Lucy failed the test because she had not studied?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy stayed up all night studying for the test. (B) Lucy chose not to study.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Lucy chose not to study, it is more likely that she would fail the test because she did not prepare for it. Staying up all night studying may not necessarily guarantee success if she did not study effectively or if she was too tired during the test."}}
{"Q": "Linda went to buy some frozen yogurt. Which event could cause Linda was very disappointed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They didn't have her favorite flavor there. (B) The store in Linda's neighborhood was closed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They didn't have her favorite flavor there.\nExplanation: Linda went to buy frozen yogurt, which suggests that she had a craving for it. If the store didn't have her favorite flavor, it would be a disappointment for her as she wouldn't be able to satisfy her craving. On the other hand, if the store in her neighborhood was closed, she could still go to another store and get her frozen yogurt fix. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Timmy was told many times not to play ball in the house. Which event could cause Since no one would admit it, the family vacation was cancelled?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Timmy broke the mirror but wouldn't admit it. (B) Timmy still played and broke a nail.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Timmy was repeatedly told not to play ball in the house, so it is plausible that he broke the mirror while playing ball and refused to admit it. This could cause the family vacation to be cancelled as the parents may not want to reward Timmy's disobedience and lack of responsibility by taking him on vacation. On the other hand, breaking a nail (option B) is not a significant enough event to warrant cancelling a family vacation."}}
{"Q": "Terry had a birthday and went to his favorite restaurant. Which event could cause The waiter did not sing so Terry sang to himself?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terry was excited to have happy birthday sang to him. (B) Terry thought that the restaurant staff forget about his birthday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Terry thought that the restaurant staff forget about his birthday.\n\nExplanation: If Terry was excited to have happy birthday sang to him, he would not have felt the need to sing to himself. However, if he thought that the restaurant staff forgot about his birthday, he may have taken matters into his own hands and sang to himself to make the occasion feel more special."}}
{"Q": "Mary-Anne was feeling lonely and decided to adopt a cat. Which event could cause She took the cat home with her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary-Anne found an affectionate and cute cat. (B) She saw a pitiful looking cat at the pet store.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mary-Anne found an affectionate and cute cat.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Mary-Anne would adopt a cat that she found affectionate and cute, rather than adopting a pitiful looking cat solely out of pity. People tend to choose pets that they feel a connection with and that they believe will bring them joy and companionship."}}
{"Q": "I used to work on Mechanical Turk Which event could cause Amazon decided to ban me?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I made too much debt. (B) I made too much money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) I made too much debt.\nExplanation: Amazon Mechanical Turk has strict policies regarding the quality of work and payment. If a worker consistently produces low-quality work or fails to complete tasks on time, requesters may reject their work, resulting in a decrease in their approval rating. This can lead to a decrease in the number of available tasks and, ultimately, a decrease in earnings. If a worker continues to accept tasks despite their low approval rating, they may accumulate debt, which can result in Amazon banning them from the platform. Therefore, it is more plausible that making too much debt would cause Amazon to ban a worker rather than making too much money."}}
{"Q": "Bill had relocated to a new town, and needed to find a gym. Which event could cause After visiting, Bill became a proud member of the gym?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He checked his phone for the closest gym to him. (B) He checked his phone for the closest cafe to him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Bill checked his phone for the closest gym to him, it is likely that he was actively searching for a gym and had an interest in joining one. After visiting the gym, he may have found it to be a good fit for his fitness goals and became a proud member. Checking his phone for the closest cafe would not be relevant to his search for a gym."}}
{"Q": "I left work grumpy because it was a long day. Which event could cause A nice lady helped me up and called an ambulance?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was tired and fell down. (B) When walking home, I stepped over a rock on the ground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If the person was tired and fell down, it is more plausible that they would need help getting up and possibly require medical attention. Stepping over a rock on the ground is not likely to result in a situation where someone would need an ambulance and a nice lady to help them."}}
{"Q": "Kate went into labor on Monday morning. Which event could cause The doctor delivered Kate's baby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her water broke and she was in pain on the way to the hospital. (B) Kate told the nurse to get a midwife.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Kate's water broke and she was in pain, it is likely that she was in active labor and needed medical attention. The doctor would be called to deliver the baby in this situation. On the other hand, if Kate simply requested a midwife, it is possible that she was not yet in active labor and the midwife could assist with the delivery. However, in most hospital settings, doctors are typically the ones who deliver babies, so it is more plausible that the doctor was called due to Kate's water breaking and being in pain."}}
{"Q": "My back was aching from work. Which event could cause My back felt much better afterwards?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I decided to stand up for a bit. (B) I went to see the Chiropactor for an adjustment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If the back pain was caused by work-related strain or misalignment, a chiropractic adjustment could help realign the spine and relieve tension in the muscles, resulting in a reduction in pain. While standing up for a bit may provide temporary relief, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the underlying cause of the pain."}}
{"Q": "Joan's grandma had to go to a nursing home. Which event could cause She packed the jars, dusted them, and put them on a shelf at home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joan's grandma is getting very old and she was doing unwanted things in home. (B) Joan took some jars her grandma couldn't stand anymore.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Joan took some jars her grandma couldn't stand anymore.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly relates to the action of packing and dusting the jars. If Joan's grandma was doing unwanted things in the home, it is unlikely that Joan would pack and dust jars as a response. However, if Joan took some jars that her grandma couldn't stand anymore, it would make sense for her to pack and dust them before putting them on a shelf at home."}}
{"Q": "Ned went on vacation in Peru. Which event could cause Ned managed to make it to the top with the porter's assistance?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He had too much luggage to carry at the hotel. (B) Ned's hotel room was on the first floor thankfully as the elevators weren't working.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He had too much luggage to carry at the hotel.\nExplanation: If Ned had too much luggage to carry at the hotel, it is plausible that he would need assistance from a porter to carry his luggage up to his room. This would also suggest that Ned may have had a lot of luggage with him on his trip, which could make it difficult for him to climb to the top without assistance. On the other hand, option B does not seem to be related to Ned's ability to climb to the top with the porter's assistance."}}
{"Q": "The giraffe tried to eat the leaves. Which event could cause The Giraffe ate all the leaves on the tree?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was no longer starving and was finally full. (B) He was starving and was not getting full.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was no longer starving and was finally full.\n\nExplanation: If the giraffe tried to eat the leaves, it means that there were still leaves on the tree for it to eat. Option A is more plausible because if the giraffe was no longer starving and was finally full, it would stop eating the leaves and leave some for later. Option B suggests that the giraffe was not getting full, which would mean it would continue to eat all the leaves until there were none left on the tree."}}
{"Q": "Frank loves to go to this certain deli by his apartment. Which event could cause Now Frank has to find a new place to eat a sandwich?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Frank's favorite deli opened. (B) Frank was sad to learn the deli closed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Frank's favorite deli closed, he would have to find a new place to eat a sandwich. On the other hand, if the deli opened, he would still be able to go there and enjoy his favorite sandwich. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom thought he was an amazing chess player. Which event could cause Tom was both amazed and humbled at his dad?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's dad couldn't beat him at chess. (B) Tom played his dad and lost the chess game.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom played his dad and lost the chess game.\nExplanation: If Tom thought he was an amazing chess player, losing to his dad would be a humbling experience. It would also be amazing to see his dad's skills and realize that there is still much to learn and improve upon. Option A would not cause Tom to be amazed and humbled, as it would only reinforce his belief that he is a great chess player."}}
{"Q": "Elizabeth is a very proper woman. Which event could cause Elizabeth fell over and landed right in the puddle, getting muddy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She often sticks her hands in the air as if to raise the roof. (B) Elizabeth wore high heels on a rainy day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Elizabeth wore high heels on a rainy day.\nExplanation: Wearing high heels on a rainy day can be very dangerous as the heels can easily slip on wet surfaces. Elizabeth's proper nature may have caused her to prioritize fashion over practicality, leading to her falling over and getting muddy. This scenario is more plausible than option (A) as it is unlikely that a proper woman like Elizabeth would engage in such a wild gesture as raising the roof."}}
{"Q": "Jess had a job as a aircraft cleaner. Which event could cause Her boss told her to stop keeping books?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jess loves all the books that she finds on the planes. (B) Jess never kept books on the side and was very tired.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jess loves all the books that she finds on the planes.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jess's boss told her to stop keeping books because she was taking too many books from the planes and not focusing on her job as an aircraft cleaner. If Jess loves all the books she finds on the planes, she may be tempted to take more than she should, which could be seen as a distraction from her job duties. On the other hand, option B does not provide a clear reason why Jess's boss would tell her to stop keeping books."}}
{"Q": "The Smith's could not find their cat. Which event could cause The Smith's cat meowed at the front door?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Smiths cat escaped out of the front door. (B) The Smith's cat escaped to the basement.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The Smiths cat escaped out of the front door.\nExplanation: If the Smiths could not find their cat, it is more likely that the cat escaped out of the front door rather than to the basement. Additionally, the fact that the cat meowed at the front door suggests that it was trying to get back inside the house, which further supports the idea that it escaped through the front door."}}
{"Q": "Jed followed the instructions to compile Chromium OS. Which event could cause Finally he gave up, and learned to love Windows?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jed found it very easy to compile. (B) It was very difficult though.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It was very difficult though.\nExplanation: Compiling Chromium OS is a complex and time-consuming process that requires a lot of technical knowledge and expertise. If Jed found it very difficult to compile, he might have become frustrated and given up on the process. This could have led him to switch back to using Windows, which is a more user-friendly operating system."}}
{"Q": "Arthur was smitten with the boss's daughter, Anka. Which event could cause It wasn't long before he learned first hand of her peanut allergy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Arthur worshipped her from afar. (B) Arthur made Anka a wonderful peanut brittle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Arthur made Anka a wonderful peanut brittle.\nExplanation: This event could cause Arthur to learn first hand of Anka's peanut allergy because if he made her a peanut brittle, she would have had an allergic reaction after eating it. This would have been a clear indication to Arthur that Anka has a peanut allergy."}}
{"Q": "Last April I woke to the sound of tornado sirens. Which event could cause When it was over we looked outside at the destruction?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) April spent the night in the basement. (B) I had to go outside to wait out the tornado.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I had to go outside to wait out the tornado.\nExplanation: If the person heard tornado sirens and then looked outside at the destruction, it is more likely that they had to go outside to wait out the tornado and then saw the aftermath. If they had spent the night in the basement, they would not have been able to see the destruction until they came out of the basement."}}
{"Q": "My friend had a Yerbie Frisbee that goes really far. Which event could cause We never saw that Frisbee again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My friend threw the frisbee a foot. (B) A dog came along and took it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) A dog came along and took it.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because dogs are known to be attracted to Frisbees and may take them if they are left unattended. Additionally, if the Frisbee went really far, it may have landed in an area where dogs are known to roam. On the other hand, it is unlikely that a Frisbee that goes really far would be lost after being thrown only a foot."}}
{"Q": "Ashley was going to the cafeteria for lunch. Which event could cause After that she was the only one in the lunch line?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She got in line for lunch with everyone else. (B) People learned a cheese burger is not on today's menu.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) People learned a cheese burger is not on today's menu.\nExplanation: If people learned that a cheese burger is not on today's menu, they may decide to go elsewhere for lunch or choose a different option from the cafeteria. This could result in Ashley being the only one left in the lunch line. Option (A) is less likely as it assumes that everyone else in the lunch line would have finished before Ashley, which is not necessarily the case."}}
{"Q": "Mike decided to volunteer for a farm. Which event could cause But he was given lots of free vegetables?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mike didn't actually like it very much. (B) It was fun work for a lot of pay.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Mike didn't actually like volunteering on the farm, it's possible that the farmer gave him lots of free vegetables as a way to thank him for his time and effort. This would be a way to show appreciation and encourage him to come back and volunteer again in the future. On the other hand, if Mike found the work fun and rewarding, he might not need or want extra compensation in the form of free vegetables. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Me and my friends were hanging out. Which event could cause Afterwards, we went to a diner and got food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We felt full when we were hanging out. (B) We got bored and started playing a video game. Then we got hungry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the group got hungry after playing a video game and getting bored, rather than feeling full from hanging out. Playing a video game can be a mentally stimulating activity that can work up an appetite, leading the group to go to a diner and get food afterwards."}}
{"Q": "Ana had been putting off doing laundry. Which event could cause Ana took several hours drying medicinal herbs?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Other things had to do her first though. (B) She had to do other things first though.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Other things had to do her first though.\nExplanation: This answer suggests that Ana had other tasks or responsibilities that she needed to attend to before she could do her laundry. This could have caused her to delay doing laundry and instead focus on drying medicinal herbs for several hours. Option B is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the given information."}}
{"Q": "Leo showed me a trick at movie theaters last week. Which event could cause It smelled fresh, and I was glad someone had been so wasteful earlier?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He said people leave things behind. We found sanitiser!. (B) Leo showed me how to record movies on my phone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Leo mentioning that people leave things behind at movie theaters could lead to the possibility of finding something useful or valuable. In this case, they found sanitizer which smelled fresh, indicating that it was recently left behind. Leo showing the narrator how to record movies on their phone has no connection to the statement about finding something useful or wasteful at the movie theater."}}
{"Q": "Tom saw a friendly dog while walking through the city. Which event could cause He took home a great dog and made a new best friend?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The dog was malnourished. (B) Tom befriend the dog and took him to a shelter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If Tom befriended the dog and took him to a shelter, it is possible that he could have adopted the dog and taken him home. This would have led to Tom having a new best friend in the form of the dog. However, if the dog was malnourished, it is unlikely that Tom would have taken him home immediately without first taking him to a shelter or seeking medical attention for the dog. Therefore, option B seems like a more plausible event that could have led to Tom taking home a great dog and making a new best friend."}}
{"Q": "Lily's favorite doll broke. Which event could cause Finally, the doll came back in perfect condition?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lily's parents took the doll to a toy shop. (B) Lily's grandmother broke her doll.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lily's parents took the doll to a toy shop.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lily's parents took the doll to a toy shop to get it fixed rather than Lily's grandmother breaking her doll and then magically fixing it. It is common for parents to take their child's broken toys to a repair shop to get them fixed. Therefore, option A is a more logical and realistic event that could cause the doll to come back in perfect condition."}}
{"Q": "Rick played saxophone in the marching band. Which event could cause Rick now plays the trombone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rick bought a trombone. (B) Rick grew bored, and wanted to try a new hobby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rick bought a trombone.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rick switched to playing the trombone because he acquired one, rather than simply growing bored and wanting to try a new hobby. Additionally, it is common for musicians to switch instruments or try new ones, especially if they have a natural aptitude for music."}}
{"Q": "Jim went to the beach. Which event could cause Jim was angry at his sister?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim's sister ditched him. (B) Jim's sister poured sand in the bucket.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jim's sister ditched him.\nExplanation: If Jim's sister ditched him, it means she left him alone without any explanation or reason. This could make Jim angry as he may have been looking forward to spending time with his sister at the beach. On the other hand, pouring sand in the bucket may not necessarily make Jim angry, as it could be seen as a playful act."}}
{"Q": "Schmidt had to take the bus to work. Which event could cause He got written up at work?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The bus was early picking Schmidt up. (B) Schmidt missed his stop was late to work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Schmidt missed his stop was late to work.\nExplanation: If Schmidt missed his stop and was late to work, it would be a valid reason for him to get written up at work. However, if the bus was early picking him up, it would not be his fault and would not result in him getting written up."}}
{"Q": "When Marlene graduated she went to work for her Uncle in California. Which event could cause Now Marline works as a maid at the hotel down the street?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her Uncle owned a hotel. (B) She did not get along with him and cried.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She did not get along with him and cried.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Marlene's relationship with her Uncle did not work out and she left his employment. It is unlikely that her Uncle owning a hotel would automatically lead to Marlene working as a maid at a different hotel down the street."}}
{"Q": "People shook their heads because Stu wouldn't buy a car. Which event could cause Stu rode his bike to visit them at the cemetery regularly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Stu's parents recovered from a car accident. (B) Stu's parents were killed in a car accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Stu's parents were killed in a car accident.\nExplanation: If Stu's parents were killed in a car accident, it would make sense for him to be hesitant to buy a car and instead rely on his bike for transportation. Additionally, visiting his parents' graves regularly would be a plausible reason for him to ride his bike to the cemetery. On the other hand, if Stu's parents recovered from a car accident, it wouldn't necessarily explain why he wouldn't buy a car or why he would ride his bike to the cemetery regularly."}}
{"Q": "I recall the one hit I got in Little League Which event could cause I made it to first just in time, not believing what I'd finally done?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I hit a foul ball right between the stands and third base. (B) I was very excited about the accomplishment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the speaker made it to first base due to hitting a foul ball between the stands and third base, as this would have given them enough time to run to first base before the ball was caught or retrieved by the opposing team. Option B, being excited about the accomplishment, does not explain how the speaker made it to first base."}}
{"Q": "Frankie had Christmas shopping to do. Which event could cause She paid and took her things home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Frankie went shopping and picked out some gifts. (B) Frankie went to the hardware store.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it directly relates to Christmas shopping and picking out gifts. Option B, going to the hardware store, does not seem to be related to Christmas shopping and therefore is less likely to result in Frankie paying for and taking home her gifts."}}
{"Q": "Billy and Rob were angry at each other over a proposed trade. Which event could cause Not wanting to be known as a cheater, Billy is out to confront Rob?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rob ended up cheating. (B) Rob told people that Billy cheated him in the trade.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Rob told people that Billy cheated him in the trade.\nExplanation: If Rob spread rumors that Billy cheated him, it could damage Billy's reputation and credibility. Therefore, Billy may feel the need to confront Rob to clear his name and defend himself against the false accusations. On the other hand, if Rob ended up cheating, Billy may not feel the need to confront him as the issue would have been resolved in his favor."}}
{"Q": "I used to have this girlfriend who was so needy. Which event could cause After a few months I ended up breaking up with her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My girlfriend wanted to be with me all the time and would never let me hang out with my friends. (B) Her constant begging was sexy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for the breakup was the girlfriend's neediness and clinginess, as indicated by her not allowing the person to spend time with their friends. This behavior can be suffocating and lead to feelings of being trapped, which could ultimately lead to the decision to end the relationship. Option B, on the other hand, seems unlikely as constant begging is not typically seen as a desirable trait in a partner."}}
{"Q": "The cat chased the mouse across the empty warehouse. Which event could cause The cat decided to lay down and take a nap?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The mouse was too fast for the cat. (B) The mouse chased the cat back to his hole.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The mouse was too fast for the cat.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cat got tired from chasing the mouse and decided to take a nap rather than the mouse chasing the cat back to his hole. The sentence states that the cat chased the mouse across the empty warehouse, indicating that the cat was actively pursuing the mouse. If the mouse chased the cat back to his hole, it would mean that the cat was running away from the mouse, which is not consistent with the initial sentence. Therefore, option (A) is a more likely cause for the cat's decision to take a nap."}}
{"Q": "Luke's grass in his yard was growing fast. Which event could cause Now Luke's yard is always well maintenanced?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Luke hired a company to pull up the grass. (B) Luke bought a new lawn mower to trim his lawn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Luke bought a new lawn mower to trim his lawn.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Luke would take steps to maintain his yard rather than completely removing the grass. Buying a new lawn mower would allow him to easily and efficiently trim the grass, keeping it well-maintained."}}
{"Q": "I drove my motorcycle across the street. Which event could cause I changed the wifi password to enhance security?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Across the street was a bar where I drank too much, and told all the patrons my wifi password. (B) Across the street was a bar I enver drank at and didn't tell anyone my wifi password.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person may have shared their wifi password after drinking too much at the bar across the street, which could have compromised the security of their network. Changing the password would be a logical step to enhance security in this scenario. On the other hand, if the person did not drink at the bar and did not share their password, there would be no reason to change it for security purposes."}}
{"Q": "Robert was planning on having a nice dinner with his girlfriend Kate. Which event could cause However she lied to Robert and told him she loved it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kate was planning on breaking up with David. (B) She didn't really like it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She didn't really like it.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kate didn't really like the dinner but didn't want to hurt Robert's feelings by telling him the truth. It is unlikely that Kate planning on breaking up with David would cause her to lie about enjoying the dinner with Robert."}}
{"Q": "Justin was carefully finishing his watercolor painting in art class. Which event could cause Justin was sad but decided to be kind to Laura?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Laura made a rude comment about his painting. (B) His friend Laura brought new paints so he gave her his.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Laura made a rude comment about his painting.\nExplanation: If Laura made a rude comment about Justin's painting, it could cause him to feel sad. However, Justin decided to be kind to Laura despite her comment, showing maturity and kindness. This scenario is more plausible than option (B) because it is more likely that a negative comment would cause sadness rather than a friend bringing new paints causing Justin to give them away."}}
{"Q": "Maureen notices that she is having trouble seeing things far away. Which event could cause Maureen is happy that she can see well again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Maureen decided to make an appointment to get her eye sight checked which was 20/20. (B) She went to the eye doctor and got glasses.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She went to the eye doctor and got glasses.\nExplanation: If Maureen is having trouble seeing things far away, it is likely that she has myopia (nearsightedness) or another vision problem that can be corrected with glasses. Making an appointment to get her eyes checked is a good first step, but if her vision is not 20/20, she will need some form of correction, such as glasses or contact lenses. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Neshay was making her famous chicken dinner for her boyfriend. Which event could cause When he finished her told her it was the best he ever ate?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He added some more spice and herbs to the chicken. (B) He was excited to eat it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He was excited to eat it.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Neshay's boyfriend enjoyed the chicken dinner because he was excited to eat it, rather than because he added some more spice and herbs to it. Adding more spice and herbs may enhance the flavor, but it does not necessarily guarantee that it will be the best chicken he ever ate. On the other hand, if he was excited to eat it, he may have had high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was, leading him to declare it as the best he ever ate."}}
{"Q": "I always wanted fancy socks. Which event could cause I was ashamed of what I had done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I bought a pair of socks I thought were really fancy but looked very ugly. (B) I bought a pair of socks I thought were really fancy but looked very ugly, so I returned them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If the person bought a pair of socks they thought were fancy but ended up looking ugly, they may feel embarrassed or ashamed of their fashion choice. However, if they returned the socks, they took action to correct their mistake and may not feel as ashamed. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Neil loved the Middle East. Which event could cause He found Bahrain was every bit as lovely as he had dreamed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Neil decided to travel to the Far East. (B) Neil saved up for a two week vacation and visited the entire area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Neil saved up for a two week vacation and visited the entire area.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Neil had the opportunity to visit Bahrain and other countries in the Middle East during a two week vacation. This would give him the chance to explore the culture, history, and beauty of the region, and to see for himself that Bahrain was every bit as lovely as he had dreamed. On the other hand, option (A) suggests that Neil decided to travel to the Far East, which is a completely different region and would not explain why he found Bahrain to be lovely."}}
{"Q": "Lucy and her grandma went to Walmart. Which event could cause It wasn't what she wanted, but it was better than nothing at all?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy's wanted candy, but her grandma bought her an apple. (B) Grandma made Lucy turn tricks for money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: In this scenario, Lucy's grandma bought her an apple instead of candy. While it may not have been exactly what Lucy wanted, it was still better than not getting anything at all. The second option, where Lucy is forced to engage in prostitution, is not only highly implausible but also inappropriate and disturbing."}}
{"Q": "My flight to Korea was today. Which event could cause I realized that this place is a little different from my home town?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When I got there, I knew none of the language. (B) I got there early and decided to stay in my hotel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. When I got there, I knew none of the language.\nExplanation: Language is a significant aspect of culture, and not being able to communicate effectively can be a jarring experience. If the person is from a country where the language is different from Korean, they may feel out of place and realize that they are in a different environment. On the other hand, deciding to stay in a hotel early may not necessarily expose the person to the cultural differences of the place."}}
{"Q": "Tess wanted to make her family pizza for dinner. Which event could cause She ordered a takeout pizza, which her family loved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tess didn't feel like spending money. (B) But her oven was broken.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) But her oven was broken.\nExplanation: If Tess's oven was broken, she wouldn't be able to make pizza at home. Ordering takeout pizza would be a reasonable alternative in this situation. Option (A) doesn't make sense because if Tess didn't want to spend money, she could have made pizza at home using ingredients she already had. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Karen didn't have a boyfriend for Valentine's Day. Which event could cause Her brother's thoughtfulness made her Valentine's Day special?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Karen decided to buy her brother a Valentine's gift. (B) Karens little brother handed her a box of chocolates.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Karens little brother handed her a box of chocolates.\nExplanation: Karen's little brother's thoughtfulness in giving her a box of chocolates could have made her Valentine's Day special, as it shows that someone cares for her and wants to make her happy. This gesture could have lifted her spirits and made her feel loved, even if she didn't have a romantic partner. On the other hand, Karen deciding to buy her brother a Valentine's gift may have been a kind gesture, but it wouldn't necessarily have made her own Valentine's Day special."}}
{"Q": "Dana's son had some homework. Which event could cause They finished the worksheet quickly?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dana's son was working on a worksheet with mom. (B) Dana's son helped Dana finish it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Dana's son was working on a worksheet with mom.\nExplanation: If Dana's son was working on the worksheet with his mom, it is likely that they were able to finish it quickly because they were working together and could help each other if needed. On the other hand, if Dana's son helped Dana finish it, it implies that Dana was struggling with the worksheet and needed her son's help, which may have taken longer to complete."}}
{"Q": "Mary went to a cafe. Which event could cause They decided they would go to the park together on Saturday?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) At the cafe, Mike caught up with an old friend. (B) Mary ran into an ex boyfriend at the cafe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) At the cafe, Mike caught up with an old friend.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary and Mike decided to go to the park together on Saturday because they caught up with each other and made plans, rather than Mary running into an ex-boyfriend. Running into an ex-boyfriend may cause some awkwardness or discomfort, but it is unlikely to lead to making plans to hang out with someone else. On the other hand, catching up with an old friend can lead to making plans to spend time together."}}
{"Q": "Ronnie was hanging out with his friends after school. Which event could cause Ronnie got caught by the cashier and he got in big trouble afterwards?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ronnie and his friends took candy from a store without paying for it. (B) Ronnie left his friends when they decided to steal a candy bar.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Taking candy from a store without paying for it is a clear act of theft and could result in Ronnie getting caught by the cashier and facing consequences. Leaving his friends when they decided to steal a candy bar would not necessarily lead to Ronnie getting caught or getting in trouble, as he did not participate in the theft."}}
{"Q": "Gina had checked out a book from the library. Which event could cause She knew she had to go home and search her house to find it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gina got a late fee on the book. (B) she had to get something to eat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Gina got a late fee on the book.\nExplanation: If Gina got a late fee on the book, it would indicate that the due date had passed and she had not returned the book. This would prompt her to search her house to find the book so she could return it and avoid further fees or penalties. On the other hand, needing to get something to eat would not necessarily be related to finding the book and would not be a plausible reason for her to search her house."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's grandma was teaching her to sew. Which event could cause Lucy finally agreed to start with a pillow?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy wanted to try something difficult but her grandma told her to do a pillow. (B) Lucy decided not to sew.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy wanted to try something difficult but her grandma told her to do a pillow.\nExplanation: It is common for beginners to want to try something challenging right away, but it is important to start with a simple project to learn the basics. Lucy's grandma, who is experienced in sewing, would know this and suggest starting with a pillow. This scenario is more plausible than Lucy deciding not to sew altogether, as she was already interested in learning from her grandma."}}
{"Q": "Julius was tired of waking up to his noisy neighbors. Which event could cause Julius then decided to move and was happy with the decision?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Julius thought about looking for new places to live. (B) Julius began the process of house hunting.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Julius began the process of house hunting.\nExplanation: If Julius only thought about looking for new places to live, it does not necessarily mean that he will actually move. However, if he began the process of house hunting, it shows that he is actively taking steps towards finding a new home and is more likely to follow through with the decision to move. Additionally, if he finds a new home that is quieter and more to his liking, he will likely be happy with his decision to move."}}
{"Q": "Jason had doubts about starting a new relationship. Which event could cause When he woke up the next morning, he thought an angel was next to him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jason had his new girlfriend stay over one night. (B) Jason didn't meet anyone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jason had his new girlfriend stay over one night.\nExplanation: If Jason had his new girlfriend stay over one night, it would be more plausible for him to wake up next to her and have the thought that an angel was next to him. This event could potentially alleviate his doubts about starting a new relationship and make him feel more positive about it. On the other hand, if Jason didn't meet anyone, it would be unlikely for him to have such a thought and it wouldn't necessarily address his doubts about starting a new relationship."}}
{"Q": "Amy was 19 and she needed a job. Which event could cause It was further than she liked, but Amy was happy to have a job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy got a job at the mall. (B) Amy got a job next door.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Amy got a job at the mall.\nExplanation: Since Amy needed a job, getting a job at the mall would be a plausible option for her. Even though it may be further than she would have liked, she would still be happy to have a job and a source of income. On the other hand, getting a job next door may not necessarily be a guaranteed option for her, and it may not be enough to meet her financial needs."}}
{"Q": "Nate went to the movies! Which event could cause But he ate so much he ended up missing the movie?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nate went to the buffet beforehand. (B) He didn't eat a lot of food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Nate went to the buffet beforehand.\nExplanation: If Nate went to a buffet beforehand and ate too much, it is more likely that he would miss the movie due to feeling too full or experiencing discomfort. On the other hand, if he didn't eat a lot of food, it is less likely that he would miss the movie due to overeating."}}
{"Q": "Wyman and his family were tent camping. Which event could cause They saw bear prints around the picnic table?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wyman and his family inspected the area and found nothing scary. (B) Wyman thought he heard growling coming from the picnic area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Wyman and his family inspected the area and found nothing scary.\nExplanation: If Wyman and his family inspected the area and found nothing scary, it is more plausible that they simply stumbled upon bear prints rather than actually encountering a bear. It is common for bears to roam around campsites, especially if there is food present. However, if Wyman thought he heard growling coming from the picnic area, it would be more likely that there was an actual bear nearby, rather than just bear prints."}}
{"Q": "Jerry was always made fun of at work. Which event could cause He now gets to tell those coworkers what to do?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He decided to put all his energy into getting a promotion. (B) He decided to put all his energy into getting laid.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jerry worked hard to get a promotion and was successful, which led to him being in a position of authority over his former coworkers. Putting all his energy into getting laid would not necessarily lead to a promotion or a change in his work dynamic."}}
{"Q": "Jason went to a soup kitchen to get some food. Which event could cause After eating, Jason realized the kitchen does need more cultural?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The soup was very spicy. (B) The soup was very bland.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The soup was very bland.\nExplanation: If the soup was very spicy, it is unlikely that Jason would have thought that the kitchen needs more cultural. Spicy food is often associated with cultural cuisine, so it would not make sense for Jason to think that the kitchen needs more cultural if the soup was spicy. However, if the soup was very bland, Jason may have thought that the kitchen needs more cultural because the lack of flavor could indicate a lack of cultural diversity in the kitchen's cooking."}}
{"Q": "Cody works in retail, at Target. Which event could cause Unfortunately, he has to close again tomorrow?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) he talked to his boss about trying to get earlier hours. (B) Cody hated working days and preferred the late shift.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Cody's preference for the late shift is more likely to cause him to have to close again tomorrow, as it suggests that he may not be as motivated to work during the day and may have requested to work the late shift instead. This could result in him being scheduled to close more often, especially if other employees prefer to work during the day. On the other hand, talking to his boss about getting earlier hours would not necessarily result in him having to close again tomorrow."}}
{"Q": "Joe tripped carrying a carton of milk. Which event could cause They seemed grumpy when he wiped up the spill?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe saw employees looking at him. (B) Luckily, the carton didn't break.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Joe saw employees looking at him, it could make him feel embarrassed or self-conscious, which could lead to him interpreting their behavior as grumpiness. On the other hand, if the carton didn't break, there would be no spill to clean up, so it wouldn't make sense for anyone to be grumpy about it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gina was a new girl on a private, elite college campus. Which event could cause She had been pranked, as it wasn't a costume party?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She joioned a serority on campus. (B) She joined a gang on campus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She joined a sorority on campus.\nExplanation: Joining a sorority on a private, elite college campus often involves initiation rituals and pranks. It is common for new members to be pranked as a way of welcoming them into the group. On the other hand, joining a gang on campus is highly unlikely in a private, elite college setting, and it is not a common occurrence. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kelly decided to make some granola homemade. Which event could cause She saw the oats burned and she immediately shut the oven off?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly got distracted but remembered her oats in the oven. (B) Kelly left the kitchen to go to the bathroom and came back right to the kitchen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Kelly was actively monitoring her granola and noticed the oats burning, prompting her to shut off the oven immediately. Option (B) suggests that Kelly left the kitchen unattended, which is not a safe practice when cooking or baking."}}
{"Q": "Billy was walking at Central Park. Which event could cause Billy ended up very wet from his walk at the park?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It started raining during Billy's walk. (B) It started raining after Billy got home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It started raining during Billy's walk.\n\nExplanation: If it started raining during Billy's walk, he would have been caught in the rain and could have ended up very wet. On the other hand, if it started raining after Billy got home, he would not have been affected by the rain during his walk and would not have ended up very wet. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lynette hated being the older child. Which event could cause Lynette still babysits to help the family?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lynette felt her working parents should pay for a babysitter. (B) Lynette had to babysit her siblings.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lynette had to babysit her siblings.\nExplanation: Even though Lynette hated being the older child, she may still feel a sense of responsibility towards her younger siblings. Additionally, if her parents are working and cannot afford a babysitter, Lynette may feel obligated to help out and babysit her siblings. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My sister was failing her science class at school. Which event could cause She ended up passing her class with my help?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I helped my sister study. (B) I asked them for help.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I helped my sister study.\nExplanation: By helping her study, she was able to better understand the material and improve her grades. Asking for help may have also been beneficial, but actively studying and reviewing the material with her would have had a more direct impact on her success in the class."}}
{"Q": "Ray was looking for a birthday present for his mom. Which event could cause Ray's mom was really surprised and happy with the Fitbit Ray bought?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bought her the apple watch she always wanted. (B) Ray's mom recently started walking to lose weight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Ray's mom recently started walking to lose weight, so a Fitbit would be a perfect gift to help her track her progress and motivate her to keep going. It shows that Ray is supportive of his mom's goals and wants to help her achieve them. While an Apple Watch may also be a nice gift, it may not be as practical or relevant to his mom's current interests and needs."}}
{"Q": "John was an elementary school student. Which event could cause John went on to become a famous musician?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John was very good at music but grew out of it. (B) John was not very good at music in elementary school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If John was very good at music in elementary school, it is more likely that he would continue to pursue it and potentially become a famous musician. However, if he was not very good at music in elementary school, it is less likely that he would continue to pursue it and become a famous musician. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sally had been out all night. Which event could cause Finally, she made it to her room?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sally was awake and wanted to go back to the pool. (B) Sally was tipsy, and had trouble finding her way.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sally was tipsy, and had trouble finding her way.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if Sally had been out all night and was tipsy, it would make sense that she had trouble finding her way back to her room. Being under the influence of alcohol can impair one's judgment and coordination, making it difficult to navigate unfamiliar surroundings. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Sally would want to go back to the pool after being out all night, as she would likely be tired and ready to rest."}}
{"Q": "Todd was excited about being on his junior high basketball team. Which event could cause Todd eventually dropped from the team, mad that he never got to play?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Todd was on the playing roaster during every game. (B) Todd's coach always sidelined him because he was new on the team.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Todd's coach always sidelined him because he was new on the team.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Todd's lack of playing time was due to his coach's decision to give more playing time to more experienced players rather than Todd being on the playing roaster during every game and still not getting to play. It is common for coaches to prioritize more experienced players over new ones, especially in junior high school sports. This could have caused Todd to become frustrated and eventually drop from the team."}}
{"Q": "Tim never smoked before. Which event could cause He was punished but it was too late?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided it would be terrible to try out. (B) His friend talked him into trying a cigarette and he liked it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His friend talked him into trying a cigarette and he liked it.\n\nExplanation: If Tim's friend talked him into trying a cigarette and he liked it, he may continue to smoke despite the potential consequences. If he is punished for smoking, it may be too late to prevent him from becoming addicted or developing health problems. On the other hand, if Tim decides it would be terrible to try smoking, he is less likely to start and therefore less likely to be punished for smoking."}}
{"Q": "I was at work when it started snowing. Which event could cause We had a lazy snow day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) By the afternoon the office was closed on account of the weather. (B) My boss kept up from going home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) By the afternoon the office was closed on account of the weather.\nExplanation: If the office was closed due to the weather, it is more likely that everyone would have a snow day rather than just one person being kept from going home by their boss. Additionally, if the office was closed, it would be considered a lazy snow day as there would be no work to be done."}}
{"Q": "At the age of 27 I weighed 300 pounds. Which event could cause After a year, I lost 100 lbs and completed a marathon?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had to diet and exercise or die young. (B) I worked hard with my doctor to gain my weight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Losing 100 pounds and completing a marathon is a significant achievement that requires a lot of hard work and dedication. Option A, which suggests that the individual had to diet and exercise to avoid health problems, is a more plausible explanation for this transformation. Option B, which implies that the individual worked hard with their doctor to gain weight, does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Ana had been putting off doing laundry. Which event could cause Ana decided never to wait that long again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She had so much to do it took an hour to finish. (B) Ana had multiple loads to wash.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ana had multiple loads to wash.\nExplanation: If Ana had multiple loads to wash, it would mean that she had let her laundry pile up for a long time, which could be overwhelming and time-consuming to complete. This could be a more plausible reason for Ana to decide never to wait that long again, as it would be a clear indication that procrastinating on laundry can lead to a bigger problem in the future. On the other hand, if it took Ana only an hour to finish her laundry, it might not be a significant enough event to motivate her to change her behavior."}}
{"Q": "Wyatt and his friends were in class. Which event could cause In the end, he decided not to and stood up for the girl instead?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wyatt was making fun of a girl. (B) Wyatt's friends were making fun of a girl.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Wyatt's friends were making fun of a girl.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Wyatt would stand up for the girl if his friends were the ones making fun of her, rather than Wyatt himself. It shows that Wyatt has a sense of empathy and is willing to go against his friends to do what is right."}}
{"Q": "Eli was very tired when he got home. Which event could cause He plopped down in front of the television with a microwave dinner?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eli didn't have the energy to make himself a cooked meal. (B) Too fatigued to cook, Eli warmed up a frozen dinner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Too fatigued to cook, Eli warmed up a frozen dinner.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that Eli was very tired when he got home, which implies that he did not have the energy to cook a meal from scratch. Therefore, it is more plausible that he opted for a quick and easy option like a microwave dinner, which he could warm up quickly without much effort. Choice (B) accurately reflects this scenario."}}
{"Q": "A few years ago, everyone around me was learning to skateboard. Which event could cause I never learned to skate properly?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I decided to try it, but never cared. (B) I untried to join in once, but could not balance on a board.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the individual tried to join in but could not balance on a board, rather than simply not caring to try. Additionally, if everyone around them was learning to skateboard, it is likely that the individual would have at least attempted to try it out."}}
{"Q": "I found a trolley part in the garbage near a carhouse. Which event could cause I went back to the carhouse but found nothing else?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I thought there might be more parts around. (B) I wanted to see if I could return it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If the person found a trolley part in the garbage near a carhouse, it is plausible that they would think there might be more parts around and go back to check. On the other hand, wanting to return the part seems less likely as it was found in the garbage and may not have any identifying information."}}
{"Q": "Bill decided to go to the gym for exercise. Which event could cause He stopped along the way to purchase a smoothie?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bill realized he hadn't eaten all decade. (B) Bill wanted to eat something before going to the gym.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Bill wanted to eat something before going to the gym.\nExplanation: It is common for people to eat something before exercising to provide energy and prevent low blood sugar levels. Therefore, it is more plausible that Bill stopped to purchase a smoothie because he wanted to eat something before going to the gym. Option (A) is not a realistic reason for stopping to purchase a smoothie."}}
{"Q": "Rod bought his mom a locket for her birthday. Which event could cause He gave them to his mom in her new locket?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rod then took pictures of his mom and his wife to complete the gift. (B) He had photos taken of his children.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it directly relates to the locket that Rod bought for his mom. It makes sense that he would give her the locket with pictures of her and his wife inside as a complete gift. Option B is less likely because it does not involve the locket that Rod bought for his mom."}}
{"Q": "Sam loved cooking, but her school had no cooking club. Which event could cause Now Sam cooks, helps - and looks great on her college forms?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Luckily the next semester they did offer some other good clubs. (B) So instead Sam got a job in a restaurant kitchen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Luckily the next semester they did offer some other good clubs.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Sam found a solution within her school environment. It is common for schools to offer new clubs or activities each semester, so it is believable that Sam could have found a cooking club to join. Additionally, this answer implies that Sam continued to pursue her passion for cooking in a structured and organized way, which would look impressive on college applications. On the other hand, option B suggests that Sam completely changed her path and got a job in a restaurant kitchen, which may not be as realistic or feasible for a high school student."}}
{"Q": "Sam and Tom were fighting over a blanket. Which event could cause Sam pulled harder and won the fight?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were pulling it back and forth. (B) They both ate as much as they could.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Sam and Tom were pulling the blanket back and forth, it would create a situation where one person could pull harder and win the fight. On the other hand, eating as much as they could would not have any impact on the outcome of the fight over the blanket. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ellen dreamed of winning a prize for her roses. Which event could cause Ellen had to pay a replacement fee for her library card?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She sent her credit card by mistake when she entered the contest. (B) She decided to go to the library to do some research, but could not find her library card.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ellen lost her library card and had to pay a replacement fee than accidentally sending her credit card when entering a contest for her roses. Losing a library card is a common occurrence and often results in a replacement fee, while accidentally sending a credit card is less likely and not directly related to Ellen's dream of winning a prize for her roses."}}
{"Q": "Dan was not very good at Math. Which event could cause It was easy for him, and he felt much better about his math skills?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found a tutor who taught them a different way to think about math. (B) Dan studied and got a D on the math test.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He found a tutor who taught them a different way to think about math.\n\nExplanation: Finding a tutor who can teach math in a different way can help Dan understand the subject better and improve his skills. This can boost his confidence and make him feel better about his math abilities. On the other hand, getting a D on a math test may not necessarily make Dan feel better about his math skills, as it indicates that he still needs improvement."}}
{"Q": "Only two buses went anywhere near Laura's street. Which event could cause Laura had to get off and walk two miles home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Laura already missed the two buses. (B) The bus stopped next door to her house in front of a store.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Laura already missed the two buses.\n\nExplanation: If only two buses went near Laura's street and she missed both of them, then she would have no other option but to walk two miles home. On the other hand, if the bus stopped next door to her house in front of a store, she would not have to walk two miles home. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Dan wanted to find the perfect gift for his mother's birthday. Which event could cause Dan explained the situation and his mother was not upset?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan lost his pants. (B) He bought her a set of roses but dropped them on his way in to the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He bought her a set of roses but dropped them on his way in to the house.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is related to the situation of finding the perfect gift for his mother's birthday. Dropping the roses may have caused some disappointment, but it is not a major issue that would upset his mother. On the other hand, losing his pants is not related to the situation and would not have any impact on his mother's reaction."}}
{"Q": "I always wanted fancy socks. Which event could cause I loved my new socks?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I bought a pair at the store. (B) I wasn't able to save up for a new pair of socks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I bought a pair at the store.\nExplanation: If the person always wanted fancy socks, it is more likely that they would love their new socks if they were able to purchase a pair at the store. On the other hand, not being able to save up for a new pair of socks would likely result in disappointment rather than love for the socks."}}
{"Q": "Julian was mad after being fired from a diner. Which event could cause They knew it was him and banned him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Julian was sneaking food into the kitchen. (B) Julian decided to brake on window and the diner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Julian was caught sneaking food into the kitchen, it would be a violation of the diner's policies and could lead to his termination. Additionally, if the diner knew it was him, they may have banned him from the premises to prevent any further incidents. On the other hand, breaking a window would be a more extreme and unlikely event that would likely result in legal consequences rather than just being banned from the diner."}}
{"Q": "Johnny was afraid to hold sparklers. Which event could cause He hoped he would be brave enough next time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Johnny nervously held the sparklers. (B) Johnny declined to hold the sparklers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Johnny declined to hold the sparklers.\nExplanation: If Johnny declined to hold the sparklers, it means he was too afraid to do so. This event could cause him to hope that he would be brave enough next time to hold them. If he nervously held the sparklers, it would suggest that he overcame his fear and held them despite being afraid, which would not necessarily lead to him hoping to be braver next time."}}
{"Q": "Jasmine and her sister live near a wooded area. Which event could cause Both girls had a great time running around the trees?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jasmine and her sister loved to play in the woods. (B) The weather was rainy so they went out to play in it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jasmine and her sister loved to play in the woods.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly states that the girls enjoyed playing in the woods, which would naturally lead to them having a great time running around the trees. The weather being rainy (option B) may not necessarily be a factor in their enjoyment of playing in the woods."}}
{"Q": "We found ants in the water of our Keurig. Which event could cause They are finally gone, although we do not know the reason?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We washed our Keurig really well. (B) we left it alone and didn't clean it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We washed our Keurig really well.\n\nExplanation: It is more likely that washing the Keurig well removed any residue or food particles that may have attracted the ants, causing them to leave. Leaving the Keurig alone and not cleaning it would not have addressed the issue and would not have caused the ants to disappear."}}
{"Q": "James was searching for oil in North Dakota. Which event could cause James sold the oil for a very nice profit?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) James bought land with oil underneath. (B) He lost some oil on some private land.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. James bought land with oil underneath.\nExplanation: If James bought land with oil underneath, he would have the rights to extract and sell the oil, which could result in a profitable venture. On the other hand, losing some oil on private land would not necessarily lead to a significant profit."}}
{"Q": "The girls in town formed a new soccer team. Which event could cause Because of their hard work, they won their first game?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The girls worked soft and practiced daily. (B) The girls practiced many hours a week.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The girls practiced many hours a week.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the girls' hard work and dedication to practicing many hours a week led to their success in winning their first game. Working soft and practicing daily may not necessarily lead to the same level of improvement and success as putting in many hours of focused practice."}}
{"Q": "Sarah loved cooking. Which event could cause Sarah was touched and encouraged to cook more?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sarah's friends loved her food. (B) Sarah got a record as a gift.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sarah's friends loved her food.\nExplanation: When Sarah's friends loved her food, it would make her feel appreciated and encouraged to cook more. Positive feedback from others can be a great motivator to continue doing something that one loves. On the other hand, receiving a record as a gift may not necessarily have a direct impact on Sarah's passion for cooking."}}
{"Q": "Christopher moved to a new part of town because of a new job. Which event could cause Christopher will keep a map in his car from now on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He knew exactly where to go to the new job. (B) He got lost going to the new job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He got lost going to the new job.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Christopher will keep a map in his car if he got lost going to the new job. If he knew exactly where to go, he wouldn't need a map. However, if he got lost, he would want to make sure he has a map to avoid getting lost again in the future."}}
{"Q": "Ellen dreamed of winning a prize for her roses. Which event could cause Ellen ended up winning the prize?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ellen took care of her roses very well. (B) Ellen's roses were beautiful!.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ellen's roses were beautiful!\nExplanation: It is more likely that Ellen winning the prize was due to the beauty of her roses rather than just taking care of them well. The prize is usually awarded to the most beautiful or impressive roses, and Ellen's dream reflects her desire to achieve this. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Ellen's roses were the reason she won the prize."}}
{"Q": "Nick's neighbors played music as loud as they could. Which event could cause The situation was not resolved, but Nick felt better?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nick called no one to report the noise. (B) Nick asked them to turn it down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Nick asked them to turn it down.\nExplanation: If Nick asked his neighbors to turn down the music, it shows that he took action to resolve the situation. Even if the neighbors did not comply, Nick would feel better knowing that he tried to address the issue. On the other hand, if Nick did not call anyone to report the noise, he would likely still feel frustrated and powerless."}}
{"Q": "Jane loves music. Which event could cause Jane rushed to the office and was twenty minutes late to the concert?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jane had concert tickets she left at work. (B) Jane was going to watch a performance on video but had to stop at work first.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jane had concert tickets she left at work.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because Jane loves music and would likely have purchased tickets in advance to ensure she could attend the concert. If she left the tickets at work, she would have to rush back to retrieve them, causing her to be late. On the other hand, it is less likely that Jane would prioritize watching a performance on video over attending a live concert, especially if she had already purchased tickets."}}
{"Q": "Miles decided to join a book club in his town to meet people. Which event could cause Miles was very happy that he joined the book club?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Miles met a lot of people his own age. (B) Miles made new friends in the club.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Miles made new friends in the club.\nExplanation: Since Miles joined the book club to meet people, it is likely that he would be very happy if he made new friends in the club. Meeting people his own age (option A) is also a positive outcome, but making new friends would be a more direct and fulfilling result of joining the club."}}
{"Q": "Kate was jogging one day. Which event could cause Then she returned the phone to its grateful owner?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kate found a iphone while jogging. (B) Kate lost a phone on the path.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kate found an iPhone while jogging.\n\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it suggests that Kate stumbled upon a lost phone while she was out jogging. It makes sense that she would then return the phone to its owner, who would likely be grateful to have it back. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Kate lost her own phone while jogging, which would not explain why she returned it to its owner."}}
{"Q": "Freddy was going through sleep paralysis. Which event could cause His body started moving again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Freddy ran through the streets all night. (B) He concentrated hard on waking himself up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He concentrated hard on waking himself up.\nExplanation: Sleep paralysis occurs when the body is unable to move during the transition between sleep and wakefulness. It is often accompanied by vivid hallucinations and a feeling of being trapped. While physical activity such as running could potentially help break the paralysis, it is unlikely that Freddy would be able to move his body in such a state. On the other hand, focusing on waking oneself up is a common technique used to overcome sleep paralysis. By concentrating on moving a specific body part or repeating a mantra, Freddy may be able to regain control of his body and end the episode of sleep paralysis."}}
{"Q": "Tim was coloring at home. Which event could cause Tim spent the next day painting the way white?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim painted on the walls and floor. (B) Tim was so careful at coloring that his dad led him help paint the walkway.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Tim painted on the walls and floor.\nExplanation: If Tim painted on the walls and floor, it would require a lot of cleaning up the next day, which could involve repainting the affected areas. This would explain why Tim spent the next day painting the way white. On the other hand, option (B) seems less plausible because being careful at coloring would not necessarily lead to helping paint the walkway."}}
{"Q": "Gina entered her classroom and went to her desk. Which event could cause The fact that Tami was still talking to them made Gina uncomfortable?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tami had asked Gina not to talk with the gossip girls. (B) She started talking to some friends, but a bully named Tami butted in.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tami, a bully, interrupted Gina's conversation with her friends, making her uncomfortable. This scenario is more likely to cause discomfort than Tami simply asking Gina not to talk to the gossip girls."}}
{"Q": "Sam went door to door to try to sell magazines. Which event could cause The old man waved Sam off and told him to go?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam tried to persuade an old man to purchase. (B) Sam knocked on an old man,.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The old man waving Sam off and telling him to go suggests that Sam was trying to sell something to him. Option A states that Sam was trying to persuade an old man to purchase, which is the most plausible event that could have led to the old man's reaction. Option B suggests that Sam simply knocked on the old man's door, which may not necessarily result in the old man waving him off."}}
{"Q": "Mary-Anne was feeling lonely and decided to adopt a cat. Which event could cause She decided it was not the right cat?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cat tore up her new couch. (B) Mary-Anne was very mean to the cat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The cat tore up her new couch.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary-Anne would decide not to keep the cat if it caused damage to her furniture, rather than her being mean to the cat. It is also possible that the cat had other behavioral issues that made it difficult for Mary-Anne to care for it properly."}}
{"Q": "Ralph was a working dog. Which event could cause They weren't angry anymore when the bomb exploded up ahead?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ralph's owners were angry when he was making a lot of friends. (B) Ralph searched for the bomb restless, but couldn't find.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ralph searched for the bomb restless, but couldn't find.\nExplanation: Since Ralph was a working dog, it is more likely that he was trained to search for bombs or other dangerous items. Therefore, it is plausible that Ralph was searching for a bomb and couldn't find it, causing his owners to become frustrated. However, when the bomb exploded up ahead, the owners would have realized the importance of Ralph's training and skills, and would no longer be angry with him."}}
{"Q": "Shannon had been coughing every morning for weeks. Which event could cause After three weeks of electronic cigarettes, her cough subsided?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Shannon was smoking cigarettes a lot. (B) Shannon had quit smoking e-cigs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Shannon had quit smoking e-cigs.\n\nExplanation: Electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes, have been linked to respiratory problems such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Quitting e-cigarettes could lead to a reduction in these symptoms, which could explain why Shannon's cough subsided after three weeks of not using them. While smoking traditional cigarettes could also cause coughing, the fact that Shannon's cough improved after quitting e-cigarettes suggests that they were the more likely culprit."}}
{"Q": "Kelly and her friends went to a new ice cream shop. Which event could cause Kelly was glad she tried new flavors?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly's friends convinced her to stay with her usual flavor. (B) Kelly decided to get something other than her usual flavor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kelly decided to get something other than her usual flavor.\nExplanation: If Kelly decided to try a new flavor, it is more likely that she would be glad she tried it. Trying new things can be exciting and enjoyable, especially when it comes to food. On the other hand, if Kelly's friends convinced her to stick with her usual flavor, she may not have had the opportunity to try something new and may not have felt as satisfied with her experience at the ice cream shop."}}
{"Q": "Joe was helping his dad clear the woods in the back of their yard. Which event could cause Joe was angry he got hurt?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe fell over a log and laughed about it. (B) Joe fell over a log and hurt himself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe would be angry if he got hurt while clearing the woods with his dad. Falling over a log and hurting himself could cause frustration and anger, especially if it hindered their progress in clearing the woods. Laughing about it would suggest that the injury was not serious enough to cause anger."}}
{"Q": "Kelly and her friends went to a new ice cream shop. Which event could cause She threw up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kelly tried blueberry without knowing she was allergic to the dye. (B) Kelly tried a new flavor and loved it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Kelly is allergic to the dye in blueberry ice cream and she tries it without knowing, it could cause an allergic reaction and make her throw up. On the other hand, trying a new flavor and loving it would not cause her to throw up."}}
{"Q": "Mary had been dying to see her favorite band. Which event could cause When they got there, Mary realized she left the tickets at home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary was very excited. (B) Mary was very nervous.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Mary was very excited.\nExplanation: Mary's excitement to see her favorite band suggests that she had been looking forward to this event for a long time. It is common for people to become forgetful or make mistakes when they are overly excited or anxious about something. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mary's excitement caused her to forget the tickets at home rather than nervousness."}}
{"Q": "I loved smoked salmon. Which event could cause I contracted a bacterial infection from the smoked salmon?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I bought some smoked salmon from a very sketchy seller. (B) I didn't know how to cook it though and cooked it too long.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Consuming smoked salmon from a sketchy seller can increase the risk of contracting a bacterial infection such as Listeria or Salmonella. These bacteria can contaminate the fish during processing or storage, and can cause food poisoning even if the fish is properly cooked. Cooking the fish too long (option B) may affect the texture and taste of the salmon, but it is unlikely to cause a bacterial infection."}}
{"Q": "Han liked nature. Which event could cause And Han enjoyed watering and taking care of his neighbor's plants?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Han's neighbor hired him as a window washer. (B) he often loved walking through the forest near the park and going on walking trails.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) he often loved walking through the forest near the park and going on walking trails.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Han's love for nature. Enjoying walking through the forest and going on walking trails suggests that Han likes being outdoors and surrounded by nature. This interest in nature could also explain why he enjoys watering and taking care of his neighbor's plants. On the other hand, option (A) about being hired as a window washer does not seem to have any connection to Han's interest in nature or his enjoyment of taking care of plants."}}
{"Q": "When I was sixteen I learned to drive. Which event could cause My dad then took me to get my license?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My Mother taught me all the finer points. (B) I slept for weeks before my driver's test.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My Mother taught me all the finer points.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason why the father took the speaker to get their license was because their mother taught them how to drive. It is common for parents to take their children to get their license after they have completed their driver's education and training. Additionally, the fact that the speaker learned to drive at sixteen suggests that they had been practicing for some time, making it less likely that they would have slept for weeks before their driver's test."}}
{"Q": "Ky was a little chubby and wanted to lose 20 pounds before summer. Which event could cause And by summer, she had lost the other ten?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She started exercising and lost 10 lbs in a few eeeks. (B) Ky gained 20 pounds and now aimed for 30.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She started exercising and lost 10 lbs in a few weeks.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it aligns with the goal of losing weight before summer. By starting to exercise, Ky is taking a proactive approach to achieving her goal. Losing 10 pounds in a few weeks is a reasonable and achievable goal, especially with regular exercise and a healthy diet. On the other hand, option B is unlikely as it goes against Ky's original goal of losing weight and instead sets a new, unrealistic goal of gaining even more weight."}}
{"Q": "Jake was biking at the park. Which event could cause He put his dirty clothes into a plastic bag?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) While biking Jake got very sweaty. (B) He biked through some mud puddles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He biked through some mud puddles.\nExplanation: Biking through mud puddles could cause Jake's clothes to get dirty, which would be a reason for him to put them in a plastic bag. While sweating could make his clothes damp, it wouldn't necessarily make them dirty enough to warrant putting them in a bag. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Joe needed a new desk. Which event could cause Joe regretted his decision when the desk broke after two days?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe went to the goodwill to get him a new desk. (B) Joe went to the store to buy a new desk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: If Joe went to the store to buy a new desk, he likely spent more money and had higher expectations for the quality of the desk. If it broke after only two days, he would likely regret his decision to purchase it from the store. On the other hand, if he got a desk from the goodwill, he may not have had high expectations for its quality and may not have been as disappointed if it broke."}}
{"Q": "Joe was having a terrible time camping. Which event could cause But he couldn't find his car keys?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe wanted to stay. (B) Joe had a flat tire in the wild.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Joe had a flat tire in the wild.\nExplanation: If Joe had a flat tire in the wild, it would be a plausible reason for him to have a terrible time camping. It would leave him stranded and unable to leave the campsite, which could cause frustration and anxiety. On the other hand, not being able to find his car keys may be an inconvenience, but it would not necessarily ruin his entire camping experience."}}
{"Q": "Laura decided to fly all the way to New York City. Which event could cause Laura wore a hat all week to hide her hair?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Laura cut her hair by mistake. (B) When Laura got there she realized she forgot shampoo.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) When Laura got there she realized she forgot shampoo.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Laura would wear a hat all week to hide her hair if she forgot to bring shampoo rather than cutting her hair by mistake. Forgetting shampoo would leave her with greasy and unkempt hair, which she may feel self-conscious about. Wearing a hat would be a quick and easy solution to hide her hair until she could purchase shampoo or find an alternative solution."}}
{"Q": "Nate began writing stories for a few cents. Which event could cause He was just writing to help scientific research?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was getting paid close to nothing. (B) Nate was found by a researcher who paid him well.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Nate was found by a researcher who paid him well.\nExplanation: If Nate was just writing to help scientific research, it is more plausible that he would continue to do so if he found a researcher who valued his work and paid him well for it. This would allow him to continue contributing to scientific research while also being compensated fairly for his efforts. On the other hand, if he was getting paid close to nothing, he may have been more likely to seek out other opportunities that paid better, even if they were not related to scientific research."}}
{"Q": "I adopted a puppy. Which event could cause The carrots worked perfectly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I fed the puppy cooked beets. (B) I needed something for him to chew on.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I needed something for him to chew on.\nExplanation: The statement \"The carrots worked perfectly\" suggests that the puppy enjoyed chewing on the carrots. Therefore, it is more plausible that the event that caused this statement is related to the puppy's chewing behavior, which is addressed by option (B) - \"I needed something for him to chew on.\" Feeding the puppy cooked beets (option A) is not likely to have any direct impact on the statement."}}
{"Q": "We went on our first diving trip on Tuesday. Which event could cause We decided we went on our last diving trip on Tuesday?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We were almost eaten by a shark. (B) We have never had a better time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) We were almost eaten by a shark.\nExplanation: If the diving trip was a scary and dangerous experience due to a close encounter with a shark, it could cause the decision to not go on another diving trip in the future. On the other hand, if the trip was enjoyable and memorable, it is unlikely that it would be the last diving trip."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy grew up very poor. Which event could cause Jimmy called his parents and cursed at them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So he dropped out of school. And left home. (B) So he dropped out of the sky. And left home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. So he dropped out of school and left home.\nExplanation: Dropping out of school and leaving home could be a very stressful and emotional experience for Jimmy, especially if he grew up in poverty. It is possible that he may feel angry and frustrated with his parents for not being able to provide him with the support and resources he needed to succeed in school and in life. This could lead him to lash out and curse at them in a moment of intense emotion. On the other hand, dropping out of the sky is not a plausible event and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Sam's neck had been hurting recently. Which event could cause His neck no longer hurt with the added support?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam got a neck brace from his father. (B) Sam purchase a neck brace to increase pain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sam got a neck brace from his father.\nExplanation: A neck brace is a medical device that provides support to the neck and helps to reduce pain. If Sam's neck was hurting due to a strain or injury, wearing a neck brace could help to alleviate the pain by providing additional support to the neck muscles and reducing the strain on them. Therefore, it is more plausible that getting a neck brace from his father would help Sam's neck to no longer hurt, rather than purchasing a neck brace to increase pain."}}
{"Q": "Our friend owns a restaurant. Which event could cause The employee was not impressed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Our friend kept the restaurant open after hours. (B) Our friend tried to impress the employees with a free meal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Our friend kept the restaurant open after hours.\nExplanation: Keeping the restaurant open after hours could cause the employee to be not impressed as it could disrupt their work-life balance and affect their personal commitments. It could also lead to fatigue and burnout, which could affect their productivity and morale. On the other hand, offering a free meal to impress the employees could have a positive impact on their morale and motivation. Therefore, option A seems more plausible as a potential cause for the employee's lack of impression."}}
{"Q": "Elle's chorus was having a bake sale to raise money for new robes. Which event could cause The chorus had raised nearly half of what they needed in one day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Elle made lots of cookies to give away free. (B) Elles chorus really wanted new robes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Elle made lots of cookies to give away free.\nExplanation: If Elle made lots of cookies to give away free, it would attract more customers to the bake sale, resulting in more sales and potentially raising nearly half of what they needed in one day. This is a plausible answer as it is a common strategy used in bake sales to attract more customers and increase sales. Option B is not a plausible answer as the desire for new robes alone would not necessarily result in a significant increase in sales in just one day."}}
{"Q": "Jim is shocked when he gets an amazing deal on a house. Which event could cause Jim withdraws his offer and fires his real estate agent?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The house is full of moldy cheese. (B) he was being told a lie about the damage and forclouser.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Jim finds out that he was being lied to about the condition and foreclosure status of the house, it would be a valid reason for him to withdraw his offer and fire his real estate agent. This is a more plausible scenario than the house being full of moldy cheese, which is unlikely to happen and would not be a valid reason for withdrawing an offer."}}
{"Q": "Amy loved salad. Which event could cause Amy loved the salad so much she returned with friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She tried a Thai salad at a new restaurant. (B) Salad went to a store to get Amy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She tried a Thai salad at a new restaurant.\nExplanation: Trying a new type of salad at a restaurant and loving it enough to return with friends is a plausible event that could cause Amy to do so. On the other hand, the option of salad going to a store to get Amy is not a realistic event."}}
{"Q": "Fred is looking for ways to make his apartment feel more comfortable. Which event could cause He feels happy that he has improved how his apartment feels?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was thinking of selling cheap furniture and decorating it but then done in a trashy way. (B) Fred went to the store to get some new pictures.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Going to the store to get new pictures is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Fred is actively taking steps to improve the aesthetics of his apartment. Buying new pictures can add a personal touch and make the space feel more inviting, which could lead to Fred feeling happy and satisfied with the changes he has made. Option A suggests that Fred may have made poor choices in decorating his apartment, which would not necessarily lead to him feeling happy about the changes he has made."}}
{"Q": "Neil was touring haunted cities. Which event could cause He definitely thought Erie was haunted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Neil thought he met an interesting person in Erie, PA. (B) He didn't believe in ghosts till he saw one in Erie.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He didn't believe in ghosts till he saw one in Erie.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the topic of haunted cities and Neil's belief in ghosts. Meeting an interesting person in Erie may be a memorable experience, but it does not necessarily have anything to do with the city being haunted. However, seeing a ghost in Erie would definitely make Neil believe that the city is haunted."}}
{"Q": "Jim had a dog whom he loved very much. Which event could cause At last she was clean, and he promised never to let her be hurt again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim's dog ran into the backyard and had tons of fun. (B) One day, Jim's dog ran ahead during a walk and got stuck in a mud pit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) One day, Jim's dog ran ahead during a walk and got stuck in a mud pit.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it involves the dog getting dirty and potentially injured, which would prompt Jim to clean her up and promise to protect her from harm in the future. Running around in the backyard and having fun would not necessarily lead to the dog getting hurt or dirty, so it is less likely to be the cause of Jim's promise."}}
{"Q": "Jill was a very fashion conscious young girl. Which event could cause The drawing was so good, she was able to make a pattern out of it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jill showed her mom a picture of a dress she drew. (B) Jill drew something of a design.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If Jill drew something of a design, it is more likely that she would be able to make a pattern out of it. Drawing a picture of a dress may not necessarily involve designing the dress, and therefore may not result in a pattern."}}
{"Q": "One day Jordan had a friend over so they could play video games. Which event could cause Now when Jordan has a friend over, he makes sure they both play?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jordan's friend got bored when Jordan kept playing alone. (B) Jordan's friend wanted to take turns.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Jordan's friend got bored when Jordan kept playing alone.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jordan's friend got bored when Jordan kept playing alone, which prompted Jordan to make sure they both play together. If Jordan's friend wanted to take turns, it would not necessarily lead to Jordan making sure they both play together in the future."}}
{"Q": "Neil was visiting Romania. Which event could cause Neil decided to never return to Transylvania?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Neil's hotel was very dirty and unfriendly. (B) Neil lost his luggage in Kansas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Neil's hotel was very dirty and unfriendly.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a negative experience with accommodations would cause someone to not want to return to a certain place, rather than losing luggage in a completely unrelated location. Additionally, the fact that the hotel was both dirty and unfriendly suggests a particularly unpleasant experience that would leave a lasting impression on Neil."}}
{"Q": "A man went out early one morning. Which event could cause He resolved, next time, to check the day's overall forecast?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It started raining on the man. (B) It started raining and she didn't have an umbrella.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It started raining on the man.\nExplanation: If it started raining on the man, he may have been caught off guard and unprepared for the weather. This could lead him to resolve to check the day's overall forecast in the future to avoid being caught in the rain again. Option B mentions \"she\" which is not consistent with the given information about the man. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Joe went to the restaurant for wings. Which event could cause Joe got to finally enjoy his wings?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe ordered his favorite sushi at the restaurant. (B) Joe got lost on the way to the restaurant and it took him really long to find it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) Joe's order of wings finally arrived at his table.\nExplanation: This is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to Joe's purpose of going to the restaurant - to enjoy wings. Option A is not relevant as Joe did not order sushi, and option B is unlikely to affect Joe's enjoyment of his wings once he finally arrives at the restaurant."}}
{"Q": "Emily had a paper due for class. Which event could cause The next day, Emily's paper was not done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Emily planned to pull an all-nighter but fell asleep. (B) Emily refused to go to a party and instead worked on it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Emily planned to pull an all-nighter but fell asleep.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Emily had planned to stay up all night to finish her paper but ended up falling asleep due to exhaustion or other factors. It is less likely that she would refuse to go to a party and work on her paper instead, as this shows a high level of dedication and responsibility that may not be typical of all students."}}
{"Q": "Tim had a problem. Which event could cause He was so amazed at the sight that he was no longer scared?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim then got headphones to help with his hearing. (B) Tim was scared to go to the new school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Seeing something incredible or awe-inspiring.\nExplanation: It is more likely that witnessing something amazing or breathtaking would cause Tim to forget his fear and be amazed, rather than getting headphones to help with his hearing or being scared to go to a new school. Seeing something incredible can be a powerful experience that can temporarily override other emotions."}}
{"Q": "Nina was at the skating rink. Which event could cause Luckily, the girl left?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A teacher from Nina's school was also at the rink. (B) Her biggest rival tried to start a fight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Her biggest rival tried to start a fight.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause Nina to leave the skating rink because it involves a potential physical altercation with someone she has a conflict with. It is understandable that she would want to avoid any confrontation or danger and leave the situation. On the other hand, the presence of a teacher from her school may not necessarily be a negative or threatening event that would cause her to leave."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy needed a new pair of pants. Which event could cause Jimmy bought the pants he wanted?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jimmy had a jar of coins he saved for years. (B) Jimmy decided to make himself a pair of pants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jimmy had a jar of coins he saved for years.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jimmy would buy the pants he wanted with money he had saved up rather than deciding to make them himself. While making pants is a possibility, it is less likely than Jimmy simply using his savings to purchase a new pair of pants."}}
{"Q": "Nancy was looking for a place to eat. Which event could cause They looked at her with a mean grin?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The only available table was full of Nancy's enemies. (B) She walked up to a local library where many girls were eating.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The only available table was full of Nancy's enemies.\nExplanation: If Nancy's enemies were occupying the only available table at the restaurant, it is plausible that they would look at her with a mean grin. This could be due to past conflicts or simply because they do not like her. On the other hand, walking up to a local library where many girls were eating does not necessarily warrant a mean grin from strangers. It is more likely that they would simply look at her curiously or ignore her altogether."}}
{"Q": "Andy always helped his Dad plant trees. Which event could cause The tree reminds Andy of his Dad?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Andy planted a tree. (B) Andy's dad never passed away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Andy planted a tree.\nExplanation: When Andy plants a tree, it becomes a physical reminder of the times he spent with his dad planting trees. The act of planting a tree together was a shared experience between Andy and his dad, and seeing the tree grow and thrive can bring back memories of those times. On the other hand, option B is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any connection to the tree reminding Andy of his dad."}}
{"Q": "Tina and Mark were looking for a new house. Which event could cause I feel sorry for the builder they hired?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They decided to have it built to random specifications. (B) Tina and Mark had many wild ideas, so the decided to build a house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Tina and Mark decided to have their house built to random specifications, it would be difficult for the builder to meet their expectations and could lead to frustration and dissatisfaction on both sides. This could cause the builder to feel sorry for taking on the project. On the other hand, having many wild ideas is not necessarily a bad thing as long as they can be incorporated into the design and construction process."}}
{"Q": "Tim had a pet frog. Which event could cause Tim buried his frog that day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim's frog got eaten by a dog. (B) Unfortunately Tim's frog passed away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Unfortunately Tim's frog passed away.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is common for pets to pass away due to natural causes or illness. It is unlikely for a dog to eat a pet frog, as frogs are not a typical prey for dogs. Therefore, it is more likely that Tim buried his frog because it had passed away."}}
{"Q": "Chad's stomach began to rumble. Which event could cause Chad ate it all and got sick?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Chad ate a funny-tasting insect. (B) He had only just started eating his food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Chad ate a funny-tasting insect.\nExplanation: Eating a funny-tasting insect could cause Chad to get sick as it may contain harmful toxins or bacteria. On the other hand, if Chad had only just started eating his food, it is less likely to cause him to eat it all and get sick."}}
{"Q": "Briana was at the lake with her friend's family. Which event could cause Luckily, the next day they found cell service nearby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Briana couldn't call anyone. (B) None of the family had a phone charger.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Briana couldn't call anyone.\nExplanation: If Briana couldn't call anyone, it would make sense that they would be relieved to find cell service nearby the next day. On the other hand, the fact that none of the family had a phone charger wouldn't necessarily have an impact on their ability to make calls if they already had a charged phone. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My parents enjoy going to the casino. Which event could cause Ever since I leave the gambling to my parents?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I lost lots of money gambling. (B) I went with them many times and won $100.00.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If the speaker lost lots of money gambling, it would be a logical reason for them to stop going to the casino and leave it to their parents. Winning $100.00 (option B) would not necessarily cause the speaker to stop going to the casino, and may even encourage them to continue."}}
{"Q": "A friend and I were walking through a wooded area. Which event could cause I threw it back down and we ran away?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I picked up a rock with hieroglyphics on it. (B) We picked up a snake because we thought it was a stick.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. We picked up a snake because we thought it was a stick.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because picking up a snake, especially if you thought it was a harmless stick, could cause a sudden and fearful reaction. It is common for people to mistake snakes for sticks, and if the snake was venomous or aggressive, it would be a natural response to throw it down and run away. On the other hand, finding a rock with hieroglyphics on it may be interesting or curious, but it is unlikely to cause a sudden and fearful reaction."}}
{"Q": "Michael ordered a pepperoni pizza. Which event could cause While on the phone, his wife said that he opened the box backwards?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Michael accepted the pizza but it never arrived. (B) Michael accepted the pizza when it arrived.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Michael accepted the pizza when it arrived.\n\nExplanation: If Michael accepted the pizza when it arrived, it is plausible that he opened the box backwards while on the phone with his wife. This could have happened if he was distracted by the phone call and not paying attention to how he was opening the box. On the other hand, if Michael accepted the pizza but it never arrived, it would not be possible for him to open the box backwards since he never received the pizza."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy grew up very poor. Which event could cause So he repaid them for college?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A family offered Jimmy to pay his tuition. (B) He took out a loan for school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A family offered Jimmy to pay his tuition.\nExplanation: Given that Jimmy grew up very poor, it is unlikely that he would have been able to afford to take out a loan for college. Therefore, it is more plausible that a family offered to pay his tuition, and in gratitude, Jimmy repaid them for their kindness."}}
{"Q": "Will was driving to his college. Which event could cause The person threw food and trash at Will's car?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Will stopped and picked up a hitchhiker. (B) Will double parked at his college.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Will double parked at his college.\nExplanation: Double parking can be a frustrating experience for other drivers who are trying to find a parking spot. It is possible that someone became angry with Will for double parking and decided to throw food and trash at his car as a form of retaliation. On the other hand, picking up a hitchhiker is unlikely to cause someone to throw food and trash at Will's car."}}
{"Q": "A caterpillar was crawling along a wall. Which event could cause He placed the caterpillar on a nearby tree?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A man found the caterpillar. (B) He wanted to kill the caterpillar.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A man found the caterpillar.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man found the caterpillar and decided to place it on a nearby tree to ensure its safety or to observe it in its natural habitat. It is unlikely that someone who wanted to kill the caterpillar would bother to move it to a different location."}}
{"Q": "I drove my motorcycle across the street. Which event could cause I cleaned my motorcycle after I got home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The tree i parked under dripped sap on it. (B) I drove my motorcycle through the car wash, splashing soap all over my motorcycle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the tree under which the motorcycle was parked dripped sap on it, as this is a common occurrence and can cause damage to the motorcycle's paint and finish. Driving through a car wash and splashing soap all over the motorcycle is less likely, as it requires a deliberate action and may not be necessary after a short trip across the street."}}
{"Q": "Kim got a bike for her birthday. Which event could cause To her horror her bike was gone and the chain was on the gate?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kim locked her bike to the gate with a chain and watched it. (B) Kim forgot to lock her new bike up to a gate at school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Kim forgot to lock her new bike up to a gate at school.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because Kim may have been in a rush or simply forgot to lock her bike up properly. It is not uncommon for bikes to be stolen when they are left unsecured, especially in public places like schools. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Kim would have locked her bike to the gate and watched it, only to have it stolen later."}}
{"Q": "I found my old yearbook today while cleaning. Which event could cause The day was almost over and I hadn't cleaned anything?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I became lost in a huge world of fond memories. (B) I kept looking through things to see what else I could find while I cleaned.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) I became lost in a huge world of fond memories.\nExplanation: While going through the yearbook, the person may have become engrossed in looking at old photos and reminiscing about past memories. This could have caused them to lose track of time and neglect their cleaning duties, resulting in the day almost being over without any cleaning being done. Option (B) suggests that the person was intentionally procrastinating and looking for distractions, which may not be as likely as getting lost in nostalgia while looking through old yearbooks."}}
{"Q": "Michelle had a huge stack of books. Which event could cause Then she went home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Michelle organized the books in her room. (B) She decided to donate them to the library.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She decided to donate them to the library.\nExplanation: If Michelle decided to donate her books to the library, it would make sense for her to leave and take the books with her. Organizing the books in her room would not necessarily require her to leave, and it is not a strong enough reason for her to do so. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kelly decided to have a golf tournament with her friend. Which event could cause Kelly couldn't wait to beat her again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly scored much higher than her friend on the SAT. (B) Kelly lead the entire competition.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Kelly lead the entire competition.\nExplanation: Since Kelly is having a golf tournament with her friend, it is more likely that she would be excited to beat her friend in the tournament. Option B suggests that Kelly was leading the competition, which means she was doing well and had a chance to win. Therefore, it is more plausible that Kelly couldn't wait to beat her friend again if she was leading the tournament. Option A is not related to the golf tournament and does not provide any context for Kelly's excitement to beat her friend."}}
{"Q": "Harry was making some spaghetti. Which event could cause A few minutes later they saw that the colander had melted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Harry used a metal colander. (B) Henry failed at it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Harry used a metal colander, it could have melted due to the high heat of the boiling water. Metal has a lower melting point than the boiling point of water, so it is possible for the colander to melt if it is left in the pot for too long. On the other hand, Henry failing at making spaghetti would not necessarily cause the colander to melt."}}
{"Q": "Gina had a crush on Jamie and Josh. Which event could cause Gina wasn't sure if it was good advice, or sabotage?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gina's friend said she should talk to both. (B) Gina's friend told her to tell them both the combination at the same time, and let them fight over her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it suggests that Gina's friend is giving her bad advice that could potentially harm her relationships with Jamie and Josh. Telling them both the combination and letting them fight over her is not a healthy or respectful way to approach a romantic situation. It could lead to hurt feelings, jealousy, and even physical altercations. Therefore, it makes sense that Gina would be unsure if this advice is good or if it could sabotage her chances with both Jamie and Josh. Option A, on the other hand, is a more neutral suggestion that could go either way depending on the context and Gina's feelings towards talking to both of them."}}
{"Q": "Jason was the second string quarterback at his school. Which event could cause The coach decided to replace the star quarterback with Jason?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jason made a great play. (B) Jason made a terrible play.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jason made a great play.\nExplanation: If Jason made a great play, it would show the coach that he has the potential to perform well and could be a better option than the current star quarterback. On the other hand, if Jason made a terrible play, it would not be a good reason to replace the star quarterback as it would show that Jason is not ready to take on the role."}}
{"Q": "I only intended to work at my aunt's dentistry office for a summer. Which event could cause Now I am a dentist working in her office?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Instead, it became my kryptonite. (B) I fell in love with the field over time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I fell in love with the field over time.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the individual developed an interest in dentistry and decided to pursue it as a career after working at their aunt's office for a summer. This is a common occurrence where individuals discover their passion for a field while working in it. Option (A) is less likely as kryptonite refers to something that weakens or destroys a person, which does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Mitch wanted to learn how to play the piano. Which event could cause After 3 months, Mitch was able to afford his piano lessons?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mitch took a part time job after school. (B) Mitch took a piano lessons after school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mitch took a part time job after school.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mitch was able to afford his piano lessons after taking a part time job, as piano lessons can be expensive and require regular payments. Taking piano lessons alone would not necessarily provide Mitch with the financial means to continue paying for lessons for three months. However, a part time job would provide him with a steady income to cover the cost of the lessons."}}
{"Q": "Gina's family stopped for gas on a road trip. Which event could cause She exited the car, and walked across the cold parking lot?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she decided to stretch her legs and get some fresh air. (B) Gina finally arrived at home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. she decided to stretch her legs and get some fresh air.\nExplanation: It is common for people to stop and stretch their legs during a long road trip. Gina's decision to exit the car and walk across the parking lot suggests that she wanted to take a break from sitting in the car and get some fresh air. Option B, Gina finally arriving at home, does not make sense in the context of the sentence as it is stated that they stopped for gas on a road trip, implying that they were still on the road and had not yet reached their destination."}}
{"Q": "Neil was visiting Romania. Which event could cause Neil enjoyed visiting Transylvania?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Neil didn't want to go to Transylvania. (B) The hotel and its staff where the extremely friendly and help.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The historical and cultural attractions in Transylvania were interesting to Neil.\nExplanation: Transylvania is known for its rich history and cultural heritage, including medieval castles, Gothic architecture, and folklore associated with vampires and Dracula. It is a popular tourist destination for those interested in exploring these aspects of Romanian culture. Therefore, it is likely that Neil enjoyed visiting Transylvania for these reasons. Option A is not a plausible answer as it contradicts the premise that Neil was visiting Transylvania. Option B is also not a relevant answer as it does not relate to the specific question about why Neil enjoyed visiting Transylvania."}}
{"Q": "Jim was extremely bored on Sunday. Which event could cause He decided to got to the Star Trek convention?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim read about a Star Wars convention. (B) He had heard about some local events.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He had heard about some local events.\nExplanation: If Jim was extremely bored on Sunday, it is more plausible that he would have heard about some local events happening in his area rather than randomly stumbling upon information about a Star Trek convention. Additionally, the fact that he decided to attend the convention suggests that he had some interest in Star Trek, which would make it more likely that he would attend a convention related to that franchise if he knew about it."}}
{"Q": "Louise had a pop quiz in science class. Which event could cause She got a bad grade on it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Louise did not have time to study. (B) Louise studied the night before.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Louise did not have time to study.\nExplanation: If Louise did not have time to study, it is more likely that she would get a bad grade on the pop quiz. Without sufficient preparation, it would be difficult for her to answer the questions correctly. On the other hand, if she studied the night before, she would have had some time to review the material and increase her chances of doing well on the quiz. However, it is still possible that she may not have studied effectively or may have encountered unexpected questions on the quiz, leading to a bad grade."}}
{"Q": "My son was a painter. Which event could cause My son was happy and our relationship grew stronger?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I told my artist I supported his dream of becoming a professional son. (B) My son painted the house for free.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I told my artist I supported his dream of becoming a professional son.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it shows that the parent is supportive of their child's career aspirations, which can lead to increased happiness and a stronger relationship. Painting the house for free may also be a kind gesture, but it does not necessarily have the same impact on the parent-child relationship as showing support for their career goals."}}
{"Q": "Maria went swimming into in the ocean. Which event could cause Neal dived in the water to get her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She got swept away by a small current. (B) Maria went in too far and needed help.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) She got swept away by a small current.\n\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because currents in the ocean can be unpredictable and strong, even in seemingly calm waters. If Maria got caught in a current and was being pulled away from shore, Neal would need to dive in to rescue her. On the other hand, if Maria simply went in too far and needed help, it is more likely that she could have just swam back to shore on her own or with the help of a lifeguard."}}
{"Q": "Karen, Ashley, and Beth were very excited. Which event could cause When Mommy came home, she was sure to be very surprised?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Karen, Ashley, and Beth had refused to clean up the house for their mom. (B) Karen, Ashley, and Beth made their mom a cake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Karen, Ashley, and Beth made their mom a cake.\nExplanation: Making a cake for their mom is a positive and thoughtful gesture that would likely surprise and please her. Refusing to clean up the house would not be a pleasant surprise for their mom."}}
{"Q": "When I was sixteen I learned to drive. Which event could cause After that mistake, I became much more cautious?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wasn't paying attention and I got into an accident. (B) I stopped a red light, but got into a car accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Getting into an accident while driving is a common experience that can cause someone to become more cautious. In this scenario, the mistake of not paying attention while driving and getting into an accident would likely lead to the individual becoming more cautious in the future. Stopping at a red light and getting into an accident is less likely to cause someone to become more cautious, as stopping at a red light is a responsible driving behavior."}}
{"Q": "Amanda recently took a trip to the zoo. Which event could cause Amanda really enjoyed the zoo, but she will never forget the anaconda?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The anaconda was 400 feet long. (B) Amanda saw everything there.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The anaconda was 400 feet long.\nExplanation: Seeing an anaconda that is 400 feet long would be an incredibly memorable experience, as it would be an impossible size for any real anaconda. This event is also more specific and unique than simply seeing everything at the zoo, making it a more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "Gina's friends all had Lisa Frank Trapper Keepers. Which event could cause She didn't want to ruin the design, so she didn't use the pencils?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her enemies all colored on their Trapper Keepers. (B) After school, Gina's dad surprised her with one, too.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) After school, Gina's dad surprised her with one, too.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it provides a logical reason for Gina to not want to use her pencils on her Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper. If she had just received one as a gift, she would want to keep it in pristine condition and not risk ruining the design by using pencils on it. On the other hand, the idea that her enemies colored on their Trapper Keepers seems less likely to be the reason why Gina didn't use her pencils."}}
{"Q": "Randy was very shy and never talked much at school. Which event could cause Frank and Randy became good friends through their shyness?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Frank was also very shy. (B) One day Randy met Frank who was deaf too.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Frank was also very shy.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that two shy individuals would bond over their shared trait of shyness. If Frank was also shy, he may have been more understanding and patient with Randy's shyness, which could have led to a friendship. On the other hand, meeting someone who is deaf may not necessarily lead to a friendship based solely on shyness."}}
{"Q": "Jennifer was trying to get some lunch. Which event could cause Unfortunately, almost everything was already gone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jennifer was the first person at the food truck. (B) She was running late from class.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She was running late from class.\nExplanation: If Jennifer was running late from class, it is more likely that other people had already gotten their lunch before her, causing some of the food to be sold out. If she was the first person at the food truck, it is less likely that everything would be gone already."}}
{"Q": "Kathy was driving her car on the highway. Which event could cause She wondered after that if it was worth swerving in the first place?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She wasn't able to avoid hitting the car. (B) The next car hit and killed the animal Kathy avoided.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The next car hit and killed the animal Kathy avoided.\nExplanation: If Kathy swerved to avoid hitting an animal and the next car hit and killed the same animal, she may wonder if it was worth swerving in the first place. This is because she put herself in danger by swerving and potentially causing an accident, but the animal still ended up getting hit."}}
{"Q": "Sam couldn't wait to show off his science fair project at school. Which event could cause They were a very attentive audience?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He made a presentation. (B) Sam was too nervous to tell the audience about his project.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He made a presentation.\nExplanation: If Sam made a presentation, it implies that he had the opportunity to explain his project to the audience. If he did a good job presenting, the audience would have been attentive and interested in what he had to say. On the other hand, if Sam was too nervous to tell the audience about his project, it is unlikely that the audience would have been very attentive."}}
{"Q": "Don was always moving slow. Which event could cause He never walked slowly again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Someone ran into Don from behind. (B) Don went to the doctor and got eye drops.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If someone ran into Don from behind, it could cause him to fall or injure himself, which could result in him never walking slowly again. On the other hand, getting eye drops from the doctor would not have any direct impact on Don's walking speed."}}
{"Q": "Dan was working diligently at his desk. Which event could cause He thanked her and was happy to have found his lost appliance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan received a call from someone who found his dog that he lost on the way to work. (B) A lady approached Dan and asked if this was his PDA. It was.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Dan would be happy and thankful to have found his lost appliance, which in this case is his PDA, rather than his lost dog. The scenario of a lady approaching him and returning his lost PDA is also more likely to happen in a workplace setting."}}
{"Q": "When my daughter was 8 months old we put her into a walker. Which event could cause She cried for awhile but recovered quickly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I tipped the walker over when trying to walk. (B) Sometimes she would fall down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sometimes she would fall down.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the baby cried for a while but recovered quickly after falling down while using the walker, as this is a common occurrence for babies learning to use walkers. Tipping the walker over while trying to walk could cause a more serious injury and would be less likely for the baby to recover quickly from."}}
{"Q": "Alex's phone got dropped in the toilet and died. Which event could cause Finally, she settled on the new iPhone and purchased it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) so she went to the mall to find a new one. (B) Alex searched the hay stack for a new phone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alex would go to a mall or electronics store to find a new phone, rather than searching through a haystack. Additionally, the fact that her phone died in the toilet suggests that she would need a replacement quickly, making a trip to the mall a more practical option."}}
{"Q": "Jordan and Alex were on a camping trip. Which event could cause Then she bought them a new tent?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jordan and Alex's tent was hit and a hole was created. (B) Jordan had a new tent.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Jordan and Alex's tent was hit and a hole was created.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the need for a new tent arose due to an unexpected event, such as the tent being damaged. Option (B) suggests that Jordan already had a new tent, which would make the purchase unnecessary. Therefore, option (A) is a more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "Tim had just learned how to used the telephone at home. Which event could cause Tim already went back to playing with his toys as his mother returned?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim couldn't find the phone. (B) Tim's mom told him never to use the phone without her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tim couldn't find the phone.\n\nExplanation: If Tim couldn't find the phone, he wouldn't be able to use it and would likely go back to playing with his toys. On the other hand, if Tim's mom told him never to use the phone without her, he would still remember the rule and wouldn't use the phone even if his mother wasn't around. However, it's important to note that there could be other events that could cause Tim to go back to playing with his toys, such as getting bored or losing interest in using the phone."}}
{"Q": "Kim's mother tricked her into eating deer meat. Which event could cause Kim continued to yell as her mother walked out of the room?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kim gave her mother a huge kiss. (B) Kim hated eating animals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Kim hated eating animals.\nExplanation: If Kim hated eating animals, then being tricked into eating deer meat would likely cause her to feel upset and angry. This could lead to her yelling as her mother walked out of the room, expressing her frustration and disappointment. On the other hand, if Kim gave her mother a huge kiss, it would suggest that she was happy with what her mother had done, which is not consistent with the scenario presented."}}
{"Q": "Tracy had a crush on a boy. Which event could cause Tracy became embarrassed because she looked silly in many of them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The boy knew it, and looked up pictures of Tracy on her Facebook page. (B) The boy jerked off to tracy's pictures.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The boy knew it, and looked up pictures of Tracy on her Facebook page.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy finding pictures of Tracy on her Facebook page would cause her embarrassment, as it is a common occurrence for people to search for information about someone they have a crush on. On the other hand, it is inappropriate and disrespectful for someone to masturbate to someone else's pictures without their consent, and it is unlikely that Tracy would know about it."}}
{"Q": "Ted loves to go to the movies. Which event could cause Ted continues to watch several movies a week?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Watching movies gave Ted a lot of ideas of writing. (B) Ted have enough money to watch movies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: If Ted has enough money to watch movies, he can continue to watch several movies a week without any financial constraints. On the other hand, if watching movies gave Ted a lot of ideas of writing, it may inspire him to write but it doesn't necessarily mean he will continue to watch several movies a week. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It was the summer break. Which event could cause It was the first time Gina had been to that part of town?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina and her friends decided to explore an amusement park. (B) Gina and her friends decided to explore the city.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Gina and her friends decided to explore the city.\nExplanation: Exploring a city is a common activity during summer break, especially for teenagers who want to try new things and have fun. It is more plausible that Gina and her friends would decide to explore the city rather than an amusement park, which would require more planning and preparation. Additionally, exploring the city would give Gina the opportunity to visit new neighborhoods and parts of town that she may not have been to before."}}
{"Q": "Jack loves walking to the Marathon. Which event could cause Shortly after arriving, the rain stopped and they walked home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It started raining while he was walking. (B) Jack had to walk in the sun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) It started raining while he was walking.\nExplanation: If it started raining while Jack was walking to the Marathon, it is plausible that the rain stopped shortly after he arrived and he walked home. This scenario fits with the statement that Jack loves walking to the Marathon, implying that he would not mind walking in the rain. On the other hand, option (B) does not make sense as it contradicts the fact that it rained and Jack had to walk home."}}
{"Q": "I stopped my car at the traffic light. Which event could cause Alas, he crashed his car and I realized street racing is bad?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A guy came next to me and stole his engine to race me. (B) Another car gave me a street racing signal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Another car gave me a street racing signal.\nExplanation: If another car gave a street racing signal, it could have tempted the driver to engage in street racing, leading to a potential accident. This scenario is more plausible than someone stealing the engine of the car, which is highly unlikely to happen at a traffic light."}}
{"Q": "Early one morning I could hear my dogs. Which event could cause They almost knocked me over on the way out, just to chase a cat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Earl was barking at a squirrel. (B) There was an orange cat at the back door.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There was an orange cat at the back door.\nExplanation: Dogs are known to have a strong prey drive and are often triggered by the sight or smell of a small animal like a cat. It is more plausible that the dogs were excitedly chasing a cat rather than just barking at a squirrel."}}
{"Q": "The pilot felt a shake in the plane. Which event could cause He tried to fix it but in the end he hand to eject?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plane kept moving around. (B) The plane was at a standstill.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The plane kept moving around.\nExplanation: If the pilot felt a shake in the plane and tried to fix it, it is more likely that the plane was moving around and experiencing turbulence or mechanical issues. If the plane was at a standstill, there would be no reason for the pilot to eject. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Beth wanted to give her mom a great present for Christmas. Which event could cause She knitted her mom a warm homemade sweater for free?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Beth found a box of yarn while cleaning her attic. (B) Beth had money so she decided to make something.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Beth found a box of yarn while cleaning her attic.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Beth used materials she already had on hand, rather than spending money on supplies. It also shows that Beth put effort and thought into the gift by taking the time to knit a sweater, rather than just buying something. Additionally, finding the box of yarn while cleaning her attic could have been a serendipitous moment that inspired Beth to create something special for her mom."}}
{"Q": "Dan wanted to find the perfect gift for his mother's birthday. Which event could cause Dan yelled at his mom for being picky?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) had time to play. (B) He bought her a necklace and she did not like it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He bought her a necklace and she did not like it.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because Dan is trying to find the perfect gift for his mother's birthday, and if she doesn't like the gift he bought her, he may become frustrated and yell at her for being picky. In contrast, having time to play does not seem related to Dan's search for the perfect gift or his potential frustration with his mother's pickiness."}}
{"Q": "It started to rainy when we got in the car. Which event could cause I rear ended the car in front of me?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Visibility was greatly reduced but I drove on anyway. (B) I saw out of the window with windshield wipers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If visibility was greatly reduced due to heavy rain, it would be more plausible that the driver would have difficulty seeing the car in front of them and could potentially rear-end it. Driving on despite poor visibility is a common cause of accidents in rainy conditions. On the other hand, using windshield wipers would improve visibility and reduce the likelihood of an accident."}}
{"Q": "Jenna came home from school and found a box on the porch. Which event could cause Jenna immediately regretted her decision to open the box?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jenna was excited and opened the box. (B) Jenna found some graphic objects in the trash.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Jenna found some graphic objects in the box, it could be something disturbing or inappropriate that she did not want to see. This could cause her to immediately regret her decision to open the box. On the other hand, if Jenna was excited and opened the box, there is no reason for her to regret her decision unless she found something unpleasant inside."}}
{"Q": "Ted loved rodents. Which event could cause The rat got out of it's cage, and it crawled into his parent's bed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ted tried to pet one, but was careless. (B) One night Ted left the rat's cage open on purpose.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) One night Ted left the rat's cage open on purpose.\nExplanation: If Ted intentionally left the rat's cage open, it is more likely that the rat would escape and crawl into his parent's bed. On the other hand, if Ted was careless while trying to pet the rat, it is less likely that the rat would end up in his parent's bed."}}
{"Q": "Dan was hungry. Which event could cause Dan returned to the couch and watched a movie with his snack?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan went to the kitchen and got a glass of water. (B) Dan made some popcorn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Dan made some popcorn.\nExplanation: If Dan was hungry, it is more likely that he would make a snack like popcorn rather than just getting a glass of water. Popcorn is a common snack to have while watching a movie, which is also mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, it is more plausible that Dan made some popcorn and returned to the couch to watch a movie with his snack."}}
{"Q": "The cat chased the mouse across the empty warehouse. Which event could cause The mouse got away?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cat tripped over its feet and hit its head on the floor. (B) far from home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The cat tripped over its feet and hit its head on the floor.\nExplanation: If the cat tripped and hit its head, it would likely be stunned or injured, giving the mouse an opportunity to escape. Option B, \"far from home,\" does not provide a logical reason for the mouse to get away from the cat."}}
{"Q": "Anna left her purse on the bus one evening. Which event could cause Anna was so happy, she hugged him eagerly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna found a man's purse. (B) A man found Anna's purse.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. A man found Anna's purse.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anna would be happy and grateful if someone found and returned her lost purse, rather than her finding someone else's purse. Therefore, option B is the more likely event that would cause Anna to hug the person who found her purse."}}
{"Q": "Gina and her sister sat on the porch waiting for their dad. Which event could cause She gave him a quick hug and hopped in the car?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their mom's boyfriend arrived first. (B) when their dad showed up they were excited.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) when their dad showed up they were excited.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the sentence states that Gina and her sister were waiting for their dad, so it makes sense that they would be excited and give him a quick hug when he arrived. Option (A) about their mom's boyfriend arriving first is not mentioned in the sentence and seems unrelated to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Laura decided to fly all the way to New York City. Which event could cause The compliments she got made Laura think the trip was worth it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She packed her old torn clothes. (B) Laura got many compliments while in NYC.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Laura got many compliments while in NYC.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Laura would feel that her trip was worth it if she received many compliments while in NYC. This would indicate that she had a positive experience and that people appreciated her presence and appearance. Packing old torn clothes would not necessarily affect her overall experience or perception of the trip."}}
{"Q": "Trisha was excited about letting someone live in their house. Which event could cause Years later the guys still lives there and Trisha wonders can he move?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They decided to shelter multiple college students. (B) The guys thought Trisha was only moving in short term.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The guys thought Trisha was only moving in short term.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because it suggests that the guy who is still living in Trisha's house years later may have assumed that Trisha was only temporarily moving out and would eventually return. Therefore, he may not have made any plans to move out himself. On the other hand, option (A) suggests that Trisha had planned to shelter multiple college students from the beginning, which would have made it clear to the guy that his stay was only temporary."}}
{"Q": "Edgar had just come home from the grocery store. Which event could cause Later, he went to the store and bought more eggs?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Edgar made cookies and cake. (B) Edgar dropped the bag with the meat on the floor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Edgar dropped the bag with the meat on the floor.\n\nExplanation: If Edgar dropped the bag with the meat on the floor, it is possible that the eggs in the bag were also damaged or broken. Therefore, he may have needed to go back to the store to buy more eggs. On the other hand, making cookies and cake does not necessarily require more eggs, as the recipe may only call for a specific amount."}}
{"Q": "Keith wanted to be a photographer. Which event could cause He was so excited?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Keiths parents bought him a new camera for Christmas. (B) Keith got excited for his birthday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Keith's parents buying him a new camera for Christmas would be a more plausible event to cause excitement for someone who wants to be a photographer. A new camera would allow Keith to practice and improve his photography skills, which would be exciting for someone who is passionate about photography. While birthdays can be exciting, it is less likely that Keith's excitement would be solely related to his birthday if his goal is to become a photographer."}}
{"Q": "Yan was walking in public to a restaurant. Which event could cause He immediately realized that his zipper was wide open?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Yan noticed stared at his pants. (B) Everyone looked at him and started laughing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Yan noticed stared at his pants.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Yan would notice his open zipper by himself rather than everyone else noticing it and laughing. It is a common occurrence for people to check their appearance before going out in public, and Yan may have noticed his open zipper during this routine check. Additionally, if everyone else noticed and started laughing, it would be a very embarrassing and uncomfortable situation for Yan, which is less likely to happen in a public setting."}}
{"Q": "Lori's class was supposed to be dissecting frogs. Which event could cause She picked up a knife and started dissecting the frog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lori's class didn't take dissection serious. (B) Lori's teacher confuse a frog on her desk with an instruction booklet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lori's class didn't take dissection serious.\nExplanation: If Lori's class didn't take dissection seriously, it's possible that Lori may have picked up a knife and started dissecting the frog without proper instruction or guidance from her teacher. This behavior would be reckless and dangerous, but it's more plausible than the scenario in which Lori's teacher confuses a frog with an instruction booklet."}}
{"Q": "As a child, And always hated reptiles. Which event could cause Now, And loves reptiles and even owns a snake and pet lizard?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) And's class had a pet snake he learned to really fear reptiles. (B) They worked in a reptile pet store as an intern.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They worked in a reptile pet store as an intern.\n\nExplanation: Working in a reptile pet store as an intern would expose And to reptiles on a daily basis, allowing them to become more familiar and comfortable with them. This experience could have led to a change in attitude towards reptiles, ultimately resulting in And owning a snake and pet lizard. On the other hand, simply having a pet snake in class and learning to fear reptiles may have reinforced And's dislike for them."}}
{"Q": "I was eating on my patio. Which event could cause So, I threw a butter knife at it and it flew away?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A bee landed on my food. (B) I tried to share my food with a bird.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A bee landed on my food.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a bee landed on the food and the person threw the butter knife to scare it away. It is not very likely that someone would throw a butter knife at a bird just for trying to share their food. Additionally, throwing a knife at a bird could harm or injure the animal."}}
{"Q": "The driver's lined up in the starting grid. Which event could cause They came across the line together, a photo finish?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Me and my friends ran separately. (B) The race was very even.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The race was very even.\nExplanation: If the race was very even, it means that the drivers were closely matched in terms of speed and skill. This could lead to a situation where they cross the finish line at almost the same time, resulting in a photo finish. On the other hand, if the drivers were not evenly matched, one driver would likely finish ahead of the others, making a photo finish unlikely. Choice (A) about the speaker and their friends running separately is unrelated to the scenario described in the question."}}
{"Q": "Timmy got a check in the mail for his birthday. Which event could cause They cashed his check and Timmy took his money home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Timmy went to the bank. (B) Timmy's check bounced.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Timmy went to the bank.\nExplanation: If Timmy received a check in the mail, the most plausible event that would result in him cashing the check and taking the money home would be him going to the bank to deposit or cash the check. Option B, Timmy's check bouncing, would not result in him taking the money home as the check would not be honored by the bank."}}
{"Q": "One day my teacher allowed us to dismiss 30 seconds before the bell. Which event could cause She pointed and laughed as I picked myself up off the floor?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I tried to run, but stumbled upon a backpack. (B) I ran past the teacher and almost tripped.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If the event was that the student tried to run but stumbled upon a backpack, it would be more likely that the teacher would feel concerned or ask if the student was okay rather than pointing and laughing. However, if the student ran past the teacher and almost tripped, it could be seen as a comical moment and the teacher may have found it amusing, leading to her pointing and laughing."}}
{"Q": "As a child, Andy had many toys. Which event could cause As an adult, Andy opened a toy museum and shared his love with others?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He loved throwing away all different types. (B) Andy continued to love toys as he got older.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Andy continued to love toys as he got older.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Andy's love for toys continued into adulthood and inspired him to open a toy museum to share his passion with others. If he had loved throwing away toys as a child, it is unlikely that he would have developed a deep appreciation for them later in life."}}
{"Q": "Gary tripped on a football player's shoe. Which event could cause Gary ended up with a bruised face?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gary almost landed hard and face first. (B) Gary got hit by the football player.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Gary almost landed hard and face first.\nExplanation: If Gary tripped on a football player's shoe, it is more likely that he stumbled and almost fell face first, causing a bruise on his face. It is less likely that he got hit by the football player, as this would require a separate action or event."}}
{"Q": "Amy and Ben had been together for one month. Which event could cause He gave her chocolates, she gave him skittles?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They decided to give each other money. (B) The exchanged gifts on their anniversary.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The exchanged gifts on their anniversary.\nExplanation: Since they had only been together for one month, it is unlikely that they would exchange gifts on an anniversary. However, it is common for couples to exchange gifts on special occasions such as anniversaries, birthdays, or holidays. Therefore, it is more plausible that they exchanged gifts on a special occasion rather than deciding to give each other money randomly."}}
{"Q": "We went to the beach today. Which event could cause We had a lot of fun building our sand castle?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We all swam in the lake and then played in the mud for a while. (B) We used ocean water and sand for construction.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) We used ocean water and sand for construction.\nExplanation: Building a sand castle requires sand and water, and since the statement mentions going to the beach, it is more plausible that they used ocean water and sand to build the sand castle. Swimming in the lake and playing in the mud do not necessarily relate to building a sand castle."}}
{"Q": "Anthony, 23, checked craigslist for local piano instructors. Which event could cause But who Anthony thought was her brother was really her husband?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anthony was attracted to his new piano teacher. (B) Anthony saw it was his sister's brother.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Anthony saw it was his sister's brother.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is a case of mistaken identity, which can happen easily. It is unlikely that Anthony's attraction to his new piano teacher would lead to him mistaking her husband for her brother."}}
{"Q": "I bought a house with an ugly yard Which event could cause He carved the rock into a lion head and kept it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There was a large rock in the yard. (B) I decided to tear the whole notebook up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There was a large rock in the yard.\nExplanation: If there was a large rock in the yard, it is possible that the new homeowner decided to turn it into a decorative feature by carving it into a lion head and keeping it. On the other hand, tearing up a notebook has no connection to the yard or the rock, making option B an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ric loved his dogs, and took them everywhere he went. Which event could cause He often gently dusts their ash canisters in somber reflection?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ric's dogs lived long, happy lives, but like all living things, eventually passed away. (B) Ric's cats passed away last month; he misses them so.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ric's dogs lived long, happy lives, but like all living things, eventually passed away.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the sentence mentions that Ric loved his dogs and took them everywhere he went, indicating a strong bond between them. The fact that he gently dusts their ash canisters in somber reflection suggests that they have passed away and he is paying tribute to them. Option B, which mentions Ric's cats passing away, is not as plausible because the sentence only talks about Ric's love for his dogs and does not mention any cats."}}
{"Q": "Tara wanted to find a new hobby. Which event could cause She enjoyed her thriving business?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she decided to start a children's clothes business. (B) Tara opened a can of tuna.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) she decided to start a children's clothes business.\nExplanation: Since Tara enjoyed her thriving business, it is more plausible that she would want to start a new business venture rather than randomly opening a can of tuna. Starting a children's clothes business could be a logical next step for her, as it would allow her to use her business skills and potentially tap into a new market."}}
{"Q": "In the first police interrogation Ike was very confused. Which event could cause Ike decided to stop talking and wait until he could get a lawyer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ike said some things that could be incriminating. (B) Ike decided to confess.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ike said some things that could be incriminating.\n\nExplanation: During the first police interrogation, Ike was confused and may have said things that could be used against him in court. Realizing this, he may have decided to stop talking and wait until he could get a lawyer to protect his rights and ensure that he did not incriminate himself further. Confessing would not be a plausible reason for Ike to stop talking, as it would only further incriminate him."}}
{"Q": "Daisy was at her middle school graduation. Which event could cause She decided to forget about it, and went home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Daisy dropped a bow on her graduation outfit. (B) she lost her hat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Daisy dropped a bow on her graduation outfit.\nExplanation: Dropping a bow on her graduation outfit may cause Daisy to feel embarrassed or self-conscious, which could lead her to want to forget about the event and go home. Losing her hat, while inconvenient, is unlikely to be a significant enough event to cause her to leave her graduation ceremony."}}
{"Q": "Ben had an exam coming up the next day. Which event could cause The next day, Ben failed his exam?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben decided to go to sleep early instead of studying. (B) Ben did not study.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If Ben did not study for his exam, it is more likely that he would fail the exam the next day. While going to sleep early instead of studying may not have been the best decision, it does not necessarily guarantee that he would fail the exam. However, not studying at all would greatly decrease his chances of doing well on the exam."}}
{"Q": "My cell phone lanyard broke on Wednesday. Which event could cause My wife was able to repair the lanyard, so I did not have to buy one?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I couldn't afford to replace my lanyard. (B) I showed it to my wife.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I showed it to my wife.\nExplanation: Since the lanyard was repaired by the wife, it is more plausible that the husband showed it to her and she was able to fix it, rather than the husband not being able to afford a replacement."}}
{"Q": "Kyle had made a pair of wheels to help his injured cat move around. Which event could cause It made Kyle happy to help out two animals who needed it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He continued making wheels for other injured animals. (B) Kyle helped two more cats with the same injuries.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Since Kyle was happy to help his injured cat move around with the wheels he made, it is likely that he would continue making wheels for other injured animals. This would give him a sense of satisfaction and purpose in helping animals in need. Helping two more cats with the same injuries would also make him happy, but it is less likely to be the event that caused his happiness in the first place."}}
{"Q": "Alice lived with her parents. Which event could cause She was put on restriction when her father caught her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice did live up to her parent's rules. (B) Alice kept stealing money from her parents.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Alice kept stealing money from her parents.\n\nExplanation: If Alice was caught stealing money from her parents, it would be a valid reason for her to be put on restriction. This behavior would go against her parents' rules and could result in consequences such as being grounded or having privileges taken away. On the other hand, choice (A) suggests that Alice simply didn't follow her parents' rules, but it doesn't specify any particular action that would warrant being put on restriction. Therefore, (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Al couldn't hear anything out of his new headphones. Which event could cause They told Al that the headphone jack was turned off?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Al called customer support. (B) The employee's complained to Al.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The employee's complained to Al.\nExplanation: If Al couldn't hear anything out of his new headphones, it is likely that he would try to troubleshoot the issue himself. However, if he was unable to find a solution, he may have sought help from the employees. The employees may have noticed that the headphone jack was turned off and informed Al of this, which would have resolved the issue. On the other hand, it is less likely that Al would have called customer support for this issue, as it is a simple fix that can be resolved in-store."}}
{"Q": "Jenny wanted to know why the water was red. Which event could cause Inside she found a severed human hand?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jenny went to investigate the water supply. (B) Jenny closed the bag in the water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jenny went to investigate the water supply.\nExplanation: If Jenny went to investigate the water supply, she would have been able to see the water and notice that it was red. This would prompt her to investigate further and potentially find the severed human hand inside the bag. On the other hand, closing the bag in the water would not necessarily explain why the water was red or how a severed human hand ended up in the bag. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Carla's old Doctor switched practices and she needed to get a new one. Which event could cause She liked her a lot?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Carla's old Doctor found a new landlord. (B) Carla's old doctor saw her on Tuesday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Carla's old Doctor found a new landlord.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible as it suggests that Carla's old doctor had to move to a new location and may no longer be practicing in the same area. This would require Carla to find a new doctor, even if she liked her old one. On the other hand, option B is not a likely cause for Carla needing to find a new doctor as seeing her on Tuesday does not necessarily indicate any change in the doctor's practice or availability."}}
{"Q": "Ted loves to go to the movies. Which event could cause He decides to stop watching movies?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) All the movie theaters near Ted raised their prices until Ted couldn't afford to go to the movies. (B) All of the movie theaters dropped their prices and gave away tickets to people who couldn't afford to go to the movies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If all the movie theaters near Ted raised their prices until he couldn't afford to go to the movies, it would be a plausible reason for him to stop watching movies. This would be a financial constraint that would prevent him from enjoying his favorite activity. On the other hand, if all the movie theaters dropped their prices and gave away tickets to people who couldn't afford to go to the movies, it would not be a reason for Ted to stop watching movies. In fact, it would make it easier and more affordable for him to continue going to the movies."}}
{"Q": "Melissa's boss decided to throw a holiday party. Which event could cause She was overjoyed when she got many compliments on her decorations?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Melissa's boss was responsible for decorations. (B) The boss went out and bought many decorations and decorated the office.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Melissa's boss was responsible for decorations.\nExplanation: If Melissa's boss was responsible for decorations, it is likely that Melissa would have put in a lot of effort and creativity into decorating the office. Therefore, if she received many compliments on her decorations, she would feel overjoyed and proud of her work. On the other hand, if the boss went out and bought many decorations and decorated the office, Melissa may not have had as much involvement in the process and may not have felt as personally invested in the decorations."}}
{"Q": "Kevin wanted to learn a totally new skill. Which event could cause In the end, he took up learning karate because of its intensity?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kevin tried learning how to cook but it wasn't satisfying enough. (B) Kevin decided on learning karate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If Kevin tried learning how to cook but found it unsatisfying, it is plausible that he would look for a new skill to learn. Karate's intensity may have appealed to him as a way to challenge himself and learn something new. Option B simply states that Kevin decided on learning karate without any context or reason, making it less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Tim was at home with his mom. Which event could cause Tim was silent for the rest of the night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They got into an apartment. (B) Tim's Mom had a migraine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) They got into an argument.\nExplanation: If Tim and his mom got into an argument, it could cause Tim to be silent for the rest of the night as he may be upset or angry. On the other hand, if Tim's mom had a migraine, it may cause her to be quiet or rest, but it wouldn't necessarily affect Tim's behavior for the rest of the night."}}
{"Q": "Kelly's mom was running a bath for her. Which event could cause By the time her mother returned the tub was overflowing with bubbles?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her mom went to wash some dishes. (B) She forget to pour bubble bath into the water and left to get a brand new towel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She forget to pour bubble bath into the water and left to get a brand new towel.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because if Kelly's mom forgot to pour bubble bath into the water, the bubbles would continue to grow and overflow the tub. Additionally, it is reasonable for her to leave briefly to get a new towel, which would give the bubbles enough time to overflow. On the other hand, if her mom went to wash some dishes, it is less likely that the tub would overflow with bubbles in such a short amount of time."}}
{"Q": "Carl was walking down the street. Which event could cause Carl paid for gas with it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Carl had a wallet full of money and a full tank of gas. (B) Carl found a twenty and couldn't find who's it was.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Carl had a wallet full of money, he would most likely use that money to pay for gas instead of using a found twenty. Additionally, if he already had a full tank of gas, he would not need to pay for more gas. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer as it suggests that Carl needed to pay for gas and had the means to do so."}}
{"Q": "Jason's headphones haven't worked for many weeks. Which event could cause Jason is so happy to have a working pair of headphones?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jason took his headphones in for a repair. (B) Jason bought a new car.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jason took his headphones in for a repair.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jason would be happy to have a working pair of headphones if he had taken them in for a repair, as this would mean he was able to fix a problem that had been bothering him for weeks. Buying a new car would not necessarily have any impact on his headphones, so it is less likely to be the cause of his happiness in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Ted was in the cafeteria on campus having lunch. Which event could cause Ted saved her life?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ted heard gun shooting. Ted hid behind the counter. (B) Ted noticed a girl choking and gave her a sandwich.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Ted noticed a girl choking and gave her a sandwich.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it involves a direct action that Ted could take to save someone's life. If Ted heard gun shooting, hiding behind the counter may have kept him safe, but it wouldn't necessarily have saved anyone's life. On the other hand, if Ted noticed a girl choking and gave her a sandwich, he could have potentially saved her life by dislodging the food from her airway."}}
{"Q": "Walter had a strong disdain for the immigrant policies in his country. Which event could cause Walter was successfully voted into office?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Walter decided to run of mayor. (B) He decided to try and keep things the same so he ran for office.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Walter decided to run for mayor.\nExplanation: If Walter had a strong disdain for the immigrant policies in his country, it is likely that he would want to make a change and improve the policies. Running for office, specifically for the position of mayor, would give him the opportunity to make a difference and implement policies that align with his beliefs. Running to keep things the same would not align with his strong disdain for the current policies and would not likely result in a successful election."}}
{"Q": "Ever since he was little, Evan wanted a bright blue car. Which event could cause People waved at him when he drove by?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Evan bought a bright red car. (B) Evan decided to get a blue convertible.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Evan decided to get a blue convertible.\nExplanation: Since Evan always wanted a bright blue car, it is more plausible that he would choose to get a blue convertible rather than a bright red car. The convertible would also make him stand out more and attract attention, which could cause people to wave at him when he drives by."}}
{"Q": "My first day of high school was nerve wrecking. Which event could cause Their restless eyes, frightful shards of glass that seemed to cut me?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Everyone was staring at me. (B) I ran into a group of my friends in the hallway.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The description of \"restless eyes\" and \"frightful shards of glass\" suggests a feeling of being scrutinized and judged, which is more likely to be caused by everyone staring at the speaker rather than running into a group of friends."}}
{"Q": "Joe was helping his dad clear the woods in the back of their yard. Which event could cause Joe laughed about the experience?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The backyard was being used for for his sister's wedding ceremony. (B) They had a good time doing summersaults together.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They had a good time doing summersaults together.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe would laugh about a fun activity he did with his dad while clearing the woods, such as doing summersaults together, rather than the backyard being used for his sister's wedding ceremony. The latter event does not seem to have any humorous or amusing elements that would cause Joe to laugh."}}
{"Q": "Patrick was deeply interested in Irish history. Which event could cause Patrick decided that recent Irish history was too violent for him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Patrick learned about it. (B) Patrick was bored reading the Irish history he discovered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Patrick learned about it.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Patrick, being deeply interested in Irish history, would have continued to read and learn about it. However, if he discovered that recent Irish history was too violent for him, it could have caused him to lose interest or become disillusioned with the subject. This would be a more likely reason for him to decide that recent Irish history was too violent for him."}}
{"Q": "Gina wanted to keep the stray dog she found. Which event could cause There was nothing she could say to convince her mother?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gina took the dog and showed it to her mom. (B) Gina asked her mother, but she hates dogs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Gina's mother hates dogs, it is unlikely that she would change her mind even if Gina showed her the dog. Therefore, option B is a more plausible event that could cause Gina's mother to refuse to let her keep the stray dog."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to gather persimmons where the trees grow wild in the woods. Which event could cause I told him he had the \"persimmon pucker.?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fruits were sour when we ate them. (B) My friend picked some persimmons and gave some to me.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The fruits were sour when we ate them.\nExplanation: Persimmons are known for their astringent taste when they are not fully ripe. If the fruits were sour when the person ate them, it is likely that they were not fully ripe yet. Eating unripe persimmons can cause a sensation in the mouth known as the \"persimmon pucker,\" which is a dry, puckering feeling caused by the tannins in the fruit. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person experienced the persimmon pucker due to eating sour persimmons rather than receiving them from a friend."}}
{"Q": "Tina was sitting in her home. Which event could cause It turns out her neighbors were burning pizza next door?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tina heard the alarm of her neighbors smoke detector. (B) She quickly missed something awfully stinky.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tina heard the alarm of her neighbors smoke detector.\nExplanation: If Tina heard the alarm of her neighbor's smoke detector, it would be a clear indication that something was burning next door. On the other hand, missing something stinky could be caused by various reasons, and it may not necessarily be related to her neighbor's burning pizza. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My mom accused my girlfriend of stealing money from the safe. Which event could cause My girlfriend stole it since she slept with me last night?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I looked through my girlfriend's purse and found money. (B) My girlfriend was angry and left.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Looking through someone's purse without their permission is an invasion of privacy and not a respectful way to handle the situation. Additionally, just because someone slept with you does not mean they are incapable of stealing. However, finding money in their purse would be a more concrete piece of evidence that could support the accusation. It is important to approach the situation with respect and communicate openly with your girlfriend to try to understand what happened."}}
{"Q": "Tim was at a party Which event could cause He threw up and had to be taken home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim got sick from drinking. (B) Tim started dancing the funky chicken.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tim got sick from drinking.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tim got sick from drinking at the party, as excessive alcohol consumption can lead to vomiting and the need to be taken home. Dancing the funky chicken, on the other hand, is unlikely to cause someone to throw up and require assistance getting home."}}
{"Q": "Paul was a very tall man. Which event could cause All it ended up doing was hurting his back?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Paul wore a brace to support himself successfully. (B) Paul had to wash dishes in a very low sink.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Paul had to wash dishes in a very low sink.\nExplanation: Washing dishes in a low sink would require Paul to bend down for an extended period of time, which could put a strain on his back and potentially cause injury. Wearing a brace may provide support, but it would not necessarily prevent injury if Paul was in a position that put too much strain on his back. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ronald is afraid of being arrested. Which event could cause Because of prison food, Ronald decided to not break the law?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ronald wants to go back. (B) Ronald loved eating at the best restaurants in town.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Ronald wants to go back.\nExplanation: If Ronald had a bad experience with prison food, it could deter him from wanting to go back to prison. This fear of returning to prison could cause him to avoid breaking the law in the future. On the other hand, Ronald's love for eating at the best restaurants in town would not necessarily prevent him from breaking the law, as the desire for good food does not outweigh the fear of being arrested and going to prison. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Amy decided to purchase new furniture for her new apartment. Which event could cause Amy decided to purchase new furniture for only the living room?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) amy saw it was cheap furniture. (B) Amy went furniture shopping and was blown away by the prices.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Amy went furniture shopping and was blown away by the prices, she may have decided to only purchase furniture for the living room as it is the most frequently used room in the apartment and she may not have the budget to furnish the entire apartment at once. This is a more plausible reason than simply seeing cheap furniture, as the quality and style of the furniture may not meet her standards."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to become a model. Which event could cause I finally landed a job and became a model?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I worked hard to build my portfolio. (B) I went to art school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I worked hard to build my portfolio.\nExplanation: Building a strong portfolio is essential for aspiring models to showcase their skills and potential to potential employers. By working hard to create a diverse and impressive portfolio, a model can increase their chances of landing a job. While attending art school may provide valuable training and experience, it is not necessarily a requirement for becoming a successful model."}}
{"Q": "Last Saturday we went to dim sum in Chinatown. Which event could cause We still enjoyed the experience and left stuffed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Our favorite waiter was not there. (B) Our service was very slow and it took a while to get two dumplings..", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Our favorite waiter was not there.\nExplanation: The absence of a favorite waiter may be disappointing, but it is unlikely to significantly affect the quality of the food or the overall experience. On the other hand, slow service and long wait times for food can be frustrating and may detract from the enjoyment of the meal. Therefore, it is more plausible that the absence of a favorite waiter did not have a significant impact on the experience, and the group still enjoyed the food and left feeling satisfied."}}
{"Q": "The Smith's could not find their cat. Which event could cause The Smiths all cheered, and rushed to hug their cat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They looked all over and then it jumped out of a tree to its death. (B) They looked all over and then it jumped out of a cabinet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They looked all over and then it jumped out of a cabinet.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because the cat was found alive and well, and the Smiths were relieved and happy to have found it. In contrast, option (A) is unlikely as it involves the cat's death, which would not cause the Smiths to cheer and hug their pet."}}
{"Q": "Jake needed to pick his son up from soccer practice. Which event could cause His son resented him for it for a long time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jake forgot and his son had to wait alone for hours at football practice. (B) Jake left late and got caught in traffic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Forgetting to pick up his son from soccer practice and leaving him alone for hours is a more plausible event that could cause his son to resent him for a long time. This would be a significant breach of trust and responsibility, and the son may feel abandoned and neglected. Being late due to traffic is a common occurrence and may not have as severe consequences."}}
{"Q": "Since he was raised catholic , John would always go to church. Which event could cause They eventually got married and had the ceremony in that same church?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John met an atheist girl he liked. (B) John met a woman at church and fell in love with her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) John met a woman at church and fell in love with her.\nExplanation: Since John was raised Catholic and always went to church, it is more plausible that he would meet someone at church and fall in love with her. It is less likely that he would meet an atheist girl and have a Catholic wedding in the same church."}}
{"Q": "Darcy failed two classes in school. Which event could cause Soon Darcy was allowed to go out with her friends again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Darcy's parents punished her until she picked her grades up. (B) Darcy's parents kicked her out until she picked her grades up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Darcy's parents would punish her until she picked her grades up rather than kicking her out. Kicking her out would not necessarily help her improve her grades and could potentially cause more harm than good. Punishing her until she improves her grades shows that her parents care about her education and want her to succeed."}}
{"Q": "Jeff noticed that his speakers are not as loud as he liked. Which event could cause Now he is very happy with his speakers?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jeff bought a new stereo. (B) Jeff returned the speakers and bought new ones.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jeff bought a new stereo.\nExplanation: Buying a new stereo could potentially solve the issue of the speakers not being loud enough. The new stereo may have more power or better compatibility with the speakers, resulting in a better sound quality and increased volume. On the other hand, returning the speakers and buying new ones may not necessarily guarantee that Jeff will be happy with the new speakers, as there could be other factors affecting the sound quality. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Samuel loved reading old science fiction stories. Which event could cause Samuel could not read?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Samuel forgot his reading glasses. (B) Samuel forget his reading shovel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Samuel forgot his reading glasses.\nExplanation: If Samuel forgot his reading glasses, he would not be able to read the small print in the science fiction stories. Forgetting a reading shovel would not affect his ability to read."}}
{"Q": "Jenny was a singer and she was really talented. Which event could cause She declined reluctantly, and followed her hunch that it wasn't right?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A man invited Jenny to dinner. (B) Jenny got a rejection from a label.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jenny got a rejection from a label.\nExplanation: If Jenny received a rejection from a label, it could cause her to feel discouraged and question her talent. This could lead her to decline opportunities or follow her intuition that something isn't right. On the other hand, being invited to dinner by a man may not necessarily have a direct impact on her career or decision-making."}}
{"Q": "Lary was a poor coal miner. Which event could cause Lary was happy and excited?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lary enjoyed his job even though he was not good at it. (B) Larry came across a pile of coal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Larry came across a pile of coal.\nExplanation: As a coal miner, finding a pile of coal would mean that Lary would have a good chance of earning more money and improving his financial situation. This would make him happy and excited as it would provide him with some relief from his financial struggles. On the other hand, enjoying his job even though he was not good at it would not necessarily make him happy and excited, as he would still be struggling financially. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Rex had a pitbull puppy. Which event could cause So every night Rex was left cleaning trash and water masses?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rex got into the trash when his owner was sleeping. (B) Rex's puppy liked to clean up after itself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rex got into the trash when his owner was sleeping.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Rex got into the trash when his owner was sleeping, as dogs are known to be curious and may explore their surroundings when left unsupervised. It is unlikely that a puppy would clean up after itself, as this behavior is not typical for dogs. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Today I got a new green shirt. Which event could cause I decided to wear this shirt everyday to bring me more luck?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) so many horrible incidents happened while I wore it today. (B) My crush asked me out on a date today.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the positive experience of being asked out on a date by a crush would lead someone to want to wear the shirt again in hopes of bringing more luck. On the other hand, if many horrible incidents happened while wearing the shirt, it is unlikely that someone would want to continue wearing it."}}
{"Q": "Amber always thought she was the best tennis player on her team. Which event could cause Amber was disappointed that she lost to a new comer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) amber is tennis player so good for playing but positive negative is part of the life so one day playing bad so another new come from play. (B) She be saded against a new player.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Amber's disappointment at losing to a new comer suggests that she was not expecting to lose and had a high opinion of her own abilities. This event challenges her self-perception and could lead to feelings of disappointment and frustration. Option (A) is not a coherent sentence and does not provide a clear explanation for Amber's disappointment."}}
{"Q": "Tim is part of the school soccer team. Which event could cause Because of his good performance they won the game?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He failed the team on many occasions. (B) He led the team on many occasions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He led the team on many occasions.\nExplanation: If Tim led the team on many occasions, it means he played a significant role in the team's success. His good performance would have contributed to the team's victory, making it a plausible event that could cause them to win the game. On the other hand, if he failed the team on many occasions, it would be unlikely that his good performance alone would have been enough to secure a win."}}
{"Q": "Sal asked her friends over for a dinner party. Which event could cause Sal and her friends had a great time at their dinner party?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sal's friend came with more food and games. (B) Sal had to cancel because she had to work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Sal's friend came with more food and games.\nExplanation: This option suggests that there was an increase in the amount of food and entertainment available at the party, which could lead to a more enjoyable experience for Sal and her friends. It also implies that Sal's friend was thoughtful and considerate in bringing these items, which could contribute to a positive atmosphere and good vibes among the group. In contrast, option B suggests that the party did not happen at all, which would obviously not lead to a great time for anyone."}}
{"Q": "Tim's girlfriend Gina starts seeing a psychologist. Which event could cause Gina responds to his ultimatum by dumping him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim wanted Gina to do better at her job. (B) Tim said you need to stop seeing the psycologist or him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If Tim gives Gina an ultimatum to choose between him or seeing a psychologist, it is a clear sign of controlling behavior and lack of support for her mental health. This could cause Gina to feel trapped and unsupported, leading her to end the relationship. On the other hand, if Tim wanted Gina to do better at her job, it may cause some tension in the relationship, but it is unlikely to be a deal-breaker for Gina."}}
{"Q": "Samuel loved reading old science fiction stories. Which event could cause He loved it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He read the Star Wars extended universe material. (B) Samuel was gifted a science text book.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Reading the Star Wars extended universe material is a more plausible answer as it is directly related to science fiction stories. A science textbook may not necessarily contain science fiction stories and may not be as interesting to Samuel."}}
{"Q": "Clara used to be a very active person. Which event could cause Clara gave up and never got out of bed again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Clara fell down one day in the gym and broke her leg. (B) Clara developed an illness which caused her to exercise a lot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Clara developed an illness which caused her to exercise a lot.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that an illness that caused Clara to exercise excessively would lead to her giving up and never getting out of bed again. This could be due to fatigue, weakness, or other symptoms associated with the illness. On the other hand, breaking a leg is a temporary setback that can be treated and healed with time, and it is unlikely to cause someone to give up on being active permanently."}}
{"Q": "My baby has a favorite blanket. Which event could cause I better go to the store and get another one?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My adult started teething though and ruined the blanket. (B) I am going to need to wash the blanket soon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the baby's favorite blanket will need to be washed soon, as babies tend to drool, spit up, and have diaper leaks. Having a backup blanket on hand will ensure that the baby is not without their favorite comfort item while the original is being washed. While it is possible for an adult to accidentally damage the blanket, it is less likely than the need for washing."}}
{"Q": "Rodolfo was a reindeer herder. Which event could cause Then he took off into the skies with his reindeer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rodolfo trained to be Santa's apprentice. (B) Rodolfo rounded us all his sheep.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rodolfo trained to be Santa's apprentice.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rodolfo took off into the skies with his reindeer because he was training to be Santa's apprentice. Reindeer are commonly associated with Santa Claus and his sleigh, so it makes sense that Rodolfo would need to know how to fly them in order to assist Santa. On the other hand, rounding up sheep does not typically involve flying, so it is less likely that this event would lead to Rodolfo taking off into the skies with his reindeer."}}
{"Q": "Yesterday Lauren decided to go for a walk in the woods. Which event could cause Lauren shouted and soon her dad came running to rescue her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lauren found a snake on the trail. (B) Lauren fell and twisted her tongue.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lauren found a snake on the trail.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lauren would shout and need rescue if she encountered a snake on the trail, as snakes can be dangerous and frightening. Twisting her tongue, on the other hand, is not a common or serious injury that would require immediate rescue."}}
{"Q": "Marty saw the snow was falling down hard outside. Which event could cause When he took his gloves off, his ring went flying into the snow?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) In his excitement to touch the snow he ran outside and ripped his gloves off without thinking. (B) Marty put on gloves to stay inside.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If Marty was excited to touch the snow and ripped his gloves off without thinking, it is more likely that he was not being careful and his ring accidentally slipped off his finger. On the other hand, if he put on gloves to stay inside, it is less likely that he would take them off so quickly and carelessly, leading to the loss of his ring."}}
{"Q": "Jan checked into a hotel after a long business workshop. Which event could cause Then Jan saw the pot empty by the maker and coffee pooling around it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jan started the coffee machine and jumped into the shower. (B) Jan wanted to get some coffee in her room, but the machine didn't look like it was working.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: If Jan started the coffee machine and jumped into the shower, it is possible that she did not notice the pot was empty and did not have a chance to turn off the machine before leaving the room. This could cause the coffee to overflow and pool around the machine.
