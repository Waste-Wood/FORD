{"Q": "A revolving door is convenient for two direction travel, but it also serves as a security measure at a what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bank (B) library (C) department store (D) mall (E) new york", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A bank.\nExplanation: A revolving door at a bank serves as a security measure to control the flow of people entering and exiting the building. It helps to prevent unauthorized access and provides a controlled entry point for security personnel to monitor. Additionally, the revolving door design helps to prevent the entry of large objects, such as bags or carts, which could potentially contain weapons or other dangerous items. Therefore, a revolving door is a common feature in many bank buildings."}}
{"Q": "What do people aim to do at work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) complete job (B) learn from each other (C) kill animals (D) wear hats (E) talk to each other", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. complete job\nExplanation: The primary goal of most people at work is to complete their job responsibilities and tasks assigned to them. This helps them to achieve their targets, meet deadlines, and contribute to the success of the organization. While learning from each other and socializing with colleagues can be important aspects of work, they are not the primary objectives. Killing animals and wearing hats are not relevant to most job roles and are not appropriate answers."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find magazines along side many other printed works?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) doctor (B) bookstore (C) market (D) train station (E) mortuary", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Bookstore.\nExplanation: Bookstores typically carry a wide variety of printed works, including magazines, books, newspapers, and other reading materials. They are a common place for people to browse and purchase reading materials, making them a likely location for magazines to be found alongside other printed works. The other options, such as a doctor's office, market, train station, or mortuary, are less likely to carry a wide variety of reading materials, and may not be places where people typically go to browse or purchase magazines."}}
{"Q": "Where are  you likely to find a hamburger?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) fast food restaurant (B) pizza (C) ground up dead cows (D) mouth (E) cow carcus", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Fast food restaurant.\nExplanation: Hamburgers are a popular menu item at fast food restaurants such as McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's. These restaurants specialize in serving quick and convenient meals, including hamburgers, to customers on the go. While ground beef is a key ingredient in making a hamburger, it is not appropriate to refer to it as \"ground up dead cows\" or \"cow carcass.\""}}
{"Q": "James was looking for a good place to buy farmland.  Where might he look?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) midwest (B) countryside (C) estate (D) farming areas (E) illinois", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. farming areas\nExplanation: If James is looking to buy farmland, it would make sense for him to look in areas where farming is prevalent. These areas are typically referred to as farming areas and can be found throughout the country, not just in the Midwest or Illinois. The countryside and estates may also have farmland, but they are not as specific as farming areas."}}
{"Q": "What island country is ferret popular?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) own home (B) north carolina (C) great britain (D) hutch (E) outdoors", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Great Britain.\nExplanation: Ferrets are popular pets in Great Britain, where they are often kept in homes as indoor pets. They are also used for hunting rabbits and rodents in the countryside. While ferrets can be kept in outdoor hutches, they are more commonly kept as indoor pets in Great Britain."}}
{"Q": "In what Spanish speaking North American country can you get a great cup of coffee?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) mildred's coffee shop (B) mexico (C) diner (D) kitchen (E) canteen", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Mexico.\nExplanation: Mexico is a Spanish speaking North American country known for its high-quality coffee production. Mexican coffee is grown in several regions, including Chiapas, Veracruz, and Oaxaca, and is known for its rich flavor and smooth finish. Many coffee shops and cafes in Mexico serve delicious coffee, making it a great destination for coffee lovers. Mildred's coffee shop, diner, kitchen, and canteen are not specific to any country and do not necessarily guarantee a great cup of coffee."}}
{"Q": "What do animals do when an enemy is approaching?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) feel pleasure (B) procreate (C) pass water (D) listen to each other (E) sing", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Listen to each other.\n\nExplanation: When an enemy is approaching, animals often rely on their sense of hearing to detect any potential danger. They listen to each other's warning calls and signals to determine the direction and proximity of the threat. This helps them to coordinate their response and take appropriate action, such as fleeing or preparing to defend themselves. Therefore, listening to each other is a crucial survival strategy for many animals in the face of danger."}}
{"Q": "Reading newspaper one of many ways to practice your what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) literacy (B) knowing how to read (C) money (D) buying (E) money bank", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Reading newspaper is a great way to practice your literacy skills, which includes reading, writing, and comprehension. It helps to improve your vocabulary, grammar, and critical thinking abilities. Reading newspaper regularly can also keep you updated with current events and improve your general knowledge. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What do people typically do while playing guitar?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cry (B) hear sounds (C) singing (D) arthritis (E) making music", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. making music.\nExplanation: People typically play guitar to make music, whether it's for personal enjoyment or to perform for others. While some may cry or sing while playing, those are not the primary activities associated with playing guitar. Arthritis may be a concern for some guitar players, but it is not something that people typically do while playing guitar. Hearing sounds is also a given, but it is not an activity in itself."}}
{"Q": "What would vinyl be an odd thing to replace?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) pants (B) record albums (C) record store (D) cheese (E) wallpaper", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Vinyl would be an odd thing to replace cheese because vinyl is a synthetic material used for making records, while cheese is a dairy product. The two are not related in any way, making it an illogical choice for replacement."}}
{"Q": "If you want harmony, what is something you should try to do with the world?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) take time (B) make noise (C) make war (D) make peace (E) make haste", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) make peace\nExplanation: If you want harmony, the best course of action is to make peace with the world. This means resolving conflicts, promoting understanding, and working towards mutual benefit. Making noise or making war will only create more discord and disharmony, while taking time or making haste may not necessarily lead to peace. Therefore, making peace is the most plausible answer for achieving harmony."}}
{"Q": "Where does a heifer's master live?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) farm house (B) barnyard (C) stockyard (D) slaughter house (E) eat cake", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Farm house.\nExplanation: A heifer is a young female cow that is raised on a farm. Therefore, it is most likely that the heifer's master would live in a farm house, which is the main residence on a farm. The other options, such as barnyard, stockyard, and slaughterhouse, are not places where a farmer would typically live. \"Eat cake\" is not a relevant option."}}
{"Q": "Aside from water and nourishment what does your dog need?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) bone (B) charm (C) petted (D) lots of attention (E) walked", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. walked\nExplanation: Dogs need exercise and mental stimulation to stay healthy and happy. Regular walks provide both physical and mental stimulation for dogs, as they get to explore new sights, smells, and sounds. Walking also helps to prevent obesity, joint problems, and other health issues. Therefore, it is important to make sure your dog gets enough exercise by taking them for regular walks."}}
{"Q": "Janet was watching the film because she liked what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) erection (B) laughter (C) being entertained (D) fear (E) bordem", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. being entertained.\n\nExplanation: It is highly unlikely that Janet was watching the film because of an erection or fear. Laughter could be a reason, but it is not the most plausible answer. Being entertained is a common reason for watching a film, and it is the most likely reason in this case."}}
{"Q": "What are you waiting alongside with when you're in a reception area?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) motel (B) chair (C) hospital (D) people (E) hotels", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. People.\nExplanation: When you're in a reception area, you're typically waiting for someone or something. In the case of a motel or hotel, you may be waiting for a room to become available or for someone to check you in. In the case of a hospital, you may be waiting for a doctor or nurse to see you. However, regardless of the type of reception area, you will always be waiting alongside other people who are also waiting for something. Therefore, option D, people, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "When drinking booze what can you do to stay busy?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) reach tentative agreement (B) stay in bed (C) stop bicycle (D) examine thing (E) suicide", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) examine thing\nExplanation: When drinking alcohol, it is important to stay occupied and engaged in activities that do not involve further consumption of alcohol. Examining things around you, such as artwork, books, or even your surroundings, can help keep your mind occupied and prevent boredom or the temptation to drink more. It can also be a good opportunity to appreciate and learn more about your environment."}}
{"Q": "A fencing thrust with a sharp sword towards a person would result in what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) injury (B) small cuts (C) fever (D) competition (E) puncture wound", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. puncture wound.\n\nExplanation: A fencing thrust with a sharp sword towards a person is a deliberate attempt to pierce the opponent's body with the tip of the sword. This can result in a puncture wound, which is a deep and narrow wound caused by a sharp object penetrating the skin and underlying tissues. The severity of the injury depends on the force of the thrust, the location of the wound, and the type of sword used. In some cases, a fencing thrust can be fatal if it hits a vital organ or major blood vessel. Therefore, it is important to practice fencing with proper safety equipment and under the supervision of a trained instructor."}}
{"Q": "Unlike a spider and his many sight seers, people only have what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) tongues (B) names (C) brains (D) feelings (E) two eyes", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. brains\nExplanation: The sentence is comparing a spider, which has many sight seers (eyes), to people. The word \"only\" suggests that people have something less than a spider's many eyes. The only option that makes sense in this context is \"brains,\" as people have one brain that processes visual information from their two eyes. The other options, such as tongues, names, and feelings, are not relevant to the comparison being made."}}
{"Q": "Where do adults use glue sticks?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) classroom (B) desk drawer (C) at school (D) office (E) kitchen drawer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. office\nExplanation: While glue sticks can be used in a variety of settings, such as classrooms and schools, they are most commonly used in offices for tasks such as paper crafts, scrapbooking, and labeling. Therefore, it is more plausible that adults would use glue sticks in an office setting rather than in a classroom or kitchen drawer."}}
{"Q": "What could go on top of wood?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) lumberyard (B) synagogue (C) floor (D) carpet (E) hardware store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) carpet\nExplanation: Carpet is a common material that can be placed on top of wood flooring or subflooring to provide a soft and comfortable surface. Lumberyard and hardware store are places where wood and building materials are sold, while a synagogue is a place of worship and not typically associated with wood flooring. While wood can be used as flooring, it is not something that would go on top of wood. Therefore, (D) carpet is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The artist was sitting quietly pondering, then suddenly he began to paint when what struck him?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sadness (B) anxiety (C) inspiration (D) discomfort (E) insights", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. inspiration.\n\nExplanation: The word \"suddenly\" suggests that the artist was not actively painting before this moment. Additionally, the fact that the artist was \"pondering\" implies that they were deep in thought, possibly searching for an idea or inspiration. Therefore, it is most likely that the artist began to paint when they were struck by a sudden burst of inspiration."}}
{"Q": "Though the thin film seemed fragile, for it's intended purpose it was actually nearly what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) indestructible (B) durable (C) undestroyable (D) indestructible (E) unbreakable", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) durable\nExplanation: While the thin film may have appeared fragile, it was likely designed to withstand the specific conditions and stresses of its intended use. Therefore, it would be more accurate to describe it as durable, meaning it is able to withstand wear, pressure, or damage over time. Indestructible, undestroyable, and unbreakable all suggest that the film is completely impervious to damage, which is unlikely to be the case."}}
{"Q": "Where could you find a toilet that only friends can use?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) rest area (B) school (C) stadium (D) apartment (E) hospital", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. apartment\nExplanation: In some apartment buildings, there may be a communal bathroom or toilet that is only accessible to residents or their guests. This could be considered a toilet that only friends can use, as it is not open to the general public. Rest areas, schools, stadiums, and hospitals are all public places where anyone can use the restroom facilities."}}
{"Q": "What is someone who isn't clever, bright, or competent called?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) clumsy (B) ineffectual (C) dull (D) clumsy (E) stupid", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. dull\nExplanation: Someone who is not clever, bright, or competent can be described as dull, meaning lacking in interest or excitement, or lacking in sharpness or intensity. The other options, such as clumsy, ineffectual, and stupid, may imply different negative qualities, but do not necessarily capture the lack of intelligence or competence described in the question."}}
{"Q": "When wildlife reproduce we often refer to what comes out as what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) raise children (B) have children (C) photo copy (D) offspring (E) accidently got pregnant somehow", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Offspring.\nExplanation: Offspring is the correct term used to refer to the young ones produced by wildlife during reproduction. It is a more scientific and accurate term than the other options provided. The term \"raise children\" is more commonly used for human reproduction, while \"photo copy\" and \"accidentally got pregnant somehow\" are not appropriate or professional terms to use."}}
{"Q": "The weasel was becoming a problem, it kept getting into the chicken eggs kept in the what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) forrest (B) barn (C) public office (D) out of doors (E) freezer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) barn\nExplanation: The weasel is a common predator of chickens and their eggs. Therefore, it is likely that the chicken eggs were kept in a barn, which is a common place for chickens to be kept. The other options, such as a forest, public office, or freezer, are not plausible locations for chicken eggs to be kept."}}
{"Q": "Blue read material outside of his comfort zone because he wanted to gain what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) new perspective (B) entertained (C) understanding (D) hunger (E) tired eyes", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. new perspective.\nExplanation: Blue read material outside of his comfort zone because he wanted to gain a new perspective. Reading outside of one's comfort zone can expose them to new ideas, cultures, and experiences that they may not have encountered otherwise. This can broaden their understanding of the world and help them see things from different perspectives."}}
{"Q": "After he got hired he hoped for success at his what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) vocation (B) new job (C) michigan (D) working hard (E) manual", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. vocation\nExplanation: The word \"vocation\" refers to one's career or profession, which would make sense in the context of hoping for success after getting hired. The other options, such as \"Michigan\" and \"manual,\" do not fit logically in this sentence. \"New job\" could be a possible answer, but it is less specific than \"vocation.\""}}
{"Q": "Committing perjury is a serious what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) indictment (B) crime (C) violence (D) lie (E) go to jail", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. crime\nExplanation: Perjury is the act of lying under oath in a court of law or in a legal document. It is considered a crime because it undermines the integrity of the justice system and can lead to wrongful convictions or acquittals. Those who commit perjury can face fines, imprisonment, and other legal consequences."}}
{"Q": "If you are prone to postpone work what will you have to do in order to finish on time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) eat (B) hasten (C) antedate (D) bring forward (E) advance", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. hasten\nExplanation: If you are prone to postpone work, you will need to hasten in order to finish on time. Hastening means to do something quickly or to hurry up. This is the most plausible answer as it directly addresses the issue of procrastination and suggests a solution to complete the work on time. Eating, antedating, bringing forward, and advancing are not relevant or effective solutions to the problem of procrastination."}}
{"Q": "James wanted to find an old underground map from the 50s.  Where might he look for one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) library (B) subway station (C) county engineer's office (D) super market (E) home", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. library\nExplanation: The library is a more plausible option as it is a common place to find historical documents and maps. The county engineer's office may also have old maps, but it is less likely to be open to the public and may require special permission to access. The subway station and supermarket are unlikely to have old maps, and James' home is also an unlikely place to find an old underground map from the 50s."}}
{"Q": "Sean was in a rush to get home, but the light turned yellow and he was forced to do what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) take time (B) dawdle (C) go slowly (D) ocean (E) slow down", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. slow down\nExplanation: When the traffic light turns yellow, it is a signal for drivers to slow down and prepare to stop. Sean was forced to slow down because he couldn't make it through the intersection before the light turned red. This is a common scenario that drivers encounter on the road, and it is important to follow traffic signals to ensure safety for oneself and others."}}
{"Q": "Where would a person be doing when having to wait their turn?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) have patience (B) get in line (C) sing (D) stand in line (E) turn left", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) stand in line\nExplanation: When having to wait their turn, a person would typically stand in line, especially in situations such as waiting to order food, buy tickets, or board a plane. While having patience is important, it is not a physical action that a person would be doing while waiting in line. Singing or turning left are also not relevant actions in this context. Getting in line is similar to standing in line and could also be a plausible answer, but standing in line is a more commonly used phrase."}}
{"Q": "She was always helping at the senior center, it brought her what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) satisfaction (B) heart (C) feel better (D) pay (E) happiness", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. satisfaction\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the woman was always helping at the senior center, indicating that she found it fulfilling and rewarding. The word \"satisfaction\" best fits this context as it implies a sense of accomplishment and contentment from doing something meaningful. The other options, such as \"heart\" and \"feel better,\" are too vague and do not provide a clear indication of what the woman gained from helping at the senior center. \"Pay\" is also unlikely as the sentence does not mention any financial compensation, and \"happiness\" is too broad and does not necessarily capture the specific benefits that the woman may have experienced from her volunteer work."}}
{"Q": "The lock kept the steering wheel from moving, but the thief still took his chances and began to work on the what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) keep cloesd (B) train (C) ignition switch (D) drawer (E) firearm", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The lock mentioned in the question is most likely a steering wheel lock, which prevents the steering wheel from turning. However, it does not prevent someone from attempting to start the car by working on the ignition switch. Therefore, the thief in this scenario would likely begin to work on the ignition switch despite the steering wheel being locked. Choices A, B, D, and E are not relevant to the situation described in the question."}}
{"Q": "Who is a police officer likely to work for?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) beat (B) direct traffic (C) city (D) street (E) president", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. city\nExplanation: Police officers are typically employed by the city or municipality they serve in. They work for the local government and are responsible for maintaining law and order within their jurisdiction. While they may work on a beat or direct traffic as part of their duties, their ultimate employer is the city or town they serve."}}
{"Q": "If you have leftover cake, where would you put it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) quandry (B) refrigerator (C) oven (D) night stand (E) bakery", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. refrigerator\nExplanation: Leftover cake should be stored in the refrigerator to prevent it from spoiling. The cool temperature of the refrigerator will slow down the growth of bacteria and keep the cake fresh for a longer period of time. It is important to cover the cake with plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent it from drying out or absorbing any odors from other foods in the fridge."}}
{"Q": "A human wants to submerge himself in water, what should he use?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) whirlpool bath (B) coffee cup (C) cup (D) soft drink (E) puddle", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. whirlpool bath\nExplanation: A whirlpool bath is a large tub filled with water that has jets that create a swirling motion. This would be the most plausible option for someone who wants to submerge themselves in water as it is designed for that purpose and can accommodate a human body. The other options, such as a coffee cup, cup, soft drink, or puddle, are not suitable for submerging a human due to their small size and lack of depth."}}
{"Q": "Where is a doormat likely to be in front of?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) facade (B) front door (C) doorway (D) entrance porch (E) hallway", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. front door.\n\nExplanation: A doormat is typically placed in front of the front door of a house or building. It serves as a place for people to wipe their feet before entering, helping to keep the interior clean. While a doormat could potentially be placed in other locations such as a doorway or entrance porch, the most common and logical location is in front of the front door."}}
{"Q": "Bob the lizard lives in a warm place with lots of water.  Where does he probably live?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) rock (B) tropical rainforest (C) jazz club (D) new mexico (E) rocky places", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. tropical rainforest.\n\nExplanation: Bob the lizard is described as living in a warm place with lots of water. Tropical rainforests are known for their warm and humid climates, as well as their abundance of water sources such as rivers, streams, and rainfall. Lizards are also commonly found in tropical rainforests, making this the most plausible answer. The other choices, such as rocky places or New Mexico, do not necessarily fit the description of a warm place with lots of water. The jazz club is also an unlikely option as it is an indoor venue and not a natural habitat for lizards."}}
{"Q": "August needed  money because he was afraid that he'd be kicked out of his house.  What did he need money to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) control people (B) pay bills (C) hurt people (D) buy food (E) get things", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: August needed money to pay bills, specifically to avoid being kicked out of his house. This is a common reason why people need money, as housing is a basic necessity and failure to pay rent or mortgage can result in eviction or foreclosure. The other options (controlling people, hurting people, buying food, getting things) do not seem to be directly related to August's situation as described in the question."}}
{"Q": "He needed more information to fix it, so he consulted the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) chickens (B) google (C) newspaper (D) online (E) manual", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) online\nExplanation: In today's digital age, it is common for people to seek information and solutions online. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person in question consulted the internet for more information to fix the problem rather than consulting chickens, a newspaper, or a manual. Google is also a popular search engine that people use to find information online."}}
{"Q": "Where can you put a picture frame when it's not hung vertically?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) art show (B) wall (C) newspaper (D) car (E) table", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. table\nExplanation: When a picture frame is not hung vertically, it can be placed on a table or any flat surface. This is a common way to display picture frames, especially for smaller frames or frames with stand-backs. The other options, such as an art show, wall, newspaper, or car, are not practical or appropriate for displaying a picture frame that is not hung vertically."}}
{"Q": "James knew that he shouldn't have been buying beer for minors.  He didn't even get paid for it.  Why was this bad?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) lose money (B) fun (C) have no money (D) broken law (E) relaxation", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Buying beer for minors is illegal and can result in serious consequences, such as fines, legal charges, and even imprisonment. James could have faced legal repercussions for his actions, which is why it was a bad decision. The fact that he didn't get paid for it or that it may have been fun or relaxing does not justify breaking the law."}}
{"Q": "What is the result of applying for  job?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) anxiety and fear (B) increased workload (C) praise (D) less sleep (E) being employed", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. being employed\nExplanation: The result of applying for a job is typically the possibility of being offered employment. While there may be some anxiety and fear associated with the application process, and potentially increased workload if hired, the ultimate goal is to secure employment and begin working. Praise and less sleep are not typically direct results of applying for a job."}}
{"Q": "What must someone do before they shop?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) get money (B) have money (C) bring cash (D) go to market (E) bring cash", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Before someone can shop, they must have money to pay for the items they want to purchase. Therefore, the most plausible answer is to get money, which could mean withdrawing cash from an ATM or having enough funds available on a credit or debit card. While bringing cash is also a valid option, it is not always necessary as many stores now accept electronic forms of payment. Going to the market is not necessarily a prerequisite for shopping, as there are many different types of stores and shopping venues available."}}
{"Q": "Because John was first violin, he had to bring something important to work ever day. What did he need to bring to work?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) music store (B) obesity (C) symphony orchestra (D) ochestra (E) violin case", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. violin case\nExplanation: As John was the first violin in the symphony orchestra, it is likely that he needed to bring his violin case to work every day. The violin case would contain his instrument, bow, and possibly other accessories needed for his performance. The other options, such as a music store or obesity, do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What is a place that usually does not have an elevator and that sometimes has a telephone book?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) at hotel (B) kitchen (C) library (D) telephone booth (E) house", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Telephone booth.\nExplanation: Telephone booths are small structures that are usually found on the street or in public places. They are not typically equipped with elevators, as they are usually only one or two stories tall. Additionally, telephone booths often have a telephone book available for users to look up phone numbers. While some of the other options, such as a house or a library, may have a telephone book, they are much more likely to have an elevator."}}
{"Q": "Who is likely to be excited about a crab?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) fish market (B) pet shop (C) fishmongers (D) intertidal zone (E) obesity", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) fish market\n\nExplanation: A fish market is likely to be excited about a crab because crabs are a popular seafood item that is often sold in fish markets. Fish markets specialize in selling fresh seafood, including crabs, to customers who are looking for high-quality seafood products. Therefore, a fish market is the most plausible answer among the given choices."}}
{"Q": "Where can a human find clothes that aren't pants?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pants shop (B) on planet earth (C) dress shop (D) school (E) train wreck", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. dress shop\nExplanation: A dress shop is a store that specializes in selling dresses, skirts, blouses, and other clothing items that are not pants. While pants shops do exist, they primarily sell pants and other types of legwear. On planet earth, there are countless clothing stores that offer a variety of clothing options, including those that are not pants. School and train wreck are not relevant options for finding clothes that aren't pants."}}
{"Q": "If I was getting drunk, and people couldn't understand me, what might I be having?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) a seizure (B) slurred speech (C) death (D) forgetfulness (E) pass out", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) slurred speech\nExplanation: When someone is getting drunk, their speech can become slurred and difficult to understand.

While they may also be found in bodies of freshwater, they are more commonly associated with saltwater habitats.

This is because restaurants offer a variety of food options and the food is readily available. Making bread or cooking dinner requires time and effort, which may not be feasible when someone is hungry.

While there are certainly castles in other parts of the world, Europe's long and rich history has led to the construction of many more castles than any other continent. The other answer choices are not plausible as \"fairy tale\" is not a continent, Edinburgh is a city in Scotland, and Antarctica is a continent with no human population."}}

They are often bred specifically for research purposes and are not typically found in the wild or in domestic settings like a bell cat or countryside. While it is possible for mice to make their way into an attic or bush, it is unlikely that they would be exclusively white in color. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E. laboratory."}}

Therefore, if someone commits murder, they may be prevented from going to jail if they are successful in avoiding detection and prosecution. However, this is not a desirable outcome as it is illegal and morally wrong to take someone's life."}}

The stew pot is not a storage location, but it is where the crab meat would eventually end up for cooking. The other options, such as the wharf or tidepools, are not appropriate for storing uncooked crab meat as they are exposed to the elements and could spoil quickly. Red Lobster is a restaurant chain and not a storage location. The boss's office is also not a suitable place for storing food."}}

It is likely that the teens were trying to hide their drinking by walking straight and acting sober, but their staggering upon entering the door gave it away. The other options are less likely as getting arrested or vomiting would be extreme and noticeable, while falling down could happen for other reasons unrelated to drinking. Health is also too vague and does not necessarily indicate alcohol consumption."}}

Music stores may have a selection of wind instruments, but they are not typically played together in a group. Creating music may involve wind instruments, but it is not a public setting. Zoos do not typically have wind instruments on display or played together in a group.

The word \"effort\" implies that he is actively doing something, so (B) active is the most plausible answer. (A) restless and (E) hard work are possible, but not as directly supported by the information given. (C) lazybutt is not a real word and (D) productive is not necessarily implied by the information given."}}

The other options, such as a WWII bunker or a resort, are unlikely as they do not fit the context of the sentence. Las Vegas could be a possibility, but it is not specified in the sentence and may not be relevant to the story. A bed away from home is too general and does not provide enough information to answer the question. Therefore, the most logical answer is that he stayed in a hotel when he arrived at the city after a long trip from the farm."}}

Bridge.\nExplanation: Bridges are a common and practical way to cross canals. They provide a stable and safe passage for pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles. While barges are also used for transportation on canals, they are not a reliable means of crossing from one side to another. Michigan is a state in the United States and Amsterdam and Venice are cities known for their canals, but they do not provide a specific solution for crossing a canal. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D, bridge."}}

This force can sometimes result in the suspect getting hurt, either intentionally or unintentionally. However, it is not a valid excuse for police brutality, and officers who use excessive force can still be held accountable for their actions. The other options, such as committing perjury, prosecution, attack, or riot, may also be consequences of obstructing justice, but they are not directly related to police brutality."}}
{"Q": "While washing clothes they became what when caught on the sharp object?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) damaged (B) wet clothes (C) wear out (D) torn (E) have fun", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. torn.\n\nExplanation: When clothes get caught on a sharp object while washing, they are likely to get torn. This can result in irreparable damage to the fabric, making it difficult or impossible to wear the clothes again. Therefore, option D, torn, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Seafood restaurants are used to draw tourists where?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) maine (B) shoe shop (C) city (D) boston (E) coastal cities", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. coastal cities\nExplanation: Seafood restaurants are typically located in coastal cities where there is easy access to fresh seafood. These cities are often popular tourist destinations, making seafood restaurants a draw for visitors looking to experience local cuisine. Maine and Boston are both coastal cities, but \"coastal cities\" is a more general and inclusive answer that encompasses a wider range of potential locations. A shoe shop and a city are not specific enough to be plausible answers."}}
{"Q": "James's nice asked him about her grandfather. She was interested in learning about what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) family tree (B) family reunion (C) babysitting (D) brother's house (E) heirlooms", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. family tree\nExplanation: James's niece was interested in learning about her grandfather, which suggests that she wanted to know more about her family history and lineage. Therefore, the most plausible answer is family tree, as it would provide information about her grandfather's ancestors and relatives. The other options, such as family reunion, babysitting, brother's house, and heirlooms, do not seem relevant to the topic of learning about her grandfather."}}
{"Q": "James looked up and saw the start twinkling in the black yonder.  He marveled the sheer number of them and the size of what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) universe (B) orbit (C) night sky (D) outer space (E) his wallet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. universe\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"the sheer number of them\" which refers to the stars, and \"the size of\" something, which is likely referring to the vastness of the universe. The other options, such as orbit, night sky, outer space, and his wallet, do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What would encourage someone to continue playing tennis?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) becoming tired (B) tennis elbow (C) exercise (D) hunger (E) victory", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. exercise\nExplanation: Tennis is a physically demanding sport that requires a lot of movement and endurance. Regularly playing tennis can help improve overall fitness and health, which can be a motivating factor for someone to continue playing. Additionally, the social aspect of playing tennis with friends or in a league can also be a motivating factor. Becoming tired or experiencing tennis elbow would likely discourage someone from continuing to play, while hunger is not typically a factor in tennis motivation. Victory can be a motivating factor, but it is not always guaranteed and may not be the sole reason someone continues to play."}}
{"Q": "James found the sound relaxing.   It was so relaxing he almost did what despite his efforts?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) deep breathing (B) worried (C) fall asleep (D) invigorating (E) feeling good", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. fall asleep.\nExplanation: The sentence states that James found the sound relaxing to the point where he almost did something despite his efforts. The most plausible option from the given choices is falling asleep, as relaxing sounds often have a calming effect that can induce drowsiness. Deep breathing and feeling good are also possible, but they do not necessarily require effort to achieve. Worried and invigorating are unlikely options as they have the opposite effect of relaxation."}}
{"Q": "What regions of a town would you have found a dime store?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) commercial building (B) old movie (C) small neighborhood (D) past (E) mall", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. commercial building\nExplanation: Dime stores were typically located in commercial buildings in the downtown area of a town or city. These stores were known for selling a variety of inexpensive items such as toys, household goods, and clothing. They were popular in the mid-20th century but have largely been replaced by larger retail chains and online shopping."}}
{"Q": "Where might an unused chess set be stored?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) toy store (B) michigan (C) living room (D) attic (E) cupboard", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Attic.\nExplanation: An unused chess set is more likely to be stored in a place where it won't take up too much space and won't be in the way of everyday activities. The attic is a common storage area for items that are not frequently used but still need to be kept in good condition. A toy store or living room may have chess sets on display or in use, while Michigan is a state and not a storage location. A cupboard could also be a possible storage location, but it may not be large enough to accommodate a full-sized chess set."}}
{"Q": "james told his son to settle down and be careful.  There were many frogs mating in the area, and James didn't want his son to do what to them?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) wander (B) migrate (C) scare (D) disturb (E) agitate", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. disturb\nExplanation: James is warning his son to be careful because there are many frogs mating in the area. If his son were to disturb the frogs, it could disrupt their mating process and potentially harm them. Therefore, disturb is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A man wants air conditioning while we watches the game on Saturday, where will it likely be installed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) car (B) house (C) offices (D) park (E) movie theatre", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. house\nExplanation: It is most likely that the man would want air conditioning installed in his house, where he can comfortably watch the game on Saturday. Air conditioning in a car or park would not be practical, and it is unlikely that offices or movie theaters would be open for him to watch the game."}}
{"Q": "What could be playing a balailaika?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) movie dr (B) orchestra (C) music store (D) cat (E) symphony", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Orchestra.\nExplanation: A balailaika is a traditional Russian stringed instrument that is commonly played in orchestras that specialize in Russian or Eastern European music. While it is possible to hear a balailaika in a movie or music store, it is most likely to be played in an orchestra setting. A cat playing a balailaika is not a plausible answer as cats do not have the ability to play musical instruments. A symphony is also not a likely answer as a symphony is a large orchestra that typically includes a wide range of instruments, and a balailaika may not be featured prominently in a symphony performance."}}
{"Q": "Sailors drive many different types of boats, what type of boat involves their namesake.", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) coming home (B) row boat (C) board ship (D) inflatable raft (E) sail boat", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Sail boat.\nExplanation: Sailors are named after the type of boat they operate, which is a sail boat.

{"Q": "Where could a person avoid the rain?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bus stop (B) tunnel (C) synagogue (D) fairy tale (E) street corner", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. tunnel\nExplanation: A tunnel provides shelter from the rain as it is covered and protects a person from getting wet. A bus stop or street corner may have a roof, but the sides are open, and rain can still come in from the sides. A synagogue may have a roof, but it is not a place where one can just go to avoid the rain without a valid reason. Fairy tale is not a physical place and cannot provide shelter from the rain."}}
{"Q": "Why would a person like to have a large house?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) have choice (B) mentally challenged (C) own house (D) obesity (E) lots of space", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Have choice.\nExplanation: A person may like to have a large house because it provides them with more choices. With more space, they can have more rooms for different purposes, such as a home office, a gym, or a guest room. They can also have more storage space and more outdoor space for activities. Having a large house gives them the freedom to design and use the space in a way that suits their lifestyle and preferences."}}
{"Q": "Where will a cheap book be found?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bookstore (B) classroom (C) discount store (D) school room (E) bedside table", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. discount store\nExplanation: Discount stores often offer lower prices on books compared to traditional bookstores. They may have overstocked or slightly damaged books that they sell at a discounted price. Classrooms and school rooms may have textbooks, but these are often not considered \"cheap\" due to their high cost. A bedside table may have a book, but it is unlikely to be a cheap one unless it was purchased from a discount store or secondhand."}}

They bought two tickets to the Falcons vs the Jets even though neither wanted to see the what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) internet cafe (B) sporting event (C) pressing wrong buttons (D) obesity (E) hockey game", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. sporting event\nExplanation: Since John and James bought tickets to the Falcons vs the Jets, it is clear that they wanted to attend a sporting event. The other options (internet cafe, pressing wrong buttons, obesity, and hockey game) do not make sense in the context of buying tickets to a specific sports game."}}
{"Q": "James noticed that his penis was bigger. .  How might he act toward his plastic surgeon?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) accidental (B) detestable (C) effusive (D) enabled (E) apathetic", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. effusive\nExplanation: If James noticed that his penis was bigger after a plastic surgery procedure, he might act effusive towards his plastic surgeon, expressing gratitude and excitement about the results. This is a more plausible answer as it is common for patients to express positive emotions towards their plastic surgeons after a successful procedure."}}
{"Q": "Who do professors work with?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) methods of facts (B) teach courses (C) wear wrinkled tweed jackets (D) school students (E) state facts", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. School students.\nExplanation: Professors typically work with students at the university or college level, teaching courses and conducting research. While they may use methods of facts and state facts in their work, these are not the primary groups or activities that they work with. The stereotype of professors wearing wrinkled tweed jackets is also not relevant to their work."}}
{"Q": "Colorful anemone look somewhat like what object you find on window sills?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) intertidal zone (B) coral sea (C) under water (D) flower bed (E) florida keys", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Flower bed.\n\nExplanation: Colorful anemones are often found in shallow waters and have a flower-like appearance, with tentacles resembling petals. This makes them look somewhat like flowers you might find in a flower bed. While anemones can also be found in the intertidal zone, coral sea, under water, and the Florida Keys, the comparison to a flower bed seems the most fitting."}}
{"Q": "From where do aliens arrive?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) outer space (B) weekly world news (C) roswell (D) universe (E) mars", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) universe.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that aliens could arrive from other planets or star systems within our own universe, rather than from a specific location like Roswell or Mars. The vastness of the universe and the possibility of other habitable planets make it a more likely source for extraterrestrial life."}}
{"Q": "The hikers stopped to have a drink, simply put they what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) had a party (B) were thirsty (C) refreshment (D) getting drunk (E) celebrating", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. were thirsty.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the hikers stopped to have a drink, which implies that they were feeling thirsty and needed to quench their thirst. The other options such as having a party, getting drunk, or celebrating are not supported by the given information and are unlikely scenarios. Refreshment could be a possible option, but it is too general and does not provide a clear explanation of why the hikers stopped. Therefore, option B, were thirsty, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "When you get up in the morning before you begin work you should do what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) apply for job (B) sleep (C) concentrate (D) shower (E) just do", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Shower.\nExplanation: Taking a shower in the morning can help you feel refreshed and ready to start your day. It can also help you feel more awake and alert, which can improve your productivity and concentration at work. Additionally, it can help you present yourself professionally if you have any video calls or in-person meetings. Applying for a job or sleeping are not relevant to starting your workday, and just doing something without a plan or purpose may not be productive. Concentrating is important, but it is not a specific action to take before starting work."}}
{"Q": "The kitten had nothing to dig it's claws into, so when it tried to stop it slid across what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) living room (B) floor (C) warm place (D) carpet (E) farmhouse", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. carpet.\nExplanation: Carpet is a common household flooring material that is often used in living rooms and other areas where people spend a lot of time. It is also a material that cats and kittens can easily dig their claws into, which makes it a likely choice for the surface that the kitten in the question slid across. The other options, such as a warm place or a farmhouse, do not provide enough context to make them plausible choices for the answer."}}
{"Q": "If a person is trying to keep something in their hand what should they do?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) complete collection (B) own house (C) procrastinate (D) explode (E) have to hold", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. have to hold\nExplanation: If a person is trying to keep something in their hand, the most plausible answer would be to have to hold it. This means that the person needs to physically grasp and hold onto the object to keep it in their hand. The other options, such as completing a collection, owning a house, procrastinating, or exploding, do not relate to the action of holding onto an object."}}
{"Q": "Where could you find hundreds of thousands of home?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) field (B) neighborhood (C) star can (D) city or town (E) apartment building", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. city or town.\nExplanation: Cities and towns are typically populated with hundreds of thousands of homes, ranging from single-family houses to apartment buildings. Fields and star cans are not typically places where homes are found, and while neighborhoods may have many homes, it is unlikely that any one neighborhood would have hundreds of thousands."}}

It is important for players to take proper precautions and safety measures to minimize the risk of injury."}}
{"Q": "If I want to watch a movie without leaving my home what might I use?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) drive in movie (B) drive in movie (C) television (D) video store (E) show", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. television.\nExplanation: If someone wants to watch a movie without leaving their home, the most plausible option would be to use a television. With the availability of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, people can easily access a wide range of movies and TV shows from the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, cable and satellite TV providers offer on-demand movie options as well. The other options listed, such as a drive-in movie or video store, require leaving the home and physically going to a location to watch a movie."}}
{"Q": "The victim was to take stand today, they were going to do what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) testify (B) runaway (C) witness (D) tell truth (E) go home", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. testify\nExplanation: When a victim takes the stand, it means they are going to testify in court. Testifying is the act of giving evidence or making a statement in a legal case. It is a crucial part of the legal process and helps to establish the facts of the case. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer among the given choices."}}
{"Q": "What does a successful dog grooming session likely to make a owner feel?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cleanliness (B) mistakes (C) growth (D) satisfaction (E) late", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: A successful dog grooming session is likely to make an owner feel satisfied.

{"Q": "The runner was in third place, but he pushed harder and thought he might be able to reach second.  What was beginning to do?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) near finish line (B) finish (C) get tired (D) gain ground (E) trip over", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. gain ground.\n\nExplanation: The sentence states that the runner was in third place but pushed harder, indicating that he was trying to improve his position. The phrase \"thought he might be able to reach second\" suggests that he was making progress and gaining ground on the runner in second place.

Anxiety and fear.\n\nExplanation: Applying for a job can be a stressful experience, as it involves putting oneself out there and potentially facing rejection. It is common for individuals to feel anxious and fearful about the outcome of their application, as they may be worried about not being qualified enough or not standing out among other applicants. However, it is important to remember that these feelings are normal and that with preparation and a positive attitude, one can increase their chances of success."}}

Therefore, it is plausible that the individual was also found guilty of committing perjury in addition to obstructing justice. Choices A, B, C, and D do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not plausible answers."}}
{"Q": "What kind of feelings does buying presents for others create?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) tears (B) please (C) like (D) thank (E) make happy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. make happy.\nExplanation: Buying presents for others usually creates a feeling of happiness, both for the giver and the receiver. It is a way of showing love, appreciation, and gratitude towards someone, and the act of giving can bring joy and satisfaction to the giver. Seeing the recipient's happy reaction can also create a sense of fulfillment and contentment. While tears, please, like, and thank can also be associated with gift-giving, make happy is the most plausible answer as it captures the positive emotions that are typically associated with this act."}}

They are not typically found in the great plains or jungle regions, and while they are found in North America, this answer is too broad. The option \"encyclopedia\" is not a green area and is not a plausible answer. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. countryside."}}

He thought that the wires might have too much what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) later (B) updated (C) still (D) resistance (E) now", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Jan noticed that the current was high, which could indicate that there is too much resistance in the wires. Resistance is the measure of how much a material opposes the flow of electric current, so if there is too much resistance in the wires, it can cause the current to be higher than desired. Therefore, option D, resistance, is the most plausible answer."}}

The child in the scenario is pretending to read a newspaper, which implies that he does not actually know how to read. Therefore, he cannot read the newspaper without literacy.

It provides a curriculum, a teacher, and a community of learners to support and guide you through the learning process.

{"Q": "What could you get an unsmooth pit from?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) backyard (B) rock (C) mine (D) cherry (E) peach", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. peach\nExplanation: Peach pits are known to have a rough, unsmooth texture on the outside. Backyards and rocks are unlikely to produce pits, and while mines may produce rough materials, they are not typically associated with producing pits. Cherry pits are also generally smooth on the outside. Therefore, peach is the most plausible answer for an unsmooth pit."}}
{"Q": "The man tried to reply to the woman, but he had difficulty keeping track of conversations that he didn't do what to?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) initiate (B) ignore (C) question (D) answer (E) ask", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. ask\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the man had difficulty keeping track of conversations, which implies that he was struggling to follow the woman's words. Therefore, it would make sense for him to ask her to repeat or clarify what she said, rather than initiating a new topic, ignoring her, questioning her, or answering a question she didn't ask. Asking for clarification is a common strategy for improving communication and avoiding misunderstandings."}}
{"Q": "I couldn't find anybody who recalled the event, what were they adroit at doing?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) question authority (B) act fool (C) wash dishes (D) act innocent (E) forget", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. question authority.\nExplanation: The fact that nobody could recall the event suggests that it was not a particularly memorable or significant event. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individuals in question were adroit at acting foolishly or washing dishes. Additionally, the fact that nobody remembered the event suggests that it was not a scandal or controversy, making it unlikely that the individuals were adroit at acting innocent. The most plausible option is that they were adroit at questioning authority, which may not have been memorable enough to stick in people's minds."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a large dining room containing a fancy chandelier?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) mansion (B) every house (C) own home (D) table (E) restaurant", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. mansion\nExplanation: A large dining room with a fancy chandelier is more commonly found in a mansion, which is a large and luxurious house, than in an average home or restaurant. It is not a common feature in every house or on a regular table. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The extremely large cargo plane could only land at a specialized runway, these were only located at a what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) back yard (B) bowling alley (C) city (D) military base (E) fashion show", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Military base.\nExplanation: Military bases often have specialized runways that can accommodate large cargo planes due to their need for transportation of military equipment and supplies. Backyards, bowling alleys, cities, and fashion shows are not suitable locations for such runways."}}
{"Q": "The carpet was smelly and discouraged the league from playing there, where was this smelly carpet installed?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bedroom (B) movie theater (C) bowling alley (D) church (E) office", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. bowling alley\nExplanation: A bowling alley is a place where people play sports and the carpet is an important part of the playing surface. If the carpet is smelly, it can discourage players from playing there. On the other hand, a bedroom, movie theater, church, or office may not necessarily require a carpet for playing or other activities, so the presence of a smelly carpet may not have as much impact on the use of the space."}}
{"Q": "How can someone be let into a brownstone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) brooklyn (B) ring (C) subdivision (D) bricks (E) new york city", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Ring.\nExplanation: Brownstones typically have a doorbell or intercom system, so the most plausible way for someone to be let into a brownstone is by ringing the doorbell or calling the resident to be buzzed in."}}
{"Q": "Where would someone purchase an upright piano?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) music class (B) college (C) music store (D) music room (E) music band", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. music store\nExplanation: A music store is a more plausible option for purchasing an upright piano as they specialize in selling musical instruments and equipment. Music classes, colleges, and music rooms may have pianos for use, but they are not typically in the business of selling them. Music bands may use pianos, but they are not likely to have a need to purchase one for themselves."}}
{"Q": "Where would you keep an ottoman near your front door?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) living room (B) parlor (C) furniture store (D) basement (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. living room\nExplanation: Ottomans are typically used as a footrest or extra seating in a living room. It would not make sense to keep it in a parlor, furniture store, basement, or kitchen near the front door. Therefore, the most plausible answer is the living room."}}
{"Q": "Diving into backyard pools can be very dangerous and can lead to serious head and what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) going somewhere (B) splats (C) cancer (D) getting wet (E) spinal injuries", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. spinal injuries\nExplanation: Diving into shallow water can cause serious spinal injuries, including paralysis. It is important to always check the depth of the pool before diving and to never dive into shallow water."}}
{"Q": "Where would one find a snake in a cage?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) tropical forest (B) oregon (C) woods (D) pet store (E) louisiana", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Pet store.\nExplanation: A snake in a cage is most likely to be found in a pet store, where they are commonly kept as pets. While snakes can be found in the other locations listed, they would not necessarily be in a cage in those environments."}}
{"Q": "Where are people likely to become impatient?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) end of line (B) buildings (C) apartment (D) neighbor's house (E) address", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: End of line.\nExplanation: People are likely to become impatient at the end of a line, such as a checkout line at a store or a line for a popular attraction. This is because they have been waiting for a period of time and are eager to complete their task or move on to the next activity. Additionally, if the line is moving slowly or there are delays, this can further increase impatience."}}
{"Q": "When you fail to finish something, you failed at doing what to it", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) winning (B) passing (C) completing (D) do well (E) succeeding", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. completing\nExplanation: When you fail to finish something, it means you were not able to complete it. Winning, passing, doing well, and succeeding are all related to achieving a goal or objective, but completing refers specifically to finishing a task or project."}}
{"Q": "John didn't care about style.  He felt that form was less important than what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) shapeless (B) quality (C) function (D) change shape (E) chaos", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) function\nExplanation: John believed that the primary concern should be whether something works well and serves its intended purpose, rather than how it looks or its aesthetic appeal. Therefore, he valued function over form."}}
{"Q": "When you get together with friends to watch film, you might do plenty of this?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) see what happens (B) enjoy stories (C) pass time (D) have fun (E) interesting", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. have fun.\nExplanation: When getting together with friends to watch a film, the main objective is usually to have a good time and enjoy each other's company. While enjoying the story and passing time may also be factors, the primary reason for gathering is to have fun."}}
{"Q": "A supermarket is uncommon in what type of collection of shops?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) strip mall (B) city or town (C) shoppingcentre (D) boutique (E) vermont", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. boutique\nExplanation: A boutique is a small, specialized shop that typically sells high-end or unique items. Supermarkets are not typically found in this type of collection of shops, as they focus on a specific niche market rather than offering a wide range of everyday goods. Strip malls, shopping centers, and even some cities and towns often have supermarkets as anchor stores. Vermont is not a relevant option as it is a state, not a type of collection of shops."}}
{"Q": "Bill puts meat on the scale, where does Bill work?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) music store (B) assay office (C) tidal wave (D) butcher shop (E) bathroom", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Butcher shop.\nExplanation: The fact that Bill is putting meat on a scale suggests that he is weighing it for sale, which is a common practice in a butcher shop. The other options (music store, assay office, tidal wave, bathroom) do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "I'm having some food at my party, what will I need to serve it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) zoo (B) pan (C) bowl (D) kitchen (E) spoon", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (C) bowl, as it is a common serving dish for food at parties. A zoo is not relevant to serving food, a pan may be used for cooking but not necessarily for serving, a kitchen is a room and not a serving utensil, and a spoon is a utensil used for eating, not serving."}}
{"Q": "Before racers start to run they must do what at the starting line?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) learn to walk (B) walking (C) walk slowly (D) breathe (E) stand still", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: Before racers start to run, they must stand still at the starting line. This is to ensure that all racers start at the same time and have an equal opportunity to win. Standing still also allows racers to focus and prepare themselves mentally for the race ahead."}}
{"Q": "What does an actor do when they are bored of their roles?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) mask (B) branch out (C) wear costume (D) pretend (E) sing songs", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Branch out.\nExplanation: When an actor gets bored of their roles, they can choose to branch out and explore different types of roles or genres. This can help them challenge themselves and keep their career fresh and exciting. They can also take on new projects outside of acting, such as directing or producing, to keep themselves engaged in the industry. Masking, wearing costumes, pretending, and singing songs may be techniques used in acting, but they are not necessarily solutions to boredom with roles."}}
{"Q": "What is a person called who doesn't have immortality?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) mortal (B) dying (C) death (D) dead (E) mortal", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. mortal\nExplanation: A mortal is a person who is subject to death and does not possess immortality. This term is commonly used to describe human beings who have a limited lifespan and are not immortal like gods or supernatural beings. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Why would you be watching tv instead of doing something else?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) headache (B) laughter (C) laziness (D) erections (E) wasting time", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) laughter\nExplanation: Watching TV can be a form of entertainment and relaxation. If someone is watching TV and laughing, it could be because they are enjoying a comedy show or a funny movie. Laughter is a natural stress reliever and can improve mood, so it is a valid reason for someone to choose to watch TV instead of doing something else."}}
{"Q": "If chewing food is difficult for you, what is a possible reason?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) broken jaw (B) sore mouth (C) eating (D) good digestion (E) avoiding choking", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. sore mouth\nExplanation: If chewing food is difficult, it could be due to a sore mouth. This could be caused by a variety of factors such as dental problems, mouth ulcers, or infections. A broken jaw (A) would likely make it impossible to chew at all, while good digestion (D) and avoiding choking (E) are not related to the act of chewing itself. Eating (C) is not a reason for difficulty in chewing, but rather the activity that is affected by the difficulty."}}
{"Q": "He had to wear a tuxedo while playing the keyboard instrument, so did the other hundred members of the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) music store (B) band (C) medium (D) orchestra (E) piano store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. orchestra.\nExplanation: The fact that the person had to wear a tuxedo while playing a keyboard instrument suggests that they were part of a formal musical group, such as an orchestra. A tuxedo is a common dress code for orchestra members during performances. The other options, such as music store, band, medium, and piano store, do not typically require formal attire for playing a keyboard instrument."}}
{"Q": "Where do you find the most amount of leafs?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) floral arrangement (B) ground (C) forrest (D) field (E) compost pile", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. forest.\nExplanation: Forests are known for having a large number of trees, which in turn have a large number of leaves. The ground and fields may have some leaves, but not as many as a forest. Floral arrangements are intentionally arranged with a limited number of leaves, and compost piles are made up of decomposing organic matter, which may include leaves, but not necessarily in large quantities. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C. forest."}}
{"Q": "Where can children play with animals?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) meadow (B) play room (C) surface of earth (D) zoos (E) fairgrounds", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Zoos.\nExplanation: Zoos are specifically designed to provide a safe and educational environment for children to interact with animals. They have trained staff to ensure the safety of both the animals and visitors. Meadows and fairgrounds may have animals, but they are not necessarily safe or appropriate for children to play with them. Playrooms are typically indoors and do not have live animals. The surface of the earth is too broad and vague to be a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What kind of tale might feature a talking weasel?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) mulberry bush (B) animated film (C) chicken coop (D) history book (E) children's story", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. children's story\nExplanation: A talking weasel is a common character in children's stories, often used to teach a moral lesson or to add a sense of whimsy to the story. Weasels are also known for their mischievous and cunning nature, making them a popular choice for children's stories where they can be portrayed as either a hero or a villain."}}
{"Q": "What kind of status is the bald eagle given?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) outside (B) world (C) protection (D) colorado (E) america", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) protection\nExplanation: The bald eagle is given protection status in America under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. This act prohibits the killing, selling, or possession of bald eagles and their parts, nests, or eggs without a permit. The bald eagle is considered a symbol of America and is protected to ensure its survival and conservation."}}
{"Q": "Why do most people take a quick rest during the day?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) need to (B) hungry (C) feel more energetic (D) weak (E) regenerate", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Most people take a quick rest during the day to feel more energetic. Taking a short break can help to recharge the body and mind, allowing individuals to be more productive and focused when they return to their tasks. It can also help to prevent burnout and reduce stress levels. While some people may need to rest due to feeling weak or fatigued, the majority of individuals take breaks to boost their energy levels. Hunger is also not typically a reason for taking a quick rest, as most people will simply eat a snack or meal to address their hunger rather than taking a break. Regeneration is not a common reason for taking a quick rest during the day, as this typically refers to more long-term processes such as healing from an injury or illness."}}
{"Q": "What could suddenly stop someone when he or she is running?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) mushroom (B) falling down (C) sweating (D) exhaustion (E) getting tired", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) exhaustion\nExplanation: When someone is running, they are expending a lot of energy and using their muscles to move quickly. If they continue to run without taking a break or slowing down, they may become exhausted and unable to continue running. This can cause them to suddenly stop running and need to rest. Mushrooms, sweating, and getting tired may not necessarily cause someone to suddenly stop running, while falling down could be a result of exhaustion or other factors."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a monkey in the wild?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) zoo (B) barrel (C) research laboratory (D) captivity (E) thailand", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Thailand\nExplanation: Monkeys are commonly found in the wild in various parts of the world, including Asia, Africa, and South America. Thailand is known for its diverse wildlife, including several species of monkeys such as macaques and langurs. While monkeys can also be found in zoos, research laboratories, and captivity, the most plausible answer for where to find a monkey in the wild would be in their natural habitat, such as in the forests and jungles of Thailand."}}
{"Q": "Where could a sloth live?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) tropical jungle (B) manual (C) work (D) transit (E) countryside", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. tropical jungle\nExplanation: Sloths are arboreal animals that spend most of their time in trees. They are native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, where they can find the leaves and fruits they need to survive. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A, tropical jungle. The other options, such as manual, work, transit, or countryside, do not provide the necessary habitat or resources for a sloth to live."}}
{"Q": "A gentleman is carrying equipment for golf, what is he likely to have?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) club (B) assembly hall (C) meditation center (D) meeting (E) church", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: A gentleman carrying equipment for golf is likely to have clubs, which are the essential tools used to hit the ball in golf. The other options, such as assembly hall, meditation center, meeting, and church, are not related to golf equipment."}}
{"Q": "If you have a home with a courtyard, what's one thing you probably don't have to care for any longer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) lawn (B) kids (C) asshole (D) spain (E) office complex", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. lawn\nExplanation: A courtyard typically refers to an enclosed outdoor space within a home or building, often paved or tiled. It is unlikely to have a lawn in a courtyard as it would require regular maintenance and watering. Instead, the focus is usually on decorative plants, trees, and other landscaping features that require less upkeep."}}
{"Q": "The computer was difficult for he to understand at the store, so what did she sign up for to learn more?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) classroom (B) facebook (C) school (D) apartment (E) demonstration", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A classroom.\nExplanation: If the computer was difficult for her to understand at the store, it is likely that she needs more structured and formal learning to understand it better. Signing up for a classroom course would provide her with a teacher and a curriculum to follow, which would be more effective than trying to learn through social media (Facebook) or a brief demonstration. School could also be a plausible answer, but it is more general and could refer to any type of educational institution, while a classroom specifically implies a course or program. An apartment is not related to learning about computers."}}
{"Q": "If you take the risk buying a used car, you still hope it can what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) go fast (B) start running (C) going too fast (D) look good (E) last several years", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. last several years.\nExplanation: When buying a used car, the hope is that it will last for several years without major issues. While going fast or looking good may be desirable, the primary concern is the car's reliability and longevity. Starting to run is also important, but it is assumed that the car will start running if it is being sold. Therefore, option E is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Dan was ditting quietly on the couch with a book in his hand.  Laurie thought that he was just focused on what he was doing, but he actually did what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) eat (B) think (C) reading (D) meditate (E) fall asleep", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. reading\nExplanation: The sentence states that Dan was sitting quietly on the couch with a book in his hand, which suggests that he was reading. The other options (eating, thinking, meditating, falling asleep) are not supported by the information given in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What is the primary purpose of cars?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cost money (B) slow down (C) move people (D) turn right (E) get girls", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. move people\nExplanation: The primary purpose of cars is to transport people from one place to another. While cars do cost money, they are not primarily designed for that purpose. Similarly, cars are not designed to slow down or turn right, although those are functions they can perform. And while some people may use cars to impress others, that is not the primary purpose of cars."}}
{"Q": "Alabama is full of different people, but they are all citizens of what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) united states (B) deep south (C) floribama (D) gulf states (E) florabama", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. United States.\n\nExplanation: Alabama is one of the 50 states that make up the United States of America. Therefore, all the people living in Alabama are citizens of the United States. The other options, such as Deep South, Floribama, and Gulf States, are regional descriptions that may apply to Alabama, but they do not represent the legal and political identity of the state's citizens. Florabama is a colloquial term used to describe the border region between Florida and Alabama, but it is not an official designation. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They were hoping their campaign would create a rise in awareness of the problem and hopefully do what to its effect?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) set (B) fall (C) park (D) descend (E) reduce", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (E) reduce\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the campaign aimed to increase awareness of a problem. If the campaign was successful, it would have likely led to more people taking action to address the problem, which would have reduced its effect. Therefore, (E) reduce is the most plausible answer. The other options, such as (A) set, (B) fall, (C) park, and (D) descend, do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What do airplanes do as they are arriving at the gate?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) slow down (B) crash (C) speed up (D) land (E) carry people", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) slow down\nExplanation: As airplanes approach the gate, they need to slow down in order to safely come to a stop and park at the gate. This is typically done by reducing engine power and using brakes to gradually slow down the aircraft. Crashing or speeding up would obviously be dangerous and not a standard part of the arrival process, while landing is typically done on a runway before taxiing to the gate. And while airplanes do carry people, this is not specifically related to the process of arriving at the gate."}}
{"Q": "If a person with mental illness stops treatment what will likely happen?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) managed (B) dancing (C) recur (D) effectively treated (E) cause suffering", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. recur.\nExplanation: If a person with mental illness stops treatment, there is a high likelihood that their symptoms will recur or return. Mental illnesses are chronic conditions that require ongoing management and treatment. Without treatment, symptoms can worsen and lead to significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. It is important for individuals with mental illness to continue treatment as prescribed by their healthcare provider to effectively manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life."}}
{"Q": "The gimmicky low brow TV show was about animals when they what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) sick (B) mammals (C) males (D) bite (E) attack", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. mammals\nExplanation: The word \"animals\" is a broad term that can refer to any living organism that is not a plant. However, the word \"mammals\" is a more specific term that refers to a particular group of animals that have certain characteristics, such as giving birth to live young and producing milk for their offspring. It is more plausible that a TV show would focus on a specific group of animals, such as mammals, rather than a vague and unrelated topic like sickness or attacking. Additionally, the use of the word \"gimmicky\" suggests that the show may have been trying to appeal to a broad audience by using a catchy or attention-grabbing theme, which could explain why they chose to focus on a specific group of animals."}}
{"Q": "A loud machine is irritating, but many are expected where?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) museum (B) house (C) laboratory (D) library (E) industrial area", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. industrial area\nExplanation: In an industrial area, there are many factories and machines that are expected to be loud due to the nature of the work being done. In a museum, house, laboratory, or library, loud machines would be out of place and disruptive."}}
{"Q": "What part of a table would you put a ruler in?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) drawer (B) desk (C) the backside (D) office (E) measure distance", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Measure distance.\nExplanation: A ruler is a tool used to measure distance, so it would make the most sense to use it for that purpose on a table. It wouldn't be practical to store a ruler in a drawer or on the backside of a table, and it doesn't make sense to put it in an office or on a desk without a specific purpose."}}
{"Q": "What happens if someone kisses too long?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) strong feelings (B) herpes (C) shortness of breath (D) excitement (E) arousal", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Shortness of breath.\nExplanation: Prolonged kissing can lead to a decrease in oxygen intake, which can cause shortness of breath. This is especially true if the kissing is intense and involves a lot of tongue action. It is important to take breaks and breathe during kissing to avoid this discomfort. While strong feelings, excitement, and arousal can also be a result of kissing, herpes is a sexually transmitted infection that can be transmitted through kissing, but it is not a direct result of kissing too long."}}
{"Q": "If I have a modern light source in my living room, what is it likely to be?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sky (B) house (C) lamp (D) match (E) candle", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. lamp\nExplanation: A modern light source in a living room is most likely to be a lamp, as it is a common household item used for lighting. The other options, such as the sky, house, match, and candle, are not typically used as light sources in a living room setting."}}
{"Q": "The person saw the mess his children made, what was his following reaction?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) smell smoke (B) cross street (C) cry (D) bank savings (E) look angry", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. look angry\nExplanation: It is a common reaction for a parent to feel angry or frustrated when they see a mess their children have made. This is because they may feel like their hard work in keeping the house clean has been undone, or they may be worried about the safety of their children if the mess is particularly hazardous. Therefore, looking angry is a more plausible reaction in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Who might wear dark glasses indoors?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) blind person (B) glove box (C) movie studio (D) ray charles (E) glove compartment", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A blind person.\nExplanation: A blind person may wear dark glasses indoors as a form of protection from bright lights or to reduce glare. It is a common practice among visually impaired individuals. The other options, such as glove box, movie studio, Ray Charles, and glove compartment, do not make sense in the context of wearing dark glasses indoors."}}
{"Q": "Where would stones not be arranged in a path?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) quarries (B) field (C) park (D) bridge (E) made from rocks", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) quarries\nExplanation: Stones would not be arranged in a path in quarries because quarries are places where stones are extracted from the ground and are not meant for walking paths. The stones in quarries are usually in their natural state and are not arranged in any particular order. In contrast, stones are commonly arranged in paths in fields, parks, bridges, and other outdoor areas where people walk. Therefore, (A) quarries is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A bald eagle is likely to be found on what kind of work?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) rural area (B) book (C) canada (D) painting (E) aviary", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. rural area\nExplanation: Bald eagles are known to inhabit areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and coastlines. These areas are often found in rural or wilderness areas, away from urban development. Therefore, it is more likely to find a bald eagle in a rural area than in a book, Canada, painting, or aviary."}}
{"Q": "The hostess was good at her job, she always had a smile when she would what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) group people (B) ready parlor for guests (C) welcome guests (D) work room (E) park", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. welcome guests.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the hostess was good at her job, and the most common job of a hostess is to welcome guests. The other options, such as grouping people or working in a room, do not necessarily require a smile or relate to the job of a hostess. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What is likely to happen to someone who is learning?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) overconfidence (B) effectiveness (C) knowing more (D) head grows larger (E) growth", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. growth\nExplanation: Learning is a process of acquiring new knowledge, skills, and experiences. As someone learns, they are likely to experience growth in their understanding and abilities. This growth can come in many forms, such as increased confidence, effectiveness, and knowledge. However, it is unlikely to lead to overconfidence or a physically larger head. Therefore, the most plausible answer is growth."}}
{"Q": "The inspector was agreeing with the factory protocols, what was the status of the factory?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) compliance (B) eligible (C) contract (D) harmony (E) friendship", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Compliance.\nExplanation: The word \"protocols\" suggests that there are established rules and procedures that the factory is expected to follow. The fact that the inspector is agreeing with these protocols indicates that the factory is in compliance with them, meaning that it is meeting the necessary standards and requirements. Therefore, option (A) compliance is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "After standing up I had to sit right back down, why would I feel like this?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) train (B) effort (C) balance (D) feet (E) muscles", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C) balance\n\nExplanation: When standing up, our body needs to maintain balance by adjusting the position of our feet and muscles. If there is a problem with our balance, we may feel dizzy or unsteady, which can cause us to sit back down. This could be due to various reasons such as inner ear problems, low blood pressure, or medication side effects. Therefore, option C) balance seems like a more plausible answer in this scenario."}}

This allows for socializing over a meal and drinks before moving on to a different venue for more drinks and entertainment. Going to a park or nightclub before a bar would not be as common, and New York City and Las Vegas are specific locations rather than activities."}}
{"Q": "The dad wanted to protect his house, where did he put his gun?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) police station (B) crime scene (C) restroom (D) drawer (E) holster", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. drawer\nExplanation: It is common for people to keep their guns in a secure and easily accessible location, such as a drawer, to protect their home and family from potential intruders. Keeping a gun in a police station or crime scene would not make sense as those are not personal locations, and keeping it in a restroom or holster may not provide quick access in case of an emergency."}}

Watching a film or hanging out at a bar are not appropriate activities for children, and a fire game or skiing may not be possible or safe on a ramp."}}
{"Q": "What animal has quills all over it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) feather (B) chicken (C) calligraphy (D) porcupine (E) hedgehog", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Porcupines are known for their quills, which cover their entire body. These quills are used as a defense mechanism against predators. Hedgehogs also have quills, but they are shorter and not as sharp as those of a porcupine. Feathers are not quills, and chickens and calligraphy have nothing to do with quills."}}
{"Q": "Why would you go to an office?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) work (B) school building (C) paper (D) city (E) habit", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. work\nExplanation: Offices are typically associated with places of work, where employees go to perform their job duties. While it is possible to work remotely or from home, many jobs still require employees to physically go to an office to complete their work tasks. Therefore, going to an office is a plausible answer for why someone would need to visit one."}}

They can also make their nests in the soil or under piles of leaves. While they may prefer the warmth and shelter of a house, they can also be found in outdoor areas such as gardens. Choices A, B, D, and E are less likely as mice do not typically inhabit tins, department stores, small holes, or cupboards in the wild."}}
{"Q": "What is performing a type of?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) singing (B) act (C) feat (D) smile (E) acting", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: Performing is typically associated with acting, which involves portraying a character or role through various physical and emotional expressions.

The other choices, such as \"speed up\" and \"go fast,\" do not necessarily indicate a specific direction or goal. \"Headed south\" is the opposite direction of New York and therefore not a plausible answer."}}

It allows the potato to cook evenly and become soft and tender. Placing the potato in a paper bag or cupboard will not cook it, and placing it underground is a method of baking potatoes, which requires a longer cooking time. Restaurants may cook potatoes in various ways, but boiling is a common method used in many kitchens."}}

{"Q": "How are the conditions for someone who is living in a homeless shelter?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sometimes bad (B) happy (C) respiration (D) growing older (E) death", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. sometimes bad.\nExplanation: Living conditions in homeless shelters can vary widely, but they are often crowded and uncomfortable. Many people who stay in homeless shelters have experienced trauma, mental illness, or addiction, which can make it difficult to feel safe or comfortable in a communal living environment. Additionally, homeless shelters may have limited resources, such as food, clothing, and medical care, which can make it challenging for residents to meet their basic needs. While some people may find temporary relief from homelessness in a shelter, the conditions are often far from ideal."}}

While knitting may not directly produce a sweater (as this would require additional steps such as blocking and seaming), it can certainly be a step towards creating one."}}
{"Q": "What might a very large table be?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) dining room (B) conference (C) kitchen (D) in a lake (E) demonstration", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. conference\nExplanation: A very large table is more likely to be found in a conference room where it can accommodate a large number of people for meetings, discussions, and presentations. While a dining room table can also be large, it is typically not as large as a conference table. A kitchen table is usually smaller and meant for more intimate gatherings. \"In a lake\" and \"demonstration\" are not plausible answers as they do not make sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "John got his tax refund back.  He treated it like it was what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) candy (B) death and (C) free money (D) discount (E) credit", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. free money\nExplanation: John treated his tax refund like it was free money because he did not expect to receive it and did not have any specific plans for it. Many people view tax refunds as a bonus or windfall, rather than money they earned throughout the year. Therefore, it is plausible that John treated his tax refund as free money."}}
{"Q": "A person with an allergy might be doing what if they awake suddenly?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) have fun (B) enjoy with friends (C) stretch (D) yawn (E) sneezing", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. sneezing\nExplanation: If a person with an allergy suddenly wakes up, they may experience sneezing as a symptom of their allergy.

They can also be found outdoors in parks or in their natural habitat in North Carolina or Great Britain."}}
{"Q": "If you jump in any of the oceans you will get?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) tanned (B) wet (C) wide (D) very deep (E) fish", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. wet\nExplanation: When you jump in any of the oceans, you will get wet because the oceans are bodies of saltwater and you will be submerged in it. Tanning, width, and depth are not immediate effects of jumping in the ocean, and while there may be fish in the ocean, it is not guaranteed that you will encounter them by simply jumping in."}}
{"Q": "Immediately after peeing, a person's bladder is what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) collapsed (B) empty (C) full (D) filled (E) stretchable", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Empty.\n\nExplanation: When a person urinates, the bladder contracts and empties its contents through the urethra. This means that immediately after peeing, the bladder should be empty, with no urine left inside. Therefore, option B, \"empty,\" is the most plausible answer. Options A, C, D, and E are all incorrect because they suggest that the bladder still contains urine after peeing, which is not the case."}}
{"Q": "The lady would eat and eat, and because of mental issues would then make herself what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) wash dishes (B) throwing up (C) drinking (D) throw up (E) turn inside out", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. throwing up.\nExplanation: The lady's behavior of eating excessively and then inducing vomiting is a common symptom of bulimia, an eating disorder that is often associated with mental health issues. Washing dishes or drinking do not fit the pattern of this behavior, and \"turning inside out\" is not a realistic option. Therefore, throwing up is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A car was hailed to chauffeur someone to the opera house, where was it heading?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) go downtown (B) appear suddenly (C) go fast (D) bottom out (E) east", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. go downtown.\nExplanation: The context of the sentence suggests that the car was hailed to take someone to the opera house, which is typically located in a downtown area. Therefore, it is more plausible that the car was heading downtown rather than suddenly appearing, going fast, bottoming out, or heading east."}}
{"Q": "What do you go to see for live entertainment?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) movie (B) show (C) concert venue (D) casino (E) theatre", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. show\nExplanation: When people go to see live entertainment, they often go to see a show, such as a musical, play, or comedy performance. Shows offer a unique and immersive experience that cannot be replicated by watching a movie or listening to music at home. Additionally, shows often feature talented performers and impressive production values, making them a popular choice for live entertainment. While concerts and theaters are also popular options, a show encompasses a wider range of performances and genres."}}
{"Q": "The teacher thought that a ferret can be very mischievous and probably wouldn't make a great pet for the entire what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bad mood (B) hutch (C) classroom (D) pair of trousers (E) year", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The teacher's concern about a ferret being mischievous suggests that it may not be suitable as a pet in a classroom setting where there are many students and potential distractions. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) classroom. The other options, such as (A) bad mood, (B) hutch, and (D) pair of trousers, are not relevant to the context of the sentence. (E) year is also unlikely as it does not relate to the suitability of a ferret as a pet."}}

Valleys are low-lying areas between hills or mountains, and are often the location of creeks and other bodies of water. Forests, outdoors, countryside, and woods are all general terms that could describe the location of a creek, but valley is the most specific and accurate answer."}}
{"Q": "If I have a pet bird, what does it likely live in?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) forest (B) bathroom (C) windowsill (D) countryside (E) cage", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Cage\nExplanation: Pet birds are typically kept in cages for their safety and well-being. Cages provide a controlled environment where the bird can eat, sleep, and play without the risk of injury or escape. While some birds may be allowed to fly freely in a designated area, they still require a cage for their own safety when unsupervised. Forests, bathrooms, windowsills, and countryside are not suitable living environments for pet birds."}}
{"Q": "Joe and Mac were playing basketball. They did it every day in their back yard.  Why were they playing basketball?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) study (B) have fun (C) pain (D) cheers (E) knee injury", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. have fun.\nExplanation: Joe and Mac were playing basketball in their back yard every day, which suggests that they were doing it for leisure and enjoyment. If they were studying, they would likely be indoors and focused on their books. If they were experiencing pain or a knee injury, it is unlikely that they would be playing basketball every day. Similarly, if they were cheering for a team, they would likely be watching a game rather than playing themselves. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that they were playing basketball to have fun."}}
{"Q": "What makes someone a nomad?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) unpleasant things (B) hangnail (C) have no home (D) have no car (E) schizophrenia", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. have no home.\nExplanation: A nomad is someone who does not have a permanent home and instead travels from place to place. This could be due to cultural or historical reasons, or simply a personal choice. The other options, such as unpleasant things, hangnail, or schizophrenia, do not have any direct correlation to being a nomad. Having no car may make it more difficult to travel, but it is not a defining characteristic of being a nomad."}}
{"Q": "What is a treat that you dog will enjoy?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) salad (B) petted (C) affection (D) bone (E) lots of attention", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. bone\nExplanation: Dogs are natural chewers and enjoy gnawing on bones.

This means that part of his brain was still functioning and able to focus on the task at hand, despite any other factors that may have been affecting him. The other options (awake, repeat, sleeping, read aloud) do not necessarily explain how Joe was able to memorize the list despite his apparent state."}}
{"Q": "What is a wet person likely to do?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) gain weight (B) thank god (C) catch cold (D) suicide (E) cross street", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. catch cold.\nExplanation: When a person gets wet, especially in cold weather, their body temperature drops, making them more susceptible to catching a cold or flu.

The other options, such as passing around or wellness, do not accurately describe the patient's condition after recovering from a disease. Cure could also be a possible answer, but it is more commonly used to describe the treatment or medication that led to the patient's recovery rather than the patient themselves."}}

Paper bag.\n\nExplanation: The grocery clerk is likely to put the individual potato in a paper bag. This is a common practice in grocery stores to prevent the potato from getting bruised or damaged during transportation or storage. The paper bag also helps to keep the potato fresh by allowing it to breathe and preventing moisture buildup. Boiling water, root cellar, and underground are not plausible options as they are not relevant to the storage or display of individual potatoes in a grocery store. Rocket ship is also not a plausible option as it is not a common mode of transportation for grocery items."}}

The other options, such as doorway, living room, sand, and floors, do not make sense as they are not typically associated with the use of a bath mat."}}
{"Q": "What would you put meat on top of to cook it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) oil (B) freezer (C) ham sandwich (D) oven (E) frying pan", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. frying pan\nExplanation: When cooking meat, it is common to use a frying pan to sear or sauté it. This allows for the meat to cook evenly and develop a crispy exterior. Using oil in the frying pan can also help prevent sticking and add flavor to the meat. Freezing the meat or putting it on a ham sandwich would not be appropriate cooking methods, and while an oven can be used to cook meat, it is not typically used to cook meat on top of something."}}
{"Q": "Minerals can be obtained in what way for a person who avoids leafy greens?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) multivitamin (B) farm (C) michigan (D) earth (E) ore", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Multivitamin.\nExplanation: If a person avoids leafy greens, they may miss out on important minerals such as iron, calcium, and magnesium. However, these minerals can be obtained through a multivitamin supplement. It is important to choose a high-quality multivitamin that contains the necessary minerals in the correct amounts.

Parties can be fun, but they can also be time-consuming, and it's likely that John was too tired or hungover to focus on studying the next day."}}

Summarizing main points may not provide enough detail, closing the mouth is not a viable option, talking is not effective, and disagreeing is not relevant to the question."}}

However, it is believed that God will never judge men unfairly or without compassion. This is because God is seen as a loving and forgiving deity who wants all people to be saved and to live a good life. Therefore, it is believed that God will never judge men in a way that is unjust or cruel."}}

Therefore, it is the most plausible answer for where the child's chore would be to load the dirty dishes. The other options, such as a restaurant kitchen or a party, are not relevant to the situation and would not make sense as a place to load dirty dishes. The son's room and cabinet are also not appropriate places for dirty dishes to be loaded."}}

A bank or pay envelope would also be unlikely as the check would typically be deposited or given directly to the recipient. Therefore, option B, desk drawer, is the most likely choice for where the dad hid the check."}}
{"Q": "For some reason she was devoid of regular emotions, buying products was the only way she could feel what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) pleasure (B) owning (C) debt (D) spending money (E) smart", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. pleasure\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person lacks regular emotions and can only feel something through buying products. The most likely emotion that one can feel through buying products is pleasure or satisfaction. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B, owning, is not an emotion but a state of possession. Option C, debt, is a negative emotion and does not fit the context. Option D, spending money, is not an emotion but an action. Option E, smart, is not an emotion but a feeling of intelligence or competence."}}
{"Q": "Where are horses judged on appearance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) race track (B) fair (C) raised by humans (D) in a field (E) countryside", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. fair\nExplanation: Horses are often judged on their appearance at fairs and horse shows. These events are specifically designed to showcase the beauty and abilities of horses, and judges evaluate the animals based on criteria such as conformation, movement, and overall appearance. While horses may also be evaluated on the race track or in other settings, fairs and horse shows are the most common venues for appearance-based judging."}}

Watching television or eating may not be feasible as it requires visual attention and the use of hands, which may interfere with knitting. Making blankets is a possible activity while knitting, but it is not related to the use of a radio. Therefore, listening to music is the most plausible answer."}}

In this case, John's debt of 50 million dollars is so much larger than Leo's debt of 2000 dollars that it makes Leo's debt seem insignificant or inconsequential in comparison. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A. dwarf."}}
{"Q": "The man flew his airplane over the city and saw pollution visibly in the sky, what was polluted?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) forest (B) street (C) air (D) caused by humans (E) car show", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. air\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the man saw pollution in the sky, which indicates that the air was polluted. The other options, such as forest, street, and car show, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The option D, caused by humans, could be a possible answer, but it is too broad and does not specify what exactly was polluted. Therefore, option C, air, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What is a very unlikely side effect of becoming inebriated?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) fights (B) drunkenness (C) staggering (D) puke (E) paralysis", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: Paralysis is a very unlikely side effect of becoming inebriated.

{"Q": "when communicating with my boss what should i do", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) misunderstandings (B) transfer of information (C) learning (D) confusion (E) silence", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Transfer of information.\nExplanation: When communicating with your boss, the main goal should be to transfer information effectively. This means that you should be clear and concise in your communication, and ensure that your boss understands what you are saying. Misunderstandings and confusion can lead to mistakes and delays, so it is important to be as clear as possible. Learning can also be a goal of communication, but it should not be the primary focus when communicating with your boss. Silence is not an effective way to communicate, as it does not allow for the transfer of information."}}
{"Q": "If not in a stream but in a market where will you find fish?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) stream (B) aquarium (C) refrigerator (D) boat ride (E) market", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Market.\nExplanation: Fish can be found in markets where they are sold for consumption. While fish can be found in streams, aquariums, and on boat rides, these options are not as likely as finding fish in a market. Refrigerators are also not a likely option as they are used for storing fish that has already been caught or purchased."}}
{"Q": "What are people likely to want to do with their friends?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) own land (B) own home (C) talk to each other (D) believe in god (E) spend time", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. spend time.\nExplanation: People are social creatures and enjoy spending time with their friends. This can involve a variety of activities such as going out to eat, watching movies, playing sports, or simply hanging out and talking. While owning land or a home may be important to some people, it is not necessarily something that they would want to do with their friends. Similarly, while belief in god may be a shared interest among some friends, it is not a universal desire. Talking to each other is certainly a common activity among friends, but it is often done in conjunction with other activities rather than being the sole focus. Therefore, spending time with friends is the most plausible answer."}}

Cabinet.\nExplanation: After drinking from a glass, it is common practice to put it in a cabinet or on a shelf designated for glassware. This keeps the glass clean and easily accessible for future use. The ocean and water cooler are not appropriate places to put a glass, as they are not designed for storing glassware. The dishwasher is a good option for cleaning the glass, but it is not the best place to store it. The dining room may be a suitable location for storing glassware, but it is not as specific as the cabinet."}}

The options of train station and beach are less likely as they are not typically associated with cheap travel. The option of stumblebum is not a location and does not make sense in the context. The option of bridge is also unlikely as it is not a common place for people to ask for change or a ticket. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C. bus depot, where people often wait to board buses and may ask for change or a ticket to afford the fare."}}

(C) enjoying (D) injury (E) enjoyment", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. injury.\n\nExplanation: Since Joe was hit by a ball and fell down, it is more plausible that he got injured rather than experiencing anger, good natured ribbing, enjoyment, or any other emotion. It is important to seek medical attention if someone gets hit by a ball and falls down to ensure that they are not seriously injured."}}

The envelope is addressed with the recipient's name and address, as well as the sender's return address, and is then taken to the post office to be mailed. While words and the English alphabet are obviously used in the letter itself, the physical container for the letter is the envelope."}}
{"Q": "Joe owned back taxes as well as what other type of taxes?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) anterior (B) front (C) main (D) front (E) current", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (E) current\nExplanation: The word \"back\" in \"back taxes\" implies that Joe owed taxes from a previous period. Therefore, the other type of taxes he owed would be current taxes, which are due for the current period.

A counter would be a more plausible answer as it could be a book about the process of writing the book itself, or a book that includes commentary on its own structure and content. A coffee table, school room, backpack, or bedside table would not be as relevant or logical choices for the subject matter of a self-referential book."}}
{"Q": "Of all the sports, Billy enjoys football, but what does his concerned mother think of the sport?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) very entertaining (B) fun (C) slow (D) competitive (E) violent", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. violent\nExplanation: The question states that Billy enjoys football, but his mother is concerned about the sport. The most plausible reason for a mother to be concerned about football is its reputation for being a violent sport, with a high risk of injury.

Therefore, it is likely that she always double checked her own safety measures or the safety of her surroundings. Option B, \"secure,\" is also a possibility, but it is less specific than \"safety.\" Option A, \"fight enemy,\" and option E, \"vicinity,\" are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Option C, \"being safe,\" is redundant with option D, \"safety.\""}}

The sentence suggests that the parents loved that the back yard was safe, which implies that the neighborhood itself was also safe. Therefore, option B, neighborhood, is the most plausible answer. Option A, suburb, is not specific enough to indicate safety, and options C, D, and E are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "While people just throw coins down them now, what originally had a pail to be lowered for it's intended use?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) garage (B) utility room (C) slide (D) wishing well (E) garden", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. wishing well\nExplanation: Wishing wells were originally constructed with a pail or bucket that could be lowered into the well to retrieve water. The tradition of throwing coins into the well for good luck or to make a wish likely developed later on."}}
{"Q": "Joe was thrown from his boat into the water.  The water was cold because it was the middle of winter and he cried out to his crew for help.  They couldn't hear him over the sound of the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) surface of earth (B) teardrops (C) snowflake (D) typhoon (E) motor", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is E, motor, as it is common for boats to have loud motors that can make it difficult to hear someone calling out for help. The other options, such as surface of earth, teardrops, snowflake, and typhoon, do not make sense in the context of the situation and are unlikely to drown out someone's cries for help."}}
{"Q": "When a human is earning money, where are they often found?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) deep thought (B) park (C) friend's house (D) place of work (E) school", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. place of work.\nExplanation: When a human is earning money, they are most likely found at their place of work. This is where they perform tasks or provide services in exchange for payment. While they may occasionally think deeply about their work or take breaks in a park, the primary location for earning money is the workplace. It is unlikely that they would be at a friend's house or school while actively earning money."}}
{"Q": "They passed a apple tree on their way to the racetrack, the were going to watch the biggest motorsport spectacle in the world where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) maryland (B) indiana (C) on tv (D) park (E) new jersey", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Indiana.\nExplanation: The question mentions that they were on their way to watch the biggest motorsport spectacle in the world, which is likely referring to the Indianapolis 500, held annually in Indiana. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "Why do people play chess on the weekends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) satisfaction (B) have fun (C) thrilling (D) made (E) smart", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. have fun\nExplanation: People play chess on the weekends because it is a fun and engaging activity that challenges their strategic thinking skills. While some may find it satisfying or thrilling, the primary reason for playing is to enjoy the game and socialize with others who share the same interest. Additionally, playing chess can also help improve cognitive abilities and promote mental wellness."}}
{"Q": "What do you need energy to do in gym class?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) work (B) tacos (C) mass (D) play sports (E) wrestle", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. play sports\nExplanation: In gym class, students typically engage in physical activities such as playing sports, running, jumping, and other exercises that require energy. Without sufficient energy, it would be difficult to participate in these activities and perform well. Tacos and mass are not related to gym class, and while wrestling does require energy, it is not the only activity in gym class. Therefore, option D is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sarah dropped the marble because she wanted to do what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) game (B) pouch (C) home (D) store (E) jar", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. game\nExplanation: The word \"dropped\" implies that Sarah was playing with the marble, and the most likely reason for her to drop it would be because she was playing a game with it. The other options (pouch, home, store, jar) do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "We are all human, and we all what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) write (B) eat cake (C) smile (D) think critically (E) die", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. smile\nExplanation: Smiling is a universal human expression that is often associated with happiness, joy, and contentment. It is a natural response to positive emotions and can also be used to convey friendliness and approachability. While not all humans may write, eat cake, think critically, or even die (such as infants), smiling is a common experience that is shared by people of all ages and cultures."}}
{"Q": "If a person were going to bed, what would be their goal?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) lazy (B) insomnia (C) rest (D) falling asleep (E) dreaming of", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. rest.\nExplanation: When a person goes to bed, their goal is typically to rest and recharge their body and mind for the next day. While some people may struggle with insomnia and have difficulty falling asleep, the ultimate goal is still to achieve a state of rest and relaxation. Choosing option A, lazy, or option E, dreaming of, may not accurately reflect the primary goal of going to bed."}}
{"Q": "What are candles good for eliminating?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) shelf (B) board (C) church (D) table (E) dark", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. dark\nExplanation: Candles are often used to eliminate darkness by providing light. They are not typically used for eliminating shelves, boards, churches, or tables."}}
{"Q": "WHat leads to an early death?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) poisonous gas (B) homicide (C) cinder (D) nuclear weapons (E) cyanide", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Homicide.\nExplanation: Homicide, or being killed by another person, is a more plausible answer for leading to an early death as it is a common cause of death worldwide. Poisonous gas, cinder, nuclear weapons, and cyanide are all deadly, but they are not as common as homicide."}}
{"Q": "What room would you find many bookcases and is used for contemplation?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) study (B) house (C) homw (D) kitchen (E) den", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. study\nExplanation: A study is a room specifically designed for reading, writing, and contemplation. It is common to have many bookcases in a study, as it is a space dedicated to intellectual pursuits. The other options, such as house, home, kitchen, and den, are not specific rooms and do not typically have a large number of bookcases or serve as spaces for contemplation."}}
{"Q": "Where do you head to travel to a star?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) night sky (B) galaxy (C) outer space (D) hollywood (E) eat cake", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. outer space\nExplanation: Stars are located in outer space, which is the vast expanse beyond the Earth's atmosphere. To travel to a star, one would need to leave the Earth and venture into outer space. The night sky and galaxy are both visible from Earth, but they are not physical locations that one can travel to. Hollywood and eating cake are unrelated to space travel."}}
{"Q": "The player lifted his cornet and walked in rhythm, what was the player a member of?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) museum (B) high school band (C) marching band (D) orchestra (E) band", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. marching band\nExplanation: The phrase \"walked in rhythm\" suggests that the player is likely part of a group that moves in a coordinated way while playing music, such as a marching band. The other options, such as a museum or orchestra, do not typically involve walking or moving in a rhythmic manner while playing an instrument. High school band and band are possible options, but marching band is a more specific and likely choice given the context."}}
{"Q": "What happens at soon as a living being is born?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) expiration (B) growing older (C) sometimes bad (D) death (E) start reproduction", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Growing older.\nExplanation: As soon as a living being is born, it starts to grow and develop. This process of growth and development continues throughout the lifespan of the organism until it reaches maturity. While death is an inevitable part of life, it does not happen immediately after birth. Similarly, reproduction may not occur until the organism reaches sexual maturity, which can take years. While some aspects of life may be difficult or challenging, such as illness or injury, it is not accurate to say that they are always bad. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that a living being starts growing older as soon as it is born."}}
{"Q": "When someone is talking and you missed something, what can you do to get them to repeat it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) walking (B) ask question (C) think (D) write question in crayon (E) sneeze", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Ask question.\nExplanation: The most appropriate and effective way to get someone to repeat what they said is to simply ask them to repeat it. This shows that you are actively listening and engaged in the conversation. Walking, thinking, writing in crayon, or sneezing are not effective ways to communicate that you missed something and need it repeated."}}
{"Q": "Where does one store fabric in their own home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sewing room (B) clothing store (C) tailor shop (D) clothes store (E) cotton mill", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. sewing room\nExplanation: Fabric is typically stored in a sewing room, as this is where most people keep their sewing supplies and equipment. A sewing room is a dedicated space for sewing and crafting, and it usually contains shelves, cabinets, and other storage solutions for fabric, thread, patterns, and other sewing materials. While fabric may also be stored in a tailor shop or clothing store, these locations are not typically found in one's own home. A cotton mill is a manufacturing facility where raw cotton is processed into fabric, so it is not a suitable location for storing fabric in one's home."}}
{"Q": "What do most companies not want to have relative to demand?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) oversupply (B) plentitude (C) stockpile (D) superabundance (E) busy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. oversupply\n\nExplanation: Most companies do not want to have an oversupply relative to demand because it can lead to excess inventory, increased storage costs, and potential losses due to spoilage or obsolescence. It can also result in price reductions to move excess inventory, which can negatively impact profit margins. Therefore, companies aim to balance their supply with demand to optimize their operations and profitability."}}
{"Q": "What is happening while he's playing basketball for such a long time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sweating (B) pain (C) having fun (D) medium (E) knee injury", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) sweating\nExplanation: When playing basketball for a long time, it is natural for the body to sweat as it is a physical activity that requires a lot of movement and energy. Sweating helps regulate body temperature and prevent overheating. While pain or knee injury may occur during basketball, it is not necessarily happening just because he is playing for a long time. Having fun is also a possibility, but it is not a physical occurrence like sweating. Therefore, sweating is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A traveler laments the fact that mass transit is limited in his city when his groceries get soaked by the rain as he waits where?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bus stop (B) library (C) motel (D) airport (E) subway", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. bus stop\n\nExplanation: The fact that the traveler is waiting for mass transit suggests that he is likely at a bus stop. Additionally, the mention of rain implies that he is outdoors, which further supports the idea that he is waiting for a bus rather than being inside a library, motel, airport, or subway."}}
{"Q": "The person was in physical distress, where should he go?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) synagogue (B) for help (C) hospital (D) bus stop (E) building", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. hospital.\nExplanation: If someone is in physical distress, the best place to go is a hospital where they can receive medical attention and treatment. A synagogue, bus stop, or building would not provide the necessary medical care. Going for help is a vague option and may not lead to immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C. hospital."}}
{"Q": "The cancer patient was expecting to die, so he made out his what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) not to live (B) write will (C) never want (D) seek help (E) go to hell", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. write will.\nExplanation: When someone is expecting to die, it is common for them to make a will, which is a legal document that outlines how their assets and possessions will be distributed after their death. This ensures that their wishes are carried out and their loved ones are taken care of. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Options A, C, D, and E are not relevant or appropriate in this context."}}
{"Q": "There was a toll road that meandered from Maine to New Hampshire, where was it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) massachusetts (B) new england (C) my house (D) new jersey (E) connecticut", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Connecticut.\nExplanation: The toll road that meandered from Maine to New Hampshire is most likely the Connecticut Turnpike, which runs from the Massachusetts border to the New York border, passing through Connecticut. The other options, such as Massachusetts, New England, My House, and New Jersey, are not plausible as they are either too broad or not geographically connected to Maine and New Hampshire."}}
{"Q": "If you partied all night you could find yourself already what, even when just beginning work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) getting tired (B) working (C) procrastination (D) jumping (E) sitting down", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. getting tired.\nExplanation: Partying all night can lead to lack of sleep and exhaustion, which can make a person feel tired even when they are just beginning work. This can affect their productivity and ability to focus on their tasks. It is important to get enough rest and avoid excessive partying to maintain good health and work performance."}}
{"Q": "The cat carefully navigated the area, they do everything they can to avoid what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) get wet (B) eat vegetables (C) falling (D) wool sweater (E) sharp claws", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. falling.\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the cat is being cautious and careful while navigating the area, which implies that there might be some obstacles or dangers around. Out of the given options, falling seems to be the most plausible one as it is a common hazard for cats, especially if they are climbing or jumping on high surfaces. The other options, such as getting wet, eating vegetables, or wearing a wool sweater, do not seem to fit the context of the sentence. Sharp claws could be a danger, but the sentence implies that the cat is trying to avoid something, not causing harm to others. Therefore, option C, falling, is the most logical choice."}}
{"Q": "What is someone usually doing if someone else is talking to him or her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) listening (B) language (C) looking at eyes (D) planning the perfect murder (E) voice", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. listening.\nExplanation: When someone else is talking to us, we are usually expected to listen to what they are saying. Listening involves paying attention to the speaker's words, tone, and body language, and trying to understand their message. It is an important communication skill that helps us build relationships, solve problems, and learn new things. While language, looking at eyes, and voice are all important aspects of communication, they are not necessarily the primary focus when someone is talking to us. Planning the perfect murder is obviously not an appropriate or plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What does the sky do before a rain?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) appear beautiful (B) appear blue (C) shows a rainbow (D) rain water (E) cloud over", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. cloud over\nExplanation: Before a rain, the sky usually becomes cloudy and overcast as the moisture in the air condenses into visible water droplets. This can cause the sky to appear gray or even dark, signaling that rain is likely to occur. While rainbows can sometimes appear after a rain, they are not a reliable indicator of impending precipitation. Similarly, while the sky can be beautiful or blue on a clear day, these conditions are not typically associated with rain. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the sky will cloud over before a rain."}}
{"Q": "Pens, computers, text books and paper clips can all be found where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) desktop (B) university (C) drawer (D) table (E) work", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. drawer\nExplanation: Pens, computers, textbooks, and paper clips are all common office or school supplies that are typically stored in a drawer. While they may also be found on a desktop, table, or at work, the most likely place to find all of these items together is in a drawer."}}
{"Q": "What geographic area is a lizard likely to be?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) ball stopped (B) west texas (C) arid regions (D) garden (E) warm place", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Arid regions.\n\nExplanation: Lizards are cold-blooded animals that require warmth to regulate their body temperature. Arid regions, such as deserts, provide the warm and dry environment that lizards need to survive. Lizards are also commonly found in rocky areas, where they can bask in the sun and hide in crevices for protection. While lizards can be found in gardens and warm places, the most likely geographic area for a lizard to be is in an arid region."}}
{"Q": "What do you use to carry your briefcase?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) office building (B) school (C) courtroom (D) airport (E) hand", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. hand\nExplanation: It is common for individuals to carry their own briefcase by hand, especially when traveling to and from work or meetings. While some may use a rolling briefcase or shoulder strap, the most plausible answer is carrying it by hand. The other options (office building, school, courtroom, airport) are locations where one may use a briefcase, but they do not relate to the method of carrying it."}}
{"Q": "He picked up his pace to a run, he wanted to do what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) learn to walk (B) frightened (C) get away from (D) exercise (E) go faster", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. get away from\nExplanation: The phrase \"picked up his pace to a run\" suggests that the person is trying to move quickly and escape from something or someone. This makes option C, \"get away from,\" the most plausible answer. Options A and D are unlikely because they suggest the person is trying to learn to walk or exercise, which doesn't fit the context. Option B is possible, but there is no indication in the sentence that the person is frightened. Option E is also possible, but it doesn't provide a clear reason for why the person is running."}}
{"Q": "What would a person do if they do not have any friends?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) talk to people (B) try again (C) fall asleep (D) stand alone (E) thank god", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. talk to people.\nExplanation: If a person does not have any friends, the best way to make new friends is to talk to people. They can join clubs or groups that interest them, attend social events, or even strike up conversations with people they meet in everyday situations like at work or in a coffee shop. It may take some effort and courage, but putting oneself out there and being open to meeting new people is the first step towards making friends."}}
{"Q": "As a result of dying, what happens to organic material?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) change of color (B) stop breathing (C) wake up (D) death and decay (E) getting cold", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Death and decay.\n\nExplanation: When an organism dies, its organic material begins to break down through the process of decay. This involves the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones, which can be used by other organisms as nutrients. Decay is facilitated by the activity of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, which consume the organic material and release carbon dioxide and other byproducts. Over time, the organic material will decompose and eventually disappear, leaving behind only inorganic matter such as minerals and salts. This process is an important part of the natural cycle of life and death, as it allows nutrients to be recycled and reused by other living organisms."}}
{"Q": "What does everyone have in relation to other people?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) feelings (B) food (C) unique personality (D) different standards (E) values", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. different standards.\n\nExplanation: Everyone has different standards in relation to other people. This can be seen in various aspects of life such as work, relationships, and personal beliefs. Each individual has their own set of values and expectations, which can differ from those of others. This can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, but it also allows for diversity and individuality."}}
{"Q": "What do you ask a child to do when you first meet her?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) ask questions (B) count to ten (C) costume (D) state name (E) dress herself", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. State name.\nExplanation: When meeting a child for the first time, it is appropriate to ask them to state their name. This helps establish a connection and allows for proper introductions. Asking questions or counting to ten may be overwhelming or confusing for the child, and asking them to dress themselves or wear a costume is not necessary or appropriate in a first meeting."}}
{"Q": "Where can you buy a clock, clothing and wrenches?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) counter (B) train station (C) school room (D) desk (E) department store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. department store\nExplanation: A department store typically sells a wide variety of products, including clocks, clothing, and tools such as wrenches. It is a more plausible option compared to the other choices, which are unlikely to sell all three items together."}}
{"Q": "What do you do when you're in a new place and want to see new things?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) interesting (B) look around (C) take pictures (D) change of surroundings (E) new experience", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Look around.\nExplanation: When you're in a new place and want to see new things, the most plausible thing to do is to look around. This allows you to take in your surroundings, observe the people and culture, and discover interesting sights and landmarks. By looking around, you can also get a sense of the layout of the place and find your way around more easily. While taking pictures and seeking new experiences are also valid options, they may not be the most practical or effective ways to explore a new place."}}
{"Q": "What happens when to ice when it is in the sun?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) carved (B) melted (C) ice cream (D) antarctica (E) sculptured", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. melted.\nExplanation: When ice is exposed to the sun, it absorbs heat and begins to melt. This is because the sun's rays provide energy that causes the ice molecules to vibrate and break apart, turning the solid ice into liquid water. Therefore, option B, melted, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where can you store your dishes in your dwelling?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) drawer (B) shelf (C) pantry (D) apartment (E) cabinet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Cabinet\nExplanation: Cabinets are specifically designed for storing dishes and are commonly found in kitchens. Drawers are more commonly used for utensils and pantry is typically used for storing food items. Shelves can also be used for storing dishes, but they may not provide as much protection as a cabinet with doors. An apartment is a type of dwelling and not a specific storage option for dishes."}}
{"Q": "The man laid on the soft moss and looked up at the trees, where was the man?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) niagra falls (B) forest (C) waterfall (D) ground (E) tree", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. forest\nExplanation: The description of the man laying on soft moss and looking up at trees suggests that he is in a forest. Niagara Falls and waterfalls in general are not typically associated with soft moss and trees, and it would be unlikely for someone to lay on the ground and look up at a tree if they were already in a tree. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the man is in a forest."}}
{"Q": "What is someone doing if he or she is sitting quietly and his or her eyes are moving?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) reading (B) meditate (C) fall asleep (D) bunk (E) think", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. think\nExplanation: If someone is sitting quietly and their eyes are moving, it is likely that they are lost in thought or daydreaming. This is a common behavior when someone is deep in thought or trying to solve a problem. While reading or meditating may involve sitting quietly, they typically do not involve eye movement. Falling asleep or bunking would involve closing the eyes, not moving them."}}
{"Q": "Where can I find a stapler in many places?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) desk drawer (B) office building (C) manual (D) office supply store (E) desktop", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. office supply store\nExplanation: While a stapler may be found in a desk drawer or on a desktop, these options are not guaranteed to be available in many places. An office building may have multiple staplers, but it is not a reliable source for finding one. A manual would not provide a physical stapler. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D, an office supply store, as they are specifically designed to provide a variety of office supplies, including staplers, in many locations."}}
{"Q": "A man takes a seat at a museum outside of Barcelona, where is he likely?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) in cinema (B) martorell (C) falling down (D) show (E) airplane", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Martorell.\nExplanation: Martorell is a town located outside of Barcelona, known for its historical and cultural attractions, including museums. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man is sitting at a museum in Martorell rather than in a cinema, falling down, at a show, or on an airplane."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a toy soldier that is being played with?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) toy box (B) movies (C) child's hand (D) toybos (E) child park", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Toy box.\nExplanation: A toy soldier that is being played with is most likely to be found in a child's toy box. This is where children usually keep their toys when they are not playing with them. It is also the first place they would look for a toy soldier when they want to play with it again. While a child's hand is also a possible location, it is not a specific place where the toy soldier would be found when not in use. The other options, such as movies and child park, are not likely places to find a toy soldier being played with."}}
{"Q": "Where are you when you're about to use your plane ticket?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pocket (B) terrorists hands (C) airport (D) sea ship (E) briefcase", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. airport.\nExplanation: When you have a plane ticket, you are most likely at the airport, where you will check in, go through security, and board your flight. The other options, such as having it in your pocket or briefcase, are possible, but they do not necessarily indicate that you are about to use the ticket. The option of it being in the hands of terrorists is not a plausible scenario and the option of being on a sea ship is also unlikely as plane tickets are used for air travel."}}
{"Q": "Flowers make a good center focal point, just one of many arrangements that look good on a what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) market (B) table (C) countryside (D) anthology (E) vase", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Flowers are often used as a centerpiece on a table, whether it's a dining table, coffee table, or side table. They add color and beauty to the space and can be arranged in various ways to create different moods and styles. While flowers can also be displayed in a vase, the question is asking for the arrangement that looks good on something, and a vase is not a surface or object that can be decorated with flowers. The other options, such as market, countryside, and anthology, do not make sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "How can a human cross a river and not mess up their hair?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) wisconsin (B) waterfall (C) hatred (D) bridge (E) valley", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. bridge\nExplanation: Crossing a river using a bridge would not require a person to get their hair wet or messy. They can simply walk across the bridge without any risk of getting wet or messing up their hair. The other options, such as Wisconsin, waterfall, and valley, do not provide any feasible solution for crossing a river without messing up one's hair. Hatred is not related to the question at all."}}
{"Q": "Batman bought beer.  There were no bottles available.  He had to settle for what?.", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) shelf (B) soccer game (C) keg (D) can (E) refrigerator", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Since there were no bottles available, Batman would have had to settle for cans of beer. Cans are a common alternative to bottles and are often found in stores and at events where alcohol is served. A keg would be too large for a single person to purchase and carry, and it is unlikely that beer would be stored on a shelf or in a refrigerator without any bottles available. A soccer game is also an unlikely location for purchasing beer, as it is typically sold at concession stands or in designated areas."}}
{"Q": "You can find a monkey in what West African region on the Gulf of Guinea", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) south american country (B) rain forest (C) pay debts (D) works (E) nigeria", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Rain forest.\nExplanation: Monkeys are commonly found in rain forests, which are abundant in West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea. These forests provide a suitable habitat for various species of monkeys, including the colobus monkey, the mandrill, and the chimpanzee. Therefore, it is more plausible to choose option B as the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "Surprising an angry person could lead to what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) humor (B) fight (C) jocose (D) laughter (E) accidents", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. fight.\n\nExplanation: Surprising an angry person can trigger their fight or flight response, and in some cases, it can lead to physical aggression and violence. It is important to approach angry individuals with caution and try to de-escalate the situation rather than surprising them."}}
{"Q": "Where is a dining area likely to be small?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) cruise ship (B) home (C) mall (D) restaurant (E) dark cave", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. cruise ship\n\nExplanation: Dining areas on cruise ships are often small due to limited space on the ship. Cruise ships have to accommodate a large number of passengers, so the dining areas are designed to be compact and efficient. In contrast, homes, malls, and restaurants typically have larger dining areas to accommodate more people and provide a comfortable dining experience. A dark cave is not a plausible option for a dining area as it is not a suitable environment for dining."}}
{"Q": "Killing people should not cause what emotion?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) vengeance (B) going to prison (C) joy (D) afraid (E) terrible", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Joy is not an appropriate emotion to feel when killing someone. Taking another person's life is a serious and tragic act that should not be celebrated or enjoyed. It is important to recognize the value of human life and the devastating impact that violence can have on individuals and communities. Instead, we should strive to promote peace, empathy, and understanding in our interactions with others."}}
{"Q": "James slamed into someone playing football, and not for the first time.  He was concerned about the consequences of many what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) exhilaration (B) interactions (C) head injuries (D) death (E) having fun", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. head injuries\nExplanation: The context suggests that James has collided with someone while playing football multiple times, which could lead to head injuries. The other options, such as exhilaration, having fun, interactions, and death, do not fit the context as well as head injuries."}}
{"Q": "More people should lower the guard and just have fun, we don't got long just what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) enjoy living (B) happy (C) enjoyable (D) get laid (E) do enjoy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. enjoy living.\nExplanation: This answer is the most plausible because it aligns with the idea of living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment. It suggests that people should let go of their inhibitions and have fun without worrying too much about the consequences. It also implies that life is short and we should make the most of it by enjoying it to the fullest. The other options, such as \"get laid\" or \"do enjoy,\" are not as appropriate because they focus on specific activities rather than the overall idea of enjoying life."}}
{"Q": "Where can you get a lizard to keep in your home?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) desert country (B) dessert (C) pet shop (D) tropical areas (E) zoo", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. pet shop\nExplanation: Pet shops are a common place to purchase lizards as pets. They are bred in captivity and sold to individuals who want to keep them as pets. While lizards can be found in desert and tropical areas, it is not recommended to take them from the wild as it can harm their natural habitats and populations. Zoos also do not typically sell animals to individuals for personal ownership. Therefore, a pet shop is the most plausible option for obtaining a pet lizard."}}
{"Q": "What would use a musical instrument?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) guitar (B) music room (C) orchestra (D) case (E) movie", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A guitar.\nExplanation: A guitar is a musical instrument that can be played by strumming or plucking its strings.

While it is possible for some couples to work through infidelity and rebuild their relationship, it is more common for the betrayed spouse to file for divorce. Therefore, option E, divorce, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What is the most famous constellation out of earth?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) one moon (B) milky way (C) god's creation (D) stars (E) universe", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Milky Way.\nExplanation: The Milky Way is not a constellation, but rather a galaxy that contains our solar system and billions of other stars. It is the most famous galaxy in the universe and can be seen from Earth as a band of light in the night sky."}}
{"Q": "If a reception is held with hotel guests walking by, what is the likely venue?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) room service (B) church basement (C) lobby (D) large room (E) country club", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. lobby\nExplanation: Holding a reception in a hotel lobby is a common practice, especially for smaller events. It allows hotel guests to easily join in and mingle with the event attendees. Additionally, the lobby provides a central location for guests to gather and socialize. Rooms service would not be a suitable venue for a reception, as it is typically used for in-room dining. A church basement would not be a likely venue for a hotel reception. A large room or country club could be possible venues, but the lobby is a more plausible option given the context of hotel guests walking by."}}
{"Q": "What is a place that is far away from your house and where you could consume beer?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) refrigerator (B) friend's house (C) keg (D) neighbor's house (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Friend's house.\nExplanation: A friend's house is a plausible option for a place that is far away from your house and where you could consume beer. It is a social setting where you can enjoy a drink with friends and is a common location for gatherings and parties. The other options, such as the refrigerator, kitchen, and neighbor's house, are not typically considered as places to consume beer away from home. The keg could be an option if you are hosting a party, but it is not a location in itself."}}
{"Q": "If a court case is dismissed after hearing testimony, what would be a likely cause?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) change of heart (B) anguish (C) anger (D) boredom (E) anxiety", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) change of heart\nExplanation: If a court case is dismissed after hearing testimony, it is likely that the judge or jury had a change of heart and decided that the evidence presented was not sufficient to support the case. This could be due to inconsistencies in the testimony, lack of credible witnesses, or other factors that cast doubt on the case. Anguish, anger, boredom, and anxiety are unlikely causes for a case to be dismissed, as they do not relate to the legal merits of the case."}}
{"Q": "Sitting down quickly after eating beans could lead to what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) flatulence (B) happiness (C) laziness (D) fall asleep (E) comfort", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. flatulence\nExplanation: Beans contain complex sugars that are difficult for the body to break down, leading to the production of gas in the digestive system. Sitting down quickly after eating beans can cause the gas to build up and result in flatulence."}}
{"Q": "John was my neighbor, it was easy to talk to him. He was never what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) away (B) distant (C) remote person (D) bore (E) foe", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The word \"distant\" means reserved or aloof in manner, which is the opposite of being easy to talk to. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A, \"away,\" does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Option C, \"remote person,\" is redundant and does not add any new information. Option D, \"bore,\" is not supported by the sentence and is a subjective judgment. Option E, \"foe,\" is also not supported by the sentence and is an extreme and unlikely possibility."}}
{"Q": "Where do people want to have a lot of coffee?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) table (B) office (C) desk (D) kitchen (E) ocean", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. kitchen\nExplanation: The kitchen is a common place for people to have coffee as it is where the coffee maker is usually located and it is a convenient place to prepare and enjoy a cup of coffee. Additionally, many people enjoy having coffee in the morning as part of their daily routine, and the kitchen is often the first place they go to start their day. While people may enjoy coffee at a table or desk, these locations are not as commonly associated with coffee consumption as the kitchen. The office may also be a common place for coffee consumption, but it is not as specific as the kitchen. The ocean is not a plausible answer as it is not a practical location for coffee consumption."}}
{"Q": "You stop and have food all around you, what are you?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) stay alive (B) wanted to survive (C) nutrition (D) grew (E) full", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Nutrition.\nExplanation: When you stop and have food all around you, it means that you have access to sources of nutrition. Nutrition is essential for the body to function properly and to stay healthy. Therefore, choosing option C, nutrition, is the most plausible answer. Options A, B, D, and E are not as relevant or specific to the situation described."}}
{"Q": "James was meeting a friend.  They had planed a slow day. They didn't want to do much.  They just wanted what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) relaxation (B) panic (C) alarm (D) joy (E) cheer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The word \"slow\" implies a lack of urgency or activity, which suggests that James and his friend were looking for a day of relaxation rather than panic, alarm, joy, or cheer."}}
{"Q": "The car's steering seem quite loose, but he still considered purchasing it because he needed something small and what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) sturdy (B) faithful (C) bound (D) compact (E) packaged", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. compact\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the person needs something small, which suggests that they are looking for a car that is not too big or bulky. The fact that the steering seems loose may be a concern, but it does not necessarily mean that the car is not suitable for their needs. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D. compact, as it aligns with the person's requirement for a small car."}}
{"Q": "Dan was a farmer with just one heifer.  But that was okay, he only kept her for milk, and he didn't think he'd find good farmland in a place as cold as where?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) arizona (B) farm yard (C) michigan (D) german field (E) dairy farm", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Michigan.\nExplanation: Michigan is known for its cold climate, especially during the winter months. It is also a state with a strong agricultural industry, making it a plausible location for a farmer like Dan to have his one heifer for milk. Arizona, on the other hand, is known for its hot and dry climate, making it less likely for a farmer to keep a heifer for milk. A farm yard or dairy farm are not specific locations and do not provide enough context to determine the plausibility of Dan's situation. German field is also not a plausible location as it does not provide any context or information about the climate or agricultural industry in that area."}}
{"Q": "It's Friday night and Alice puts off going to bed because she plans on doing what Saturday?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) hatred (B) sleeping in (C) rest (D) making love (E) insomnia", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Sleeping in.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (B) sleeping in because Alice is putting off going to bed on Friday night, indicating that she wants to stay up late and sleep in the next morning. The other options, such as (A) hatred, (C) rest, and (E) insomnia, do not make sense in this context. (D) making love is a possibility, but there is no indication in the question that Alice has a partner or plans to engage in sexual activity."}}
{"Q": "His phone was dead and they couldn't find the expressway, he opened up the glove compartment and handed his passenger the what to navigate?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) eastern united states (B) michigan (C) map (D) choppers (E) american city", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. map.\nExplanation: Given the context of the sentence, it is most likely that the driver handed his passenger a map to navigate since they couldn't find the expressway and his phone was dead. The other options, such as eastern United States, Michigan, choppers, and American city, do not make sense in this context and are not relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "What would someone use a personal key for?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) car stand (B) at hotel (C) own home (D) front door (E) bus depot", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. front door\nExplanation: A personal key is typically used to unlock and secure the front door of one's own home or apartment. It is not commonly used at a car stand, hotel, or bus depot."}}
{"Q": "The cat kept pestering it's owner, it was that time of the day and it was what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) litter tray (B) whiskers (C) hungry (D) feline (E) thirsty", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. hungry\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the cat is bothering its owner, which is a common behavior of cats when they are hungry. It is also mentioned that it is \"that time of the day,\" which could be the cat's regular feeding time. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cat is pestering its owner because it is hungry."}}
{"Q": "Her voice lent her to the alto section, what group did she join?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) symphony (B) concerto (C) choir (D) theater troupe (E) marching band", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. choir.\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person has a lower-pitched voice, which is typical of an alto. In a choir, the alto section is responsible for singing the lower harmonies, so it would be the most appropriate group for someone with this vocal range. The other options, such as symphony, concerto, theater troupe, or marching band, do not necessarily require a specific vocal range and would not be as relevant to the person's voice type."}}
{"Q": "Where are you likely to find a Japanese restaurant not run by people from Japan?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) california (B) downtown (C) large town (D) tokio (E) china town", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) California\nExplanation: California has a large population of Japanese Americans and a strong Japanese cultural influence, making it a likely location for a Japanese restaurant not run by people from Japan. Downtown areas and large towns may also have Japanese restaurants, but they could still be run by people from Japan. Tokyo is in Japan, so it would not be a location for a Japanese restaurant not run by people from Japan. Chinatown areas typically have Chinese restaurants, not Japanese ones."}}
{"Q": "Animals who have hair and don't lay eggs are what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) reproduce asexually (B) males (C) mammals (D) attack (E) ocean", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. mammals\nExplanation: Mammals are a class of animals that have hair or fur, produce milk to feed their young, and give birth to live young instead of laying eggs. This distinguishes them from other classes of animals such as birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "John was an aristocratic fox hunter.  Where might he live?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) england (B) new hampshire (C) street (D) arkansas (E) north dakota", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. England.\nExplanation: Fox hunting is a traditional sport in England, particularly among the aristocracy. It is unlikely that John, an aristocratic fox hunter, would live in New Hampshire, Street, Arkansas, or North Dakota, where fox hunting is not a common activity. Therefore, England is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where is a grape likely to be being fed to someone else?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) field (B) bathroom (C) michigan (D) minnesota (E) painting", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. field\nExplanation: Grapes are typically grown in fields and harvested to be sold or used for consumption. It is unlikely that someone would be feeding grapes to someone else in a bathroom or while looking at a painting. Michigan and Minnesota are states and do not provide any context for where a grape might be being fed to someone else."}}
{"Q": "Some food can be stored at room temperature until you open it, then you should keep it in what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) shop (B) bookcase (C) shelf (D) refrigerators (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. refrigerators\nExplanation: Once you open certain types of food, such as dairy products, meats, and some fruits and vegetables, they should be stored in a refrigerator to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage. Keeping them at room temperature can lead to foodborne illness. Therefore, it is important to store these types of food in a refrigerator after opening."}}
{"Q": "Sam couldn't get back to sleep because of a dream he had.  It was a what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) awake (B) horror (C) dreamworker (D) reality (E) nightmare", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is E, nightmare, as the sentence suggests that Sam was unable to fall back asleep due to a disturbing dream. A nightmare is a type of dream that can cause fear, anxiety, and other negative emotions, making it difficult to go back to sleep."}}
{"Q": "If you're going to a party in a new town what are you hoping to make?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) getting drunk (B) making new friends (C) new contacts (D) doing drugs (E) set home", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) making new friends.\n\nExplanation: When going to a party in a new town, it is always a good idea to make new friends. This can help you to feel more comfortable in the new environment and also give you the opportunity to learn more about the town and its people. Making new friends can also lead to new experiences and opportunities in the future. Getting drunk or doing drugs may lead to negative consequences and should not be the main goal of attending a party. Setting home would defeat the purpose of going to a party in the first place. New contacts may be beneficial, but making new friends is a more realistic and enjoyable goal for a party."}}
{"Q": "How is riding a bike getting it to move?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) practice (B) sense of balance (C) driving (D) good balance (E) pedalling", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Pedalling\nExplanation: Riding a bike involves pedalling, which is the act of pushing the pedals with your feet to turn the wheels and move the bike forward. While practice and good balance are important for riding a bike, they are not the primary means of getting the bike to move. Similarly, driving is not applicable as it refers to operating a motor vehicle, not a bicycle."}}
{"Q": "Where does one usually keep literature?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) books and magazines (B) own home (C) kitchen (D) shelf (E) meeting", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. shelf\nExplanation: Literature, such as books and magazines, are typically kept on shelves in homes, libraries, bookstores, and other places where they can be easily accessed and organized. While some people may keep literature in other locations such as the kitchen or at meetings, these are not as common or practical as keeping them on a shelf."}}
{"Q": "WHat type of keyboard is made up of one or more pipe divisions?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) killing (B) typewriter (C) office (D) terminal (E) organ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. organ\nExplanation: An organ keyboard is made up of one or more pipe divisions. This type of keyboard is commonly found in churches and concert halls, and is used to play music on a pipe organ. The pipes are arranged in rows or ranks, and each rank produces a different tone or timbre. The organist can control the volume and tone of the music by using the various stops and pedals on the console."}}
{"Q": "The bell rang, and the congregation began to what in to the church?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) run away (B) wind instrument (C) funnel (D) blunderbuss (E) associated with telephones", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. funnel.\nExplanation: The word \"bell\" suggests that it is a church bell, which is often rung to signal the start of a church service. The word \"funnel\" means to move or gather in a specific direction, which fits the context of people entering the church for the service. The other options, such as \"run away,\" \"wind instrument,\" and \"blunderbuss,\" do not make sense in this context. \"Associated with telephones\" is also not relevant to the sentence."}}
{"Q": "James needed smooth sandpaper, but instead he got what type?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) rough (B) non smooth (C) uneven (D) plastic (E) bumpy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The question states that James needed smooth sandpaper, but instead he got what type. The most plausible answer from the given choices is (A) rough, as rough sandpaper would be the opposite of smooth. Non-smooth, uneven, plastic, and bumpy do not necessarily imply the opposite of smooth, making (A) the most logical choice."}}
{"Q": "Where would you borrow furniture if you do not have any?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) sewer (B) neighbor's house (C) apartment (D) room (E) floor", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neighbor's house.\nExplanation: Borrowing furniture from a neighbor's house is a more plausible option than borrowing from a sewer, floor, or room. It is also a more practical option than borrowing from an apartment, as apartments typically do not have spare furniture available for borrowing."}}
{"Q": "What must happen for an animal to and it's offspring to continue livng?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) death (B) flying (C) reproducing (D) food consumed (E) eventually die", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. reproducing.\n\nExplanation: In order for an animal and its offspring to continue living, the animal must reproduce to ensure the survival of its species. While food consumption is necessary for survival, it is not the only factor in ensuring the continuation of a species. Flying may be important for some animals, but it is not a requirement for survival. Death and eventual death are not factors that contribute to the continuation of a species. Therefore, reproducing is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I want my wine stored in darkness, where should it go?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) movies (B) bed (C) moon (D) vault (E) cellar", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. cellar\nExplanation: A cellar is a common place to store wine because it is typically cool, dark, and has a stable temperature. This helps to preserve the quality of the wine over time. Storing wine in a movie theater or bed would not provide the necessary conditions for proper storage, and the moon is obviously not a viable option. A vault could work, but it may not be practical or accessible for everyday use."}}
{"Q": "If I want to open a steakhouse, what should I get first?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) michigan (B) florida (C) wine (D) texas (E) building", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Building.\nExplanation: The first step in opening a steakhouse would be to secure a location or building to operate from. This would involve finding a suitable space that meets the needs of a restaurant, such as a commercial kitchen, dining area, and storage space. Once a building is secured, the owner can then focus on other important aspects such as menu development, hiring staff, and obtaining necessary licenses and permits. While factors such as location and state regulations are important, they can be addressed after a building has been secured."}}
{"Q": "Sarah didn't like to play but she didn't want to be sedentary and bored, either, so she took up what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) serious (B) longplay (C) musical (D) eat cake (E) doing nothing", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) musical\nExplanation: Since Sarah didn't like to play, it's unlikely that she would take up a serious or longplay activity. Eating cake or doing nothing would also not be productive or engaging. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that she took up a musical activity, which would provide a creative outlet and potentially be more enjoyable for her than traditional sports or games."}}
{"Q": "Joe found spiders while checking something outside.  What might that be?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cupboard (B) closet (C) storage bag (D) mail box (E) garage", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. garage\nExplanation: Spiders are commonly found in dark and secluded areas, such as garages. It is less likely for them to be found in a cupboard, closet, storage bag, or mailbox, as these are typically indoor areas that are frequently accessed by humans."}}
{"Q": "What would you do if your date does not show up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) wait for (B) bathe (C) go for haircut (D) plan revenge (E) dress nice", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Wait for.\nExplanation: If your date does not show up, the most plausible thing to do is to wait for a reasonable amount of time. Maybe they got stuck in traffic or had an emergency. It's always better to give them the benefit of the doubt and wait for them to show up or at least contact you to explain the situation. If they don't show up or contact you after a reasonable amount of time, then you can consider other options like leaving or rescheduling the date."}}
{"Q": "What did the adult do before the job interview?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) work (B) dress himself (C) marry (D) dress herself (E) drive train", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) dress himself\nExplanation: Before a job interview, it is common for an adult to take time to dress appropriately and present themselves in a professional manner. This includes choosing appropriate clothing, grooming oneself, and ensuring that they are well-prepared for the interview. While it is possible that the adult may have worked or driven a train before the interview, these activities are not necessarily related to the preparation for the interview itself. Similarly, marrying would not typically be something that an adult would do immediately before a job interview. Therefore, dressing oneself is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Most items in retail stores are what even when they are on sale?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) overpriced (B) purchase (C) expensive (D) park (E) buying", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Most items in retail stores are marked up or overpriced, which allows for the store to offer sales and discounts while still making a profit. This is a common strategy used in retail to attract customers and increase sales. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John farms anemone in what type of facility?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) michigan (B) swimming pool (C) atlantic ocean (D) nursery (E) gulf of mexico", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Nursery.\n\nExplanation: Anemones are typically grown in controlled environments such as nurseries or aquaculture facilities. It is unlikely that they would be farmed in a swimming pool or in the open ocean. Michigan and the Gulf of Mexico are also unlikely locations for anemone farming. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D. Nursery."}}
{"Q": "Brawn opened the curtains so that the sun could do what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) dry clothes (B) warm house (C) warm room (D) shine brightly (E) get dark", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. shine brightly.\nExplanation: Opening the curtains allows the sun to enter the room and shine brightly, providing natural light and warmth. It does not necessarily have anything to do with drying clothes or warming the entire house. Getting dark is the opposite of what the sun does when it rises, so option E is also not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How might releasing energy that has built up feel?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) damage (B) wonderful (C) exhaustion (D) orgasm (E) lazy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. wonderful\nExplanation: Releasing built-up energy can often feel like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders, leaving you feeling lighter and more relaxed. This can lead to a sense of euphoria and a feeling of accomplishment, which can be described as wonderful."}}
{"Q": "What would you do if you have curiosity but are blind and paralyzed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) hear news (B) analyse (C) go somewhere (D) examine thing (E) see favorite show", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Hear news\nExplanation: If someone is blind and paralyzed, it may be difficult for them to analyze or examine things or go somewhere. However, they can still satisfy their curiosity by listening to news and staying updated on current events. This can also help them stay connected to the world around them and engage in conversations with others. Therefore, hearing news is a more plausible answer in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Where might it be hard to get furniture to?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) apartment (B) loft (C) store (D) rug (E) stairs", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. stairs\nExplanation: Stairs can be narrow, steep, or have tight turns, making it difficult to maneuver large pieces of furniture. Delivery companies may charge extra fees or refuse to deliver to locations with challenging staircases. Therefore, it can be hard to get furniture to a place with difficult stairs."}}
{"Q": "A great teacher can be what when you are attending school?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) detention (B) graduate (C) follower (D) inspiration (E) boredom", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: A great teacher can be an inspiration when you are attending school. A teacher who is passionate about their subject and cares about their students can motivate and encourage them to learn and achieve their goals. They can also serve as role models and provide guidance and support, which can have a positive impact on students' academic and personal development."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get jeans and other wearable items to take home with you?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) shopping mall (B) museum (C) laundromat (D) clothing store (E) bedroom", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) clothing store\nExplanation: Clothing stores are specifically designed to sell wearable items such as jeans, shirts, and other clothing items. Shopping malls may also have clothing stores, but they offer a wider range of products. Museums and laundromats are not places where you would typically find wearable items for purchase. Bedrooms are personal spaces and not places where you would purchase clothing items. Therefore, a clothing store is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "In what substance do clouds float?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sky (B) top of mountain (C) air (D) ground level (E) outer space", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. air\nExplanation: Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets or ice crystals that are suspended in the air. They float in the atmosphere because they are less dense than the surrounding air. The air pressure and temperature at different altitudes affect the formation and movement of clouds. Therefore, clouds can be found at different heights in the atmosphere, but they always float in the air."}}
{"Q": "Where is the large area location of the empire state building?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) manhattan (B) office (C) the city (D) fifth avenue (E) new york city", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Manhattan.\nExplanation: The Empire State Building is located in Manhattan, which is one of the five boroughs of New York City. It is situated on Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets. While \"New York City\" and \"the city\" are technically correct answers, they are not as specific as \"Manhattan\" and could refer to other areas of the city. \"Office\" is not a plausible answer as it does not describe a location."}}

A toolbox and tool kit may already have a saw, but if someone needs a new one, they would have to purchase it separately. A logging camp may have saws, but it is not a typical place for someone to go to purchase a saw for personal use. An auger is a completely different tool and not related to saws."}}

Options A, entertainment, and B, falling asleep, are also possible, but they do not necessarily imply the same level of stress relief as relaxation. Option C, getting fat, and option D, crying, are unlikely to be the woman's goals, as they are not typically associated with watching television."}}

It also provides them with a controlled environment where they can receive proper care and attention from their owners. Allowing pet birds to fly freely outside can expose them to various dangers such as predators, harsh weather conditions, and getting lost. Therefore, it is recommended to keep pet birds caged in for their own safety and well-being. The other options such as slavery, caught, topfree, and prisoner are not appropriate or ethical ways to treat pet birds."}}

The options (B) concert and (A) opera both fit this description, but since the question does not mention any loud music or instruments, it is more likely that they were at an opera. Additionally, the fact that it would be dangerous to try to find their way out suggests that they were in a large, unfamiliar building, which is more likely to be an opera house than a concert hall. The options (C) basement, (D) bedroom, and (E) grand canyon are all unlikely, as they do not fit the description of a public place with seating arrangements."}}

{"Q": "Kissing is normally an activity reserved for your romantic what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) anus (B) partner (C) arousal (D) trust (E) cooperation", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. partner\nExplanation: Kissing is a physical expression of affection and intimacy between two people who are romantically involved. It is a way to show love, passion, and desire for your partner. While trust and cooperation are important aspects of a healthy relationship, they are not directly related to kissing. Arousal may be a factor in kissing, but it is not the sole purpose. Anus is not a relevant option in this context. Therefore, option B, partner, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What does a child learn to do before school?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) count to ten (B) state name (C) dress herself (D) clean room (E) socialize", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Socialize.\nExplanation: Before starting school, children typically learn how to socialize with others. This includes learning how to interact with peers, share toys, take turns, and follow basic social rules. Socialization skills are important for success in school and in life, as they help children build relationships, communicate effectively, and navigate social situations. While counting to ten, stating their name, dressing themselves, and cleaning their room are all important skills for children to learn, socialization is typically the most important skill for young children to develop before starting school."}}
{"Q": "He was getting advice for the job interview, they told him when talking to the interviewer always make what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) get tired of (B) small talk (C) eye contact (D) friendship (E) social life", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. eye contact.\n\nExplanation: Making eye contact during a job interview is important as it shows confidence, sincerity, and interest in the conversation. It also helps to establish a connection with the interviewer and can make them feel more comfortable with you as a candidate. Small talk and discussing social life or friendship may not be relevant to the job interview and could potentially distract from the main purpose of the conversation. Getting tired of the interviewer is not a desirable outcome either. Therefore, making eye contact is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "According to what book did an apple tree lead to the downfall of man?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bible (B) spain (C) harry potter (D) new york (E) woods", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Bible\nExplanation: In the book of Genesis in the Bible, it is said that God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the Garden of Eden. In the center of the garden, there was a tree of knowledge of good and evil, and God commanded them not to eat from it. However, the serpent convinced Eve to eat from the tree, and she also gave some to Adam. This act of disobedience led to their expulsion from the garden and the introduction of sin and death into the world. The fruit of the tree is not specifically mentioned as an apple in the Bible, but it has been traditionally depicted as such in art and literature."}}
{"Q": "The neighborhood had a great sense of community, there was always a crowd at the landing of the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) stairwell (B) arena (C) ocean (D) airport (E) apartment building", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. apartment building\nExplanation: The landing of an apartment building is a common area where residents can gather and socialize. It is plausible that a neighborhood with a strong sense of community would have a crowd at the landing of an apartment building. The other options, such as stairwell, arena, ocean, and airport, do not typically serve as gathering places for a neighborhood community."}}
{"Q": "What might a kind person do?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cross street (B) talk to themselves (C) open doors (D) throw away (E) study greek", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. open doors.\nExplanation: A kind person may open doors for others as a gesture of politeness and consideration. This small act of kindness can make someone's day a little easier and brighter. Crossing the street, talking to oneself, throwing away, or studying Greek may not necessarily be indicative of kindness."}}
{"Q": "What will a person do at work?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cross street (B) draw attention to themselves (C) make money (D) falling down (E) come home", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. make money.\nExplanation: The purpose of work is typically to earn a living and make money. While some jobs may involve crossing streets or drawing attention to oneself, these are not the primary objectives of most jobs. Falling down is also not a typical activity at work. Coming home is what a person does after work, not during work. Therefore, making money is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John saw a fox running along the beach and was glad to be on the east coast.  Where might he have been?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) tennessee (B) south carolina (C) louisiana (D) oklahoma (E) mountains", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. South Carolina.\nExplanation: South Carolina is located on the east coast and has beaches where foxes can be found. Tennessee, Louisiana, and Oklahoma are not located on the east coast and do not have beaches. The mountains (choice E) also do not have beaches and are not typically where foxes are found. Therefore, South Carolina is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Name a location where you would not want to find mice.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) loft (B) attic (C) bell cat (D) countryside (E) laboratory", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Laboratory.\nExplanation: A laboratory is a place where experiments and research are conducted, and the presence of mice can contaminate the results and compromise the safety of the researchers. Mice can also damage equipment and cause electrical hazards. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a sterile and controlled environment in a laboratory, making it a location where you would not want to find mice."}}
{"Q": "The man started to learn jogging, what was he hoping to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) exhaustion (B) getting in shape (C) fitness (D) injure himself (E) fatigue", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) getting in shape.\n\nExplanation: When someone starts to learn jogging, it is usually with the intention of improving their physical fitness and getting in shape. Jogging is a popular form of exercise that can help improve cardiovascular health, increase endurance, and burn calories. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man was hoping to get in shape rather than hoping to exhaust or injure himself."}}
{"Q": "Where do most people turn to get information on their phones?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) internet (B) book (C) online (D) google (E) manual", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Internet.\nExplanation: According to various studies and surveys, the majority of people turn to the internet to get information on their phones. This includes using search engines like Google, browsing websites, and accessing social media platforms. The internet provides a vast amount of information on a wide range of topics, making it a convenient and accessible source for people to turn to for information."}}
{"Q": "What happens to a body after death?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) rebirth (B) human experience (C) sadness (D) decomposition (E) obesity", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. decomposition.\nExplanation: After death, the body undergoes a process called decomposition, where the body's tissues break down and are consumed by bacteria and other organisms. This process eventually leads to the body's complete breakdown and return to the earth. Rebirth and human experience are religious or spiritual beliefs, while sadness is an emotional response to death. Obesity is a medical condition and has no relation to what happens to a body after death."}}
{"Q": "What type of non-vegetarian soup is one likely to find a potato?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) beef stew (B) own kitchen (C) clam chowder (D) kitchen cabinet (E) pantry", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. clam chowder.\n\nExplanation: Clam chowder is a type of soup that often includes potatoes as one of its ingredients. Beef stew typically includes vegetables like carrots and celery, but not necessarily potatoes. Options B, D, and E are not relevant to the question."}}
{"Q": "Though she had a disability, what did her encouraging and positive coach see in her?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) qualification (B) strength (C) pity (D) competence (E) potential", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (E) potential\nExplanation: The word \"encouraging\" suggests that the coach saw something positive in the person despite her disability. The word \"positive\" also suggests that the coach saw something that could be developed or improved upon. Therefore, it is more likely that the coach saw potential in the person rather than pity or qualification. Additionally, the word \"strength\" and \"competence\" suggest that the person already had a certain level of ability, whereas \"potential\" suggests that there is room for growth and improvement."}}
{"Q": "They had a theory of what they could do in t he big game, so over and over they would what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) park (B) practice (C) fact (D) practical (E) practise", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. practice\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the group had a plan or theory for the big game, and to execute it successfully, they repeatedly practiced it. Therefore, the most plausible answer is \"practice.\" The other options, such as \"park,\" \"fact,\" \"practical,\" and \"practise,\" do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "When you see something rise, you are where in relation to it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) sun set (B) near (C) fall (D) below (E) lower", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) below\nExplanation: When you see something rise, it means that it is moving upwards from a lower position to a higher position. Therefore, you must be below it in order to see it rise. Choices (A) and (C) are irrelevant to the question, while choices (B) and (E) do not accurately describe the observer's position in relation to the rising object."}}
{"Q": "They were getting ready for a really long hike, he put the food can in his what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cabinet (B) house (C) recycling center (D) backpack (E) make person sick", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. backpack\nExplanation: Since they were getting ready for a long hike, it would make sense for him to put the food can in his backpack, which he would be carrying with him on the hike. The other options (cabinet, house, recycling center) don't make sense in the context of preparing for a hike, and \"make person sick\" is not a place or container where the food can could be put."}}
{"Q": "Where would you keep a rug near your front door?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) persia (B) desk (C) table (D) living room (E) hall", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. hall\nExplanation: A rug near the front door is typically used to wipe off shoes and prevent dirt from being tracked into the house. The most logical place to keep it would be in the hallway, which is the area closest to the front door and where people usually take off their shoes. Keeping it in the living room, desk, or table would not serve the same purpose and would be less practical. Persia is not a location but a region known for producing high-quality rugs."}}
{"Q": "When you slip from a ladder propped on anything what will you do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) obesity (B) fall down (C) matter to (D) whatever (E) surprise", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Fall down.\nExplanation: When you slip from a ladder propped on anything, the most likely outcome is that you will fall down. This is because you will lose your balance and footing, and gravity will pull you towards the ground. It is important to always use ladders safely and securely to avoid accidents and injuries."}}
{"Q": "What do you do when you need to get food?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) table (B) disneyland (C) refrigerators (D) pantry (E) shop", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. shop\nExplanation: When you need to get food, the most plausible option is to go to a grocery store or supermarket to purchase food items. This is a common and practical solution for obtaining food. The other options, such as a table, Disneyland, refrigerators, or pantry, are not relevant or practical for obtaining food."}}
{"Q": "Brad tried to arise from bed but he could not.  Instead, he just continued to do what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) go down (B) fall down (C) lie down (D) lie to himself (E) sit down", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. lie down.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Brad tried to arise from bed but could not, which implies that he was already lying down. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that he continued to lie down. The other options (go down, fall down, sit down, lie to himself) do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "If a heifer is really high quality, you might take her where?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) home (B) dairy farm (C) cattle show (D) dairy barn (E) corral", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. cattle show.\nExplanation: If a heifer is of high quality, it means that she has desirable traits such as good genetics, health, and conformation. In order to showcase her qualities and potentially sell her for a high price, one might take her to a cattle show where judges can evaluate her against other high-quality heifers. A dairy farm or dairy barn would be more appropriate for heifers that are intended for milk production rather than for show purposes. A corral is simply a fenced area for holding livestock and does not necessarily indicate a specific purpose for the heifer. Therefore, taking a high-quality heifer to a cattle show is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What do people want to acquire from opening business?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) home (B) wealth (C) bankruptcy (D) lose money (E) get rich", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Wealth.\nExplanation: The primary goal of opening a business is to generate profits and accumulate wealth. People invest their time, money, and effort into starting a business with the expectation of earning a return on their investment. While a home may be a secondary benefit of owning a successful business, bankruptcy and losing money are not desirable outcomes. Getting rich is a common motivation for entrepreneurs, but it is important to note that success is not guaranteed and requires hard work, dedication, and a bit of luck."}}
{"Q": "What has someone who had finished their undergraduate done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) graduated (B) masters (C) postgraduate (D) phd (E) professor", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. graduated.\nExplanation: When someone finishes their undergraduate studies, they have completed their bachelor's degree and are considered a graduate. They may choose to pursue further education such as a master's degree, postgraduate studies, or a PhD, but the completion of their undergraduate degree is what qualifies them as a graduate."}}
{"Q": "Where are bus stops more common in what parts?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) ocean (B) getting off of bus (C) airport (D) urban area (E) towns", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. urban area\nExplanation: Bus stops are more common in urban areas where there is a higher population density and a greater need for public transportation. In cities, buses are often the most convenient and affordable way to get around, so there are typically more bus stops and routes available. In contrast, rural areas and small towns may have fewer bus stops and less frequent service due to lower demand and fewer resources. Therefore, option D, urban area, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Bill wanted to pick up a stranger, preferably a responsible one with kids.  Where might he look for one?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) bus station (B) paradise (C) train station (D) park (E) sea", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Bus station.\nExplanation: The bus station is a more plausible option as it is a place where people frequently travel to and from, including those with children. It is also a public place where people are likely to be waiting for transportation, making it easier for Bill to approach someone. The other options, such as paradise, sea, or park, are less likely to have responsible strangers with children readily available for Bill to pick up."}}
{"Q": "Where might a lemur frolic in the market?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) desert (B) hole (C) india (D) cage (E) rain forest", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. rain forest\nExplanation: Lemurs are native to Madagascar, which is home to rain forests. It is unlikely for a lemur to frolic in a desert or a hole, and it is unethical for them to be kept in a cage. India is not known for its lemur population. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E. rain forest."}}
{"Q": "What might I place under the furniture?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) rug (B) room (C) toy (D) friend's house (E) building", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. rug\nExplanation: Placing a rug under furniture is a common practice to protect the flooring from scratches and to add a decorative touch to the room. It also helps to anchor the furniture in place and prevent it from sliding around. Therefore, placing a rug under the furniture is a more plausible answer than the other options."}}
{"Q": "Everybody began performing once their director stated what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) fear (B) injury (C) happiness (D) action (E) cut", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. action\nExplanation: The word \"performing\" suggests that the individuals were likely actors or performers of some sort. The most logical reason for them to begin performing would be if their director gave them a cue or instruction to start, which would be an action. The other options (fear, injury, happiness, cut) do not make sense in the context of a director prompting performers to begin a performance."}}
{"Q": "By learning about the world, many poor college students gain what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pleasure (B) greater mobility (C) desire to travel (D) global warming (E) increased security", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Greater mobility.\nExplanation: By learning about the world, many poor college students gain knowledge and skills that can help them become more mobile and adaptable in different environments. This can include learning new languages, understanding different cultures, and developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. With greater mobility, these students may be better equipped to pursue job opportunities, travel, and navigate different social and economic situations."}}
{"Q": "Where are required to carry books all day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) friend's house (B) university (C) large city (D) storage (E) table", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. university\nExplanation: It is common for students to carry books all day at a university, as they attend classes, study in the library, and complete assignments throughout the day. Carrying books to a friend's house or a large city would depend on the purpose of the visit, and carrying books to storage or a table would suggest that they are not needed for immediate use. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "where is seaweed from?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) beach (B) sea (C) ocean (D) water (E) sea plant", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. sea plant\nExplanation: Seaweed is a type of marine algae that grows in the ocean. It is not found on the beach or in freshwater sources like lakes or rivers. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E, sea plant."}}
{"Q": "how can i store cooked steak?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) oven (B) freezer (C) plate (D) tupperware (E) grill", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Tupperware.\nExplanation: Cooked steak should be stored in an airtight container to prevent it from drying out or absorbing any unwanted odors from the fridge. Tupperware or any other airtight container is the best option for storing cooked steak in the fridge. Freezing is also an option, but it may affect the texture and taste of the steak when it's thawed. The oven and grill are not suitable for storing cooked steak, and storing it on a plate is not recommended as it can lead to contamination and spoilage."}}
{"Q": "John wanted to clean all of the dust out of his place before settling down to watch his favorite shows.  What might he hardest do dust?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) closet (B) under the bed (C) television (D) attic (E) most buildings", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. under the bed.\n\nExplanation: Dust tends to accumulate in hard-to-reach places, and under the bed is one of the most common areas where dust can accumulate. It is often neglected during regular cleaning routines, making it a prime spot for dust to accumulate. Cleaning under the bed can be a challenging task, especially if the bed is heavy or has limited clearance. Therefore, it is likely that cleaning under the bed would be the hardest area for John to clean."}}
{"Q": "Something had the nerve to break into the garbage last night, what did it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) eyes (B) animal (C) fingertips (D) brainstem (E) human body", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Animal.\nExplanation: It is more likely that an animal broke into the garbage than any of the other options given. Animals are known to scavenge for food in garbage cans and dumpsters, especially at night when they are less likely to be seen. Eyes, fingertips, brainstem, and human body are not plausible options as they are not capable of physically breaking into garbage."}}
{"Q": "Where would you go to get some pamphlets if you want to own them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bookstore (B) drawer (C) health department (D) mail box (E) library", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. library\nExplanation: Libraries are known for having a wide variety of pamphlets on different topics. They are often free to take and can be a great resource for information on health, education, and other topics. Bookstores may have pamphlets for sale, but they are not typically the primary source for them. Drawers and mailboxes are unlikely places to find pamphlets, and while the health department may have some, they are more likely to be focused on specific health issues rather than general information."}}
{"Q": "The audience cheered when a goal was scored, what were they spectating?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) school (B) sporting event (C) concert hall (D) show (E) television", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. sporting event.\nExplanation: The fact that the audience cheered when a goal was scored suggests that they were watching a live sports game, most likely soccer, hockey, or basketball. The other options, such as school, concert hall, show, or television, do not typically involve goals being scored and cheered for in the same way as a sporting event."}}
{"Q": "What western state has thousands of miles of shore?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) picture of sea side (B) seaside town (C) beach (D) california (E) see side picture", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: California.\nExplanation: California is a western state in the United States that has thousands of miles of shoreline along the Pacific Ocean. It is known for its beautiful beaches, coastal towns, and ocean views. Therefore, option (D) California is the correct answer. Options (A), (B), and (E) are not relevant to the question as they only depict images of the seaside or beach."}}
{"Q": "Everybody seemed to be crying at the holy site, the tour guide explained that this was what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) profane (B) halibut (C) damaged (D) common (E) halibut", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. common.\n\nExplanation: The word \"common\" means something that is widespread or happening frequently. In this context, the tour guide is explaining that it is common for people to cry at the holy site, possibly due to the emotional or spiritual significance of the location. The other answer choices, such as \"profane\" (meaning disrespectful or irreverent), \"halibut\" (a type of fish), and \"damaged\" (meaning harmed or broken), do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The smile gave away that the what was one of happiness?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) manual (B) rainbow (C) cry (D) frown (E) make others happy too", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. frown\nExplanation: The sentence states that the smile gave away something, which means that the smile was an indication of something else. The only option that makes sense in this context is (D) frown, as a smile and a frown are opposite expressions. Therefore, the smile gave away that the opposite expression, a frown, was not present and the person was happy."}}
{"Q": "Where is a public monument likely to be erected by a city?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) municipal park (B) office (C) state park (D) cemetary (E) public gardens", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Municipal park.\nExplanation: Municipal parks are often used as public spaces for community events and gatherings, making them a popular location for public monuments. They are accessible to the public and provide a central location for people to visit and appreciate the monument. Additionally, parks are often maintained by the city, making it easier for the city to oversee the upkeep of the monument. Office buildings, state parks, cemeteries, and public gardens may not be as suitable for public monuments due to their specific purposes and limitations."}}
{"Q": "Where would a person live if they wanted no neighbors?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) housing estate (B) neighborhood (C) mars (D) woods (E) suburbs", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. woods\nExplanation: If a person wants no neighbors, the best option would be to live in the woods. The woods provide a natural setting with plenty of space and privacy. While living in the suburbs or a housing estate may provide some level of privacy, there will still be neighbors nearby. Living on Mars is not currently feasible, and a neighborhood by definition implies the presence of neighbors. Therefore, living in the woods is the most plausible option for someone seeking complete solitude."}}
{"Q": "Where is the control room that controls a PWR located?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) building (B) factory (C) window (D) prison (E) nuclear power plant", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. nuclear power plant\nExplanation: The control room that controls a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) is located within the nuclear power plant itself. This is where trained operators monitor and control the reactor, as well as other important systems and processes within the plant. The control room is typically designed to be highly secure and protected from external threats, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks. Therefore, options such as building, factory, window, or prison are not plausible answers."}}
{"Q": "What happens to a dog before someone puts up posters of them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) get lost (B) require water (C) trained (D) bark (E) roll over", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. get lost\nExplanation: Dogs usually end up on missing posters because they have gotten lost or wandered away from their owners. It is important to put up posters in the area where the dog was last seen to increase the chances of someone finding and returning them to their owner."}}

Texas.\nExplanation: Texas is known for its BBQ culture and has some of the most famous BBQ steakhouses in America, such as Franklin Barbecue in Austin, Salt Lick BBQ in Driftwood, and Pecan Lodge in Dallas. These steakhouses are known for their delicious brisket, ribs, and other BBQ meats, and attract foodies from all over the world. Kansas City is also known for its BBQ, but Texas is often considered the BBQ capital of America. Building, Maine, and falling down are not relevant to the question."}}
{"Q": "He kept plugging away in his cubicle, it seemed he was the only person not called into the what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) building (B) conference (C) assessment (D) demonstration (E) garage", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) conference\nExplanation: The phrase \"called into\" suggests that the other employees were summoned or invited to something, and out of the given options, a conference is the most likely event that would require multiple employees to attend. A building, assessment, demonstration, or garage would not necessarily require the presence of all employees."}}
{"Q": "If you're attending school and are falling asleep you're likely experiencing what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) boredom (B) malaria (C) graduate (D) inspiration (E) detention", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. boredom\nExplanation: If someone is falling asleep in class, it is likely because they are bored or disengaged with the material being presented. Malaria, graduate, inspiration, and detention are not relevant to the situation and would not cause someone to feel sleepy in class."}}
{"Q": "I want to buy a gong, where should I look for one?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) orchestra (B) church (C) chinese temple (D) chinatown (E) music store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. music store\nExplanation: Music stores typically carry a variety of percussion instruments, including gongs. They may have different sizes and types of gongs to choose from, and the staff may be knowledgeable about the different options and can help you make a selection based on your needs and budget. While gongs may also be found in other locations such as orchestras, churches, Chinese temples, and Chinatown, a music store is likely the most convenient and reliable option for purchasing a gong."}}
{"Q": "What would friends do if they need each others' help?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) call each other (B) group together (C) understand each other (D) meet for lunch (E) part company", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Call each other.\nExplanation: When friends need each other's help, the most plausible action would be to call each other. This allows them to communicate their needs and discuss how they can help each other. It is a quick and efficient way to reach out and coordinate their efforts. Grouping together or meeting for lunch may also be helpful, but calling each other is the first step in the process. Understanding each other is important, but it is not an action that can be taken to provide immediate help. Parting company is not a helpful action when friends need each other's help."}}
{"Q": "When people are playing a game, what is their motivation to play?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) believe in god (B) dance (C) desire to win (D) destroy each other (E) run amok", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Desire to win.\nExplanation: The primary motivation for most people when playing a game is to win. Winning provides a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, and can also lead to rewards such as prizes or recognition. While some people may enjoy the social aspect of playing games or the challenge of competing against others, the desire to win is typically the driving force behind gameplay. Believing in god, dancing, destroying each other, or running amok are not typically motivations for playing games."}}
{"Q": "Where could there be a battle that involves words?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) court room (B) war (C) video game (D) iraq (E) church", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Court room.\nExplanation: A court room is a place where legal battles are fought using words as evidence and arguments. Lawyers present their cases and try to convince the judge or jury using their words and reasoning. It is a battle of words and persuasion, where the outcome can have significant consequences for the parties involved. While there may be battles involving words in other settings such as debates or political campaigns, a court room is a more plausible answer as it is a formal setting where legal disputes are resolved."}}
{"Q": "John didn't mind getting in line.  It was what game after that he hated.  The time, the sore feet. He did not like doing what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) have to wait for (B) standing in line (C) eat cake (D) less confusion (E) being ordered", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. standing in line.\nExplanation: The sentence states that John didn't mind getting in line, but he hated what came after that, which implies that he disliked standing in line for a long time. The other options, such as waiting for something, eating cake, less confusion, or being ordered, are not mentioned in the sentence and do not fit the context. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What is the process of going somewhere?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) fire (B) energy (C) car (D) transporting (E) staying in place", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Transporting.\nExplanation: Transporting refers to the act of moving from one place to another.

{"Q": "The old man needed to have rest multiple times a day, he would do what on the couch and catnap?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) lay in bed (B) lay in bed (C) go to bed (D) relax (E) lie down", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. lie down\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the old man needed to rest multiple times a day, which suggests that he may not need to go to bed every time he needs to rest. The word \"catnap\" also implies a short period of sleep or rest, which can be achieved by lying down on a couch. Therefore, option E, \"lie down,\" is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The end of the barrel of what primitive firearm is bell shaped?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) barbell (B) funnel (C) blunderbuss (D) wind instrument (E) kettlebell", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. blunderbuss.\n\nExplanation: The blunderbuss is a primitive firearm that was popular in the 17th and 18th centuries. It had a short, wide barrel that flared out at the end, creating a bell shape. This design allowed for a wider spread of shot, making it more effective at close range. The other choices, such as barbell, funnel, wind instrument, and kettlebell, do not have any connection to firearms or their design."}}

Drawer.\nExplanation: A drawer is a practical and convenient place to store pamphlets in your home or office.

A library, health department, mailbox, or bookstore may not be appropriate places to store your own pamphlets as they are public spaces or not designed for personal storage."}}
{"Q": "Many humans enjoy fishing and enjoy another relaxing activity at the same time, what activity is it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) getting tied up lure. (B) looking for information (C) get wet (D) drink beer (E) sit quietly", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. sit quietly\nExplanation: Fishing is often seen as a peaceful and relaxing activity, and many people enjoy the opportunity to sit quietly and enjoy the natural surroundings while waiting for a bite. While some people may choose to drink beer or get wet while fishing, these activities are not necessarily relaxing for everyone and may not be feasible or safe in all fishing environments. Looking for information or getting tied up in a lure are also not likely to be enjoyable or relaxing activities for most people while fishing. Therefore, sitting quietly is the most plausible answer as it aligns with the common perception of fishing as a calming and meditative activity."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get some maps that you own?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) bookstore (B) library (C) electrical circuit (D) cabinet (E) important when traveling", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. library\nExplanation: Libraries typically have a collection of maps that can be borrowed or checked out. This is a more plausible answer compared to the other options given, as bookstores may not always carry maps, electrical circuits have nothing to do with maps, and cabinets may not necessarily contain maps. Maps are important when traveling, but this is not a place to obtain them."}}
{"Q": "Where is a good place to put a hamburger?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) resturant (B) fast food restaurant (C) mouth (D) kitchen (E) pizza", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. kitchen\nExplanation: A hamburger is typically prepared and cooked in a kitchen, whether it's at home or in a restaurant. While it can certainly be enjoyed at a restaurant or fast food establishment, the most logical place to put a hamburger would be in a kitchen where it can be properly cooked and prepared to one's liking."}}

Desk drawer.\nExplanation: Storing a steel pen in a desk drawer is a practical and convenient option for an office setting. It keeps the pen easily accessible while also keeping it secure and out of the way when not in use.

Choosing option E, hand, is also not a practical solution as it may lead to misplacing or losing the pen."}}
{"Q": "A story about World War II would be set when?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) book or library (B) book or magazine (C) newspaper (D) past (E) future", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. past\nExplanation: World War II took place from 1939 to 1945, so it is a historical event that happened in the past. Therefore, it would be more plausible to find a story about World War II set in the past. Choices A, B, and E are not relevant to the time period of World War II, and a story about World War II would not be found in a newspaper unless it was a historical article or retrospective."}}
{"Q": "What type of geographic area will you find a marmot?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) mountainous area (B) wood pile (C) jungle (D) petting zoo (E) animals", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. mountainous area\nExplanation: Marmots are typically found in mountainous areas, such as the Rocky Mountains or the Alps. They prefer high-altitude habitats with rocky terrain and alpine meadows. Marmots are adapted to cold temperatures and hibernate during the winter months. Therefore, it is unlikely to find them in a wood pile, jungle, or petting zoo."}}

What might they do instead to achieve better outcomes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) set table (B) think (C) read books (D) play games (E) lie", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. think\nExplanation: Instead of making assumptions based on prejudices, people should take the time to think critically and objectively about a situation. This involves questioning their own biases and considering alternative perspectives. By doing so, they can achieve better outcomes and avoid making harmful assumptions. Setting the table, reading books, playing games, or lying are not relevant or effective solutions to this problem."}}
{"Q": "What is something children can do while traveling in a car?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) listen to music (B) watch television (C) play chess (D) walk (E) play basketball", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. listen to music.\nExplanation: Listening to music is a common and safe activity for children to do while traveling in a car.

Watching television or playing basketball are not feasible options while in a moving vehicle, playing chess requires a flat surface and pieces, and walking is not possible while seated in a car."}}
{"Q": "Where would you hear a trumpet along with other instruments made from the same material?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) music store (B) bass (C) brass band (D) orchestra (E) marching band", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. brass band\nExplanation: A brass band typically consists of instruments made from brass, including trumpets, trombones, and tubas.

{"Q": "The audience listened to the orchestra play, where were they watching the performance?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) concert hall (B) museum (C) school (D) hockey game (E) sporting event", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. concert hall.\nExplanation: The context of the sentence suggests that the orchestra is playing a musical performance, which is typically held in a concert hall. A museum, school, hockey game, or sporting event would not be appropriate venues for a musical performance by an orchestra. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Stabbing to death of a person is what sort of way to die?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) pool of blood (B) gruesome (C) charming (D) being arrested (E) killing", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. gruesome.\nExplanation: Stabbing to death is a violent and brutal way to die, resulting in a lot of blood loss and physical trauma. It is not a charming or pleasant way to go, and it often leaves a gruesome scene for those who discover the body. Being arrested is not a way to die, and killing is not a descriptive term for a method of death. Therefore, option B, gruesome, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What are you getting from you boss at the end of the week?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) asking for (B) money (C) food (D) work (E) energy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.

Market.\nExplanation: Markets are known for selling fresh produce, including fruits. They often source their products from local farmers, ensuring that the fruits are in season and freshly picked. Additionally, markets typically have a wider variety of fruits compared to big box retailers, which may only carry the most popular types. San Francisco and refrigerators are not viable options for buying fresh fruit, and while a tree may provide fresh fruit, it may not be accessible or practical for everyone."}}
{"Q": "The man took paperwork to other people to consult over it, where was he heading?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) desk (B) meeting (C) office (D) table (E) work", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. office\nExplanation: Taking paperwork to other people to consult over it suggests that the man was likely heading to an office where he could discuss the documents with colleagues or superiors. Desks, tables, and work areas are all possible locations within an office, but \"office\" is the most general and likely option. A meeting could also take place in an office, but the question specifically mentions the man consulting with others over paperwork, rather than attending a formal meeting."}}
{"Q": "Stark was just having fun, and he wasn't hurting anyone.  What might have he been doing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) painting his nails (B) playing marbles (C) constructing (D) need for rest (E) wild ride", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. painting his nails\nExplanation: Painting one's nails is a harmless and fun activity that does not cause harm to anyone else. It is a common activity for people of all genders and ages, and can be a way to express oneself creatively.

The other options, such as exhilaration, hardship, risk-taking, and happiness, do not make sense in the context of the church providing assistance."}}
{"Q": "I you believe in god, where will you go when you die?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) heaven (B) church (C) imagination (D) synagogue (E) monastery", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. heaven.\nExplanation: If one believes in God and follows the teachings of their religion, they would likely believe that they will go to heaven after they die. Heaven is often described as a place of eternal happiness and peace, where believers are reunited with loved ones and live in the presence of God.

{"Q": "What can eating hamburger cause immediately after eating it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) tasty (B) health problems (C) eat cake (D) indigestion (E) gain weight", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. indigestion\nExplanation: Eating a hamburger, especially if it is high in fat and grease, can cause indigestion or discomfort in the stomach and digestive system. This is because the body has to work harder to break down the heavy and fatty food, leading to bloating, gas, and other digestive issues. While hamburgers can be tasty, they can also cause immediate health problems such as indigestion. Eating cake or gaining weight may be possible consequences of eating hamburgers over time, but they are not immediate effects."}}
{"Q": "Where is a shelf likely to be hidden behind a door?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) refrigerator (B) bookstore (C) cupboard (D) school building (E) wardrobe", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. cupboard\n\nExplanation: A cupboard is a piece of furniture with doors that can be closed to hide the contents inside. It is common for shelves to be hidden behind the doors of a cupboard, making it a more plausible answer than the other options. A refrigerator typically does not have shelves hidden behind its door, and a bookstore, school building, and wardrobe are unlikely places to find a shelf hidden behind a door."}}
{"Q": "The man got a pail to catch the draining motor oil, where was he likely doing this at home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) garage (B) hardware store (C) utility room (D) wishing well (E) laundry", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. garage\nExplanation: It is common for people to change their car's motor oil in their garage. Therefore, it is likely that the man was catching the draining motor oil in a pail in his garage. The other options, such as hardware store, utility room, wishing well, and laundry, are less likely scenarios for catching motor oil."}}

Big city.\nExplanation: It is more likely to find a large number of restaurants in a big city compared to a town or small town. Cities have a higher population density and attract more tourists, which leads to a higher demand for restaurants. Additionally, big cities often have a diverse range of cuisines and dining options, making it easier to find a restaurant that suits your preferences. While the Yellow Pages may list many restaurants, it is not a location and does not guarantee a specific number of restaurants. Canada is a country and not a specific location to find restaurants."}}

Also, the option of meeting interesting people or entertaining seems unlikely as he is just lying in bed. Therefore, listening to music seems like the most plausible option as it is a passive activity that can be enjoyed while lying down."}}
{"Q": "At the picnic she was stuck eating hamburger, she was worried because she forgot her chewables to prevent what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) eat cake (B) have fun (C) food poisoning (D) heartburn (E) gain weight", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. food poisoning.\n\nExplanation: The fact that the person forgot their chewables suggests that they may have been relying on some sort of medication or supplement to prevent an issue related to food. Food poisoning is a common concern when eating at picnics or other outdoor events where food may not be stored or prepared properly. Chewables such as Pepto-Bismol or Tums can help alleviate symptoms of food poisoning, so forgetting them could be a cause for worry. The other answer choices (eating cake, having fun, heartburn, gaining weight) do not seem to be related to the context of the sentence."}}

Therefore, a student in engineering must have a strong foundation in mathematics and be able to apply mathematical concepts to real-world problems. While language skills and counting ability are important, they are not as essential to the field of engineering as a solid understanding of mathematics. Beginning to study is also important, but it is not specific to engineering and applies to any academic pursuit."}}
{"Q": "The teacher knew her students understood division, what was she hoping they would learn next?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) multiplication (B) multiply (C) putting together (D) unity (E) pay debts", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. multiplication\nExplanation: Since the teacher already knew that her students understood division, it would make sense for her to hope that they would learn multiplication next. Multiplication is the inverse operation of division, and understanding both operations is crucial for developing strong math skills. Additionally, multiplication is a fundamental concept that is used in many areas of math, including algebra and geometry. Therefore, it would be a logical next step for the teacher to focus on teaching her students multiplication after they have mastered division."}}

This can lead to decreased performance and even injury if the rider continues to push themselves beyond their limits. While enjoyment can also be a result of bike riding, falling down and getting lost are not necessarily common outcomes, and thirst can be mitigated by proper hydration."}}

Silence refers to the absence of sound or noise. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B, opera, is a type of music and would not be applicable in this scenario.

{"Q": "A potato is kept in the cellar, where is likely to be stored?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) farmer's market (B) grocery bag (C) pantry (D) bushel basket (E) fridge", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. pantry\n\nExplanation: A cellar is typically a cool, dark storage area in a house or building, often used for storing food items like potatoes, onions, and other root vegetables. A pantry is also a storage area for food, typically located in or near the kitchen, and is often used for storing non-perishable items like canned goods, dry goods, and snacks. Since a potato can be stored for a relatively long time in a cool, dark place, it is more likely to be stored in a pantry than in a farmer's market, grocery bag, bushel basket, or fridge."}}

Getting clothes dirty (option A) is the opposite of what one wants to do, and writing (option B) has nothing to do with cleaning clothes. While using water (option C) is necessary for cleaning clothes, it is not sufficient on its own. Therefore, option D, launder, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The person tried to reduce his weight with a shrink ray, but he got it backwards and only did what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) grow (B) gain weight (C) make larger (D) augment (E) get bigger", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If the person used a shrink ray backwards, it would have the opposite effect and make him grow instead of shrinking.

{"Q": "Christine couldn't be having a baby at her age, she thought to herself. What was Christine?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) old person (B) begin to talk (C) adult (D) old man (E) girl", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Adult.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that Christine is surprised or doubtful about the possibility of her having a baby at her age. This implies that she is not too young to have a baby, but rather too old. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (C) adult. The other options, such as old person, old man, girl, or begin to talk, do not fit the context of the statement."}}
{"Q": "Joe plays a percussion instrument in something.  What might be play in?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) own home (B) music store (C) marching band (D) orchestra (E) party", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Marching band.\nExplanation: Percussion instruments are commonly used in marching bands, as they provide a strong beat and rhythm to accompany the movement of the band. Joe may play a snare drum, bass drum, or other percussion instrument while marching in parades or performing at sporting events. While he could also play in an orchestra or at a party, the use of percussion instruments is more common in marching bands. Playing in his own home or a music store would not provide the same performance opportunities as playing in a group setting."}}
{"Q": "If I'm playing ball, I'm mostly trying to do what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) losing (B) competition (C) having fun (D) win (E) injury", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) win.\nExplanation: When playing ball, most people are trying to win. Winning is often the ultimate goal of competition, and it can be a source of satisfaction and pride. While having fun is also important, winning is often the primary objective for many players."}}
{"Q": "What do the terms need to be in order to compete against someone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) cheat (B) fair (C) in competition (D) practice (E) sabotage", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. fair\nExplanation: In order to compete against someone, the terms must be fair. Cheating and sabotage are unethical and can result in disqualification or penalties. Practicing is important to improve skills, but it does not necessarily determine the fairness of the competition. Being in competition is a given if one is competing against someone, but it does not address the fairness of the terms. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B. fair."}}
{"Q": "If you wanted to show off silk, what item could it be on?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) jean (B) mulberry tree (C) garments (D) expensive clothing (E) parachutes", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) garments\nExplanation: Silk is a luxurious and delicate fabric that is often used in high-end clothing such as dresses, blouses, and suits. Garments made of silk can showcase the fabric's softness, sheen, and drape, making it an ideal choice for showing off the material. Jeans and parachutes are not typically made of silk, and while mulberry trees are used to produce silk, they do not showcase the fabric itself. Expensive clothing could be made of silk, but it is too broad of a category to be a specific item to showcase silk."}}
{"Q": "Where is known to be a wealth of information?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) park (B) internet (C) meeting (D) library (E) book", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. library\nExplanation: Libraries are known to be a wealth of information as they contain a vast collection of books, journals, newspapers, and other resources on various subjects. They also provide access to online databases and other electronic resources, making them an excellent source of information for research and learning. Unlike the internet, which can be unreliable and overwhelming, libraries offer curated and verified information that can be trusted. Additionally, libraries often have knowledgeable staff who can assist with research and provide guidance on finding relevant resources."}}
{"Q": "I saw the receptionist carelessly toss my resume into the drawer, where did I want it to end up?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) file cabinet (B) nightstand (C) kitchen cabinet (D) office desk (E) the floor", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. file cabinet\nExplanation: When submitting a resume, it is expected that the receptionist or hiring manager will keep it in a safe and organized place for future reference. The most plausible option for this would be a file cabinet, where it can be easily accessed and kept in good condition. Tossing it into a nightstand, kitchen cabinet, or on the floor would not only be unprofessional but also increase the risk of damage or loss. An office desk could be a possibility, but it may not be the most secure or organized option."}}
{"Q": "What will happen if you inject water into yourself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) dilute (B) thin blood (C) take several forms (D) wet clothes (E) move mountains", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Dilute\nExplanation: Injecting water into oneself can lead to dilution of the body's fluids, which can disrupt the balance of electrolytes and cause a condition called hyponatremia. This can lead to symptoms such as nausea, headache, confusion, seizures, and even coma in severe cases. Injecting water can also lead to swelling and inflammation at the injection site. Therefore, injecting water into oneself is not recommended and can be dangerous."}}
{"Q": "Athletes soak in hot tubs to relieve what after playing baseball?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) fame (B) errors (C) pain (D) strikes (E) sore muscles", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: Athletes often soak in hot tubs to relieve sore muscles after playing baseball. The warm water helps to increase blood flow and relax the muscles, reducing soreness and stiffness. Fame, errors, strikes, and pain are not typically relieved by soaking in a hot tub."}}
{"Q": "What does a gambler do that causes him or her to be unhappy?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) play cards (B) double winnings (C) lose money (D) play poker (E) to win the prize", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. lose money.\nExplanation: Gambling involves taking risks and there is always a chance of losing money.

While winning can bring temporary happiness, the potential for losing money is always present and can ultimately lead to unhappiness."}}
{"Q": "There's one obvious reason to eat vegetables, they're plain what you?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) lose weight (B) good for (C) bland (D) chewing (E) fibre", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Good for you.\nExplanation: Vegetables are packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that are important for maintaining good health. They are also low in calories and high in fiber, which can help with weight management and digestive health. While some vegetables may be considered bland in taste, their nutritional benefits far outweigh any lack of flavor."}}

They were what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pay debts (B) slender (C) unacquainted (D) free flowing (E) sparse", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. unacquainted.\nExplanation: The sentence states that John never saw the lady before, indicating that they were not familiar with each other. Therefore, the most plausible answer is unacquainted. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Where would you hear a violin along side many string and wind instruments?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) school (B) string quartet (C) orchestra (D) kitchen (E) music room", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. orchestra\nExplanation: An orchestra typically consists of many string and wind instruments, including violins. It is a large ensemble that performs classical music and can be heard in concert halls, theaters, and other performance venues. A school or music room may have a smaller ensemble, such as a string quartet, but an orchestra is the most likely place to hear a violin alongside many other instruments. The kitchen is not a plausible answer as it is not a typical location for musical performances."}}
{"Q": "What is the sun ultimately responsible for?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) earth warming (B) sun tan (C) light (D) life on earth (E) heat", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. life on earth\nExplanation: The sun is ultimately responsible for providing the energy that sustains life on earth. Through photosynthesis, plants convert the sun's energy into food, which is then consumed by animals and humans. Without the sun, life on earth would not be possible. While the sun also provides light and heat, these are secondary to its role in sustaining life."}}
{"Q": "Mandy lived in a train station.  She longed to see distant places. Where might she imagine going?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) downtown area (B) centre of town (C) bedroom (D) europe (E) big city", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Europe.\nExplanation: Since Mandy lived in a train station, it is likely that she has a fascination with trains and travel. Europe is a popular destination for travelers and would be a logical place for Mandy to imagine going to satisfy her desire to see distant places. The other options, such as the downtown area, center of town, bedroom, and big city, are not as specific or exciting as a trip to Europe."}}
{"Q": "Joe is a  squirrel, which is an animal. He probably lives in what sort of place.", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pet store (B) outside (C) woodland (D) ocean (E) cafe", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. woodland\nExplanation: Squirrels are typically found in wooded areas where they can climb trees and gather nuts and other food sources. They are not typically found in pet stores, oceans, or cafes, and while they may venture outside, their natural habitat is in woodland areas."}}
{"Q": "Where could a personal ficus live?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cabin in the woods (B) california (C) front yard (D) conservatory (E) tropical forest", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Conservatory.\nExplanation: A personal ficus is a type of indoor plant that requires a warm and humid environment to thrive. While it is possible to keep a ficus in a front yard or even in a cabin in the woods, it would not be an ideal environment for the plant. California may have a suitable climate for a ficus, but it would still need to be kept indoors during the cooler months. A tropical forest would be the most ideal environment for a ficus, but it is not a practical location for most people. Therefore, a conservatory, which is a greenhouse-like structure designed to provide a controlled environment for plants, would be the most plausible location for a personal ficus."}}
{"Q": "The shark actually counted as evidence, so where did the legal team bring it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) court room (B) shallow waters (C) poker game (D) sea world (E) pond arena", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. court room\nExplanation: The legal team would bring the shark as evidence to the court room, where it would be presented to the judge and jury as part of the case. The shark would be used to support the argument or prove a point in the case, and would be carefully handled and preserved as evidence. Bringing the shark to shallow waters, a poker game, a sea world, or a pond arena would not be relevant or appropriate in a legal context."}}
{"Q": "If the president wanted to ban snakes, where would he issue such a decree?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) street (B) tropical forest (C) garden of eden (D) new mexico (E) white house", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. White House.\nExplanation: The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States. If the President wanted to issue a decree banning snakes, he would do so from the White House, as it is the center of executive power in the United States. The other options, such as a street, tropical forest, garden of eden, or New Mexico, are not appropriate locations for issuing official decrees."}}
{"Q": "They were searching for rocks, so they missed the birds overhead as they stared at the what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) ground (B) drawer (C) surface of earth (D) pizza (E) waterfall", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (A) ground, as the sentence suggests that the people were searching for rocks, which are typically found on the ground. Therefore, it is likely that they were staring at the ground and missed the birds flying overhead. The other options, such as (B) drawer, (C) surface of earth, (D) pizza, and (E) waterfall, do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Her son scraped his knee, she fetched a bottle of peroxide from the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) supermarket (B) diaper bag (C) liquor store (D) hollow log (E) medicine cabinet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. medicine cabinet\nExplanation: It is common for households to keep first aid supplies, such as peroxide, in their medicine cabinets for emergencies. The other options, such as a supermarket or liquor store, would not typically carry peroxide, and a hollow log or diaper bag would not be a practical or sanitary place to store it."}}
{"Q": "Where would you expect to find a dictionary along side other writings you can borrow?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) classroom (B) shelf (C) explain meaning of words (D) table (E) library", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. library\n\nExplanation: A library is a place where you can borrow books and other materials, including dictionaries. It is common to find dictionaries alongside other writings in a library, as they are a useful resource for readers and researchers. Classrooms may have dictionaries, but they are typically owned by the teacher and not available for borrowing. Shelves and tables may also hold books, but they are not specific to lending materials. \"Explain meaning of words\" is not a location, but rather a function of a dictionary."}}
{"Q": "What would be necessary for getting in shape?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) good health (B) exercise (C) muscle tone (D) sweat (E) feel better", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Exercise.\nExplanation: Getting in shape requires physical activity, which is achieved through exercise. While good health and muscle tone are important factors in overall fitness, they are not necessarily prerequisites for getting in shape. Sweating is a natural response to physical activity, but it alone does not guarantee fitness. Feeling better may be a result of exercise, but it is not a necessary component for getting in shape."}}
{"Q": "A statue that shoots liquid is called a what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) water fountain (B) large city (C) museum (D) pool (E) central park", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Water fountain.\nExplanation: A water fountain is a decorative structure that shoots water or liquid into the air. It is often found in public places such as parks, plazas, and gardens. While some fountains may have intricate designs and sculptures, they all serve the purpose of providing a visually appealing display of water. Therefore, a statue that shoots liquid is most likely a water fountain."}}

This can involve techniques such as deep breathing, mindfulness, or physical activities like yoga or stretching. By learning how to calm themselves down, the child may be better able to control their impulses and avoid getting into trouble."}}
{"Q": "John loved to paint houses.  How did he usually do it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) clothes get stained (B) with brush (C) wallpaper (D) electrical circuit (E) draw", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that John painted houses with a brush. The other options (clothes get stained, wallpaper, electrical circuit, draw) do not make sense in the context of painting houses. Clothes may get stained while painting, but it is not a method of painting. Wallpaper is a type of wall covering, not a painting technique. Electrical circuit is not related to painting at all. Drawing is a different art form that does not involve painting houses. Therefore, option B is the most logical choice."}}
{"Q": "When you wipe you feet on the door mat and walk through the door where do you enter?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) a chair (B) school (C) living room (D) doorway (E) bathroom", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) living room\nExplanation: Typically, a doormat is placed outside the entrance of a house or apartment to help remove dirt and debris from shoes before entering. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that wiping your feet on the doormat and walking through the door would lead you into the living room, which is often the first room you enter upon entering a home."}}
{"Q": "What can you use to store a book while traveling?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) library of congress (B) pocket (C) backpack (D) suitcase (E) synagogue", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. backpack\nExplanation: A backpack is a common and practical item to use for storing a book while traveling. It is designed to carry items and is easy to transport. The Library of Congress is a national library and not a storage option for personal travel. A pocket may be too small for a book, and a suitcase may be too bulky for a single book. A synagogue is a place of worship and not a storage option for personal travel."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find gazelle under a G?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) open field (B) ivory coast (C) dictionary (D) steppe (E) encyclopedia", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. dictionary.\n\nExplanation: The question is asking where you would find the word \"gazelle\" under the letter G. The most plausible answer is a dictionary, as it is a reference book that lists words in alphabetical order. The other options, such as an open field or the Ivory Coast, are locations where gazelles may be found in real life, but they do not relate to the question of where to find the word in a reference book. The steppe and encyclopedia options are also less likely, as they do not specifically relate to the letter G or alphabetical order."}}
{"Q": "Competing can lead to great highs, and also great lows when suffering what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) winning or losing (B) aggression (C) gain (D) defeat (E) sweat", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. winning or losing\nExplanation: Competing involves striving to win, but there is always the possibility of losing. Winning can lead to great highs, while losing can result in great lows. This is because people often invest a lot of time, effort, and emotion into competing, and the outcome can have a significant impact on their self-esteem and sense of accomplishment. Therefore, winning or losing is a more plausible answer than aggression, gain, defeat, or sweat."}}
{"Q": "What blocks sunshine?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) summer (B) park (C) desktop (D) sea (E) moon", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. moon\nExplanation: The moon can block sunshine during a solar eclipse when it passes between the sun and the earth, casting a shadow on the earth's surface. This is a natural phenomenon that occurs periodically and can be observed with proper eye protection. The other choices, such as summer, park, desktop, and sea, do not block sunshine."}}
{"Q": "When you feel too much heat in your home you can turn on what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) coolness (B) fan (C) get wet (D) coldness (E) air conditioning", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: When feeling too much heat in your home, the most plausible option to turn on would be air conditioning. This is because air conditioning systems are designed to cool down the temperature of a room or space by removing heat and moisture from the air. Turning on a fan or getting wet may provide temporary relief, but they do not actually lower the temperature of the room. Coldness is not an option that can be turned on, as it is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the temperature drops."}}
{"Q": "Where would you store a pillow case that is not in use?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) kitchen cupboard (B) bedding store (C) england (D) drawer (E) bedroom", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Drawer.\nExplanation: A pillow case is a bedding item and is typically stored in a bedroom. The most common place to store a pillow case when not in use would be in a drawer, such as a dresser drawer or a linen closet. Storing it in a kitchen cupboard or a bedding store would not make sense, and England is not a relevant option for this question."}}
{"Q": "If the kitten was going to grow up to be a mouser like it's mother, where should it spend most of it's time?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) shelter (B) floor (C) warm place (D) farmhouse (E) living room", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Farmhouse.\n\nExplanation: Since the kitten is going to grow up to be a mouser like its mother, it should spend most of its time in a place where there are mice to catch. A farmhouse is more likely to have mice than a shelter, living room, or warm place. The floor is also a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee the presence of mice. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D. Farmhouse."}}
{"Q": "Where is that man buying silk from?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) space shuttle (B) theater (C) china (D) indian resteraunt (E) bar", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. China.\nExplanation: It is plausible that the man is buying silk from China as it is known for its production of high-quality silk. China has a long history of silk production and is still one of the largest producers of silk in the world. Additionally, silk is often associated with Chinese culture and is a popular souvenir for tourists visiting China."}}
{"Q": "Where is a teacher likely to keep her clavichord?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) living room (B) parlor (C) music hall (D) music room (E) museum", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. music room.\n\nExplanation: A clavichord is a musical instrument that is typically used for practice and small performances. Therefore, it is more likely that a teacher would keep her clavichord in a dedicated music room where she can practice and teach her students. A living room or parlor may not be suitable for this purpose, and a music hall or museum would be too large and public for personal use."}}
{"Q": "Where are you if your bieifcase is going through an x-ray machine?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) luggage store (B) courtroom (C) airport (D) office building (E) hand", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. airport\nExplanation: When your briefcase is going through an x-ray machine, it is most likely that you are at an airport, either checking in for a flight or going through security before boarding a plane.

{"Q": "They were kissing each other good bye, they had no worries because their relationship had a strong foundation of what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) partner (B) trust (C) cooperation (D) bricks (E) herpes", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. trust\nExplanation: Trust is a crucial element in any strong relationship. It allows partners to rely on each other, communicate openly, and feel secure in their commitment to one another. Without trust, a relationship can quickly deteriorate, leading to doubts, insecurities, and ultimately, a breakdown in communication and intimacy. Therefore, it is more plausible that their strong foundation is built on trust rather than any of the other options provided."}}
{"Q": "Why would you take a bus to work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) commute (B) flying (C) get somewhere (D) travel (E) go home", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Commute.\nExplanation: Taking a bus to work is a common way to commute for many people, especially those who live in urban areas where public transportation is readily available.

Fishing is a common way to obtain food, especially in areas where fishing is a common practice or where there are bodies of water with fish. While fishing can also be a recreational activity, the fact that the person is hungry suggests that they have a more practical reason for going fishing."}}
{"Q": "Dogs are very loyal if they have a good owner, they will always what them?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) fleas (B) eat cake (C) attack (D) defend (E) run fast", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Dogs are known for their protective nature and will defend their owners if they feel they are in danger. This loyalty and protective instinct is one of the reasons why dogs are often used as guard dogs or for search and rescue missions. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (D) defend."}}
{"Q": "What does a farmer need to do to make  a maze on his farm in the fall?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) seed plants (B) plant seeds (C) garden (D) grow corn (E) produce food", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. grow corn.\nExplanation: To make a maze on a farm in the fall, a farmer typically grows corn. The corn is planted in a specific pattern to create a maze-like structure. As the corn grows, it creates walls that people can walk through, creating a fun and challenging activity for visitors. Other crops could potentially be used to create a maze, but corn is the most common choice due to its height and density."}}
{"Q": "For many males hair is a concern as they get older, it begins to what, causing a receding hairline?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) thin out (B) grow in ear (C) fall out (D) bulge (E) composted", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. fall out.\n\nExplanation: As males age, their hair follicles may become more sensitive to hormones, particularly dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which can cause the hair to gradually fall out. This often starts with a receding hairline at the temples and/or a thinning crown. While hair thinning (A) is also a concern for some men, it is not typically associated with a receding hairline. Growing hair in the ear (B) or bulging (D) are not related to hair loss. Composting (E) is not a relevant option."}}
{"Q": "What happens someone who is bad play poker?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) think (B) ante up (C) drink (D) win money (E) losing money", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Losing money.\nExplanation: When someone who is bad plays poker, they are more likely to make mistakes and poor decisions, which can lead to losing money. Poker is a game of skill and strategy, and those who are not proficient in these areas are at a disadvantage. Additionally, if someone is not familiar with the rules and strategies of poker, they may not understand the importance of managing their bankroll and may end up losing more money than they can afford."}}
{"Q": "John loved his snake.  It was the only ting he loved. He hated everyone else and was abrasive to most people, but he loved his snake.   How might you describe the snake?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sun itself (B) tropical forest (C) pet (D) rude (E) sharp", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. pet\nExplanation: The fact that John loved his snake suggests that it was a pet to him. Additionally, the sentence structure implies that the snake was a separate entity from John's feelings towards other people, indicating that it was not just a random snake in the wild. Therefore, \"pet\" is the most plausible description of the snake."}}
{"Q": "The fresh herbs, flowers, and vegetables will shrivel up if people don't do this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) water plants (B) believe in god (C) drive to the nearest pool (D) speaking english (E) raise children", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is A, which is to water the plants. Fresh herbs, flowers, and vegetables require water to survive and thrive. Without regular watering, they will eventually shrivel up and die. Therefore, it is important to water plants regularly to keep them healthy and vibrant. The other options, such as believing in god, driving to the nearest pool, speaking English, or raising children, have no direct correlation to the health and well-being of plants."}}
{"Q": "I picked from an apple tree outside of Fort Wayne, where am I?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) woods (B) illinois (C) indiana (D) washington state (E) tampa", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Indiana\nExplanation: Fort Wayne is a city located in the state of Indiana, so it is most likely that the apple tree is also located in Indiana. The other options, such as woods, Illinois, Washington state, and Tampa, do not have any direct connection to Fort Wayne or the state of Indiana."}}
{"Q": "The janitor never had much to clean after services, but there was still always a paper or two to pick up where?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) synagogue (B) front porch (C) classroom (D) obesity (E) grocery store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. synagogue\nExplanation: The context of the sentence suggests that the janitor is cleaning up after some kind of religious service, which is most likely to take place in a synagogue. The other options, such as front porch, classroom, obesity, and grocery store, do not fit the context and are unlikely to be places where a janitor would be cleaning up after a religious service."}}
{"Q": "If you're celebrating with too many cocktails what may you have in the morning?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) drunkenness (B) have fun (C) headache (D) hang over (E) intimacy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) hangover\nExplanation: Consuming too many cocktails can lead to a hangover the next morning, which is characterized by symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, and dehydration.

{"Q": "Where are you likely to find much more than a drop of blood on the floor?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) crime scene (B) vein (C) blood bank (D) slaughter house (E) needle", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. slaughter house\nExplanation: A slaughter house is a place where animals are killed for meat production. Therefore, it is likely to find much more than a drop of blood on the floor due to the slaughtering process. Crime scenes may also have a significant amount of blood, but it is not a guaranteed occurrence.

{"Q": "Where is the first place someone leaving the planet ends up?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pay debts (B) galaxy (C) outer space (D) orbit (E) universe", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) outer space\nExplanation: When someone leaves the planet, they enter outer space, which is the area beyond the Earth's atmosphere. This is the first place they would end up before traveling further into the galaxy or universe. Paying debts or entering the universe are not relevant to leaving the planet, and orbit is a specific path around a celestial body, not a destination for someone leaving the planet."}}
{"Q": "The town house went right to the curb, a slot effectively made a mailbox of the what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) apartment building (B) front door (C) back door (D) street corner (E) porch", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. front door\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the town house is located right next to the curb, and a slot has been made to serve as a mailbox. Since the mailbox is located right at the curb, it is unlikely that it would be attached to an apartment building or a street corner. Similarly, it is unlikely that the mailbox would be attached to the back door or porch of the town house. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the slot has been made in the front door of the town house to serve as a mailbox."}}
{"Q": "The architect thought that a mezzanine would look good, but the planning committee rejected it.  They told the architect that they felt it was a potential hazard given the ages of the people who would be using it.  What might they be designing?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) actors (B) theater (C) concert hall (D) floors (E) school", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. school\nExplanation: A mezzanine is a partial floor that is typically located between the main floor and the next higher floor in a building. Given the concern about the potential hazard for people of certain ages, it is likely that the architect was designing a school with a mezzanine level. Schools often have mezzanine levels for various purposes, such as additional classrooms or administrative offices. The planning committee's rejection of the mezzanine suggests that they were prioritizing safety concerns for the students and staff who would be using the space."}}
{"Q": "The person wasn't bothered by the weather, she had remembered to bring her what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) read book (B) own house (C) apartment (D) more rice (E) warm coat", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. warm coat\nExplanation: The fact that the person wasn't bothered by the weather suggests that it was cold or inclement outside. Bringing a warm coat would be a practical solution to staying comfortable in such conditions. The other options, such as a read book, own house, apartment, or more rice, are not relevant to the situation and would not have any impact on the person's comfort in the weather."}}
{"Q": "If you want to learn about the world and understand the real reasons behind cultural norms and mores, you have achieved a sense of what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) enlightenment (B) open mind (C) confusion (D) smartness (E) anger", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. open mind.\nExplanation: To truly learn about the world and understand cultural norms and mores, one must approach the subject matter with an open mind. This means being willing to consider different perspectives and ideas, and being receptive to new information and experiences. Having an open mind allows for personal growth and a deeper understanding of the world around us. Enlightenment, while related, is a more spiritual or philosophical concept and may not necessarily be required for understanding cultural norms and mores. Confusion, anger, and smartness are not necessarily indicative of a willingness to learn and understand, and may even hinder the process."}}
{"Q": "What is the hopeful result of going to see a play?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) sit (B) being entertained (C) jobless (D) meet (E) laugh", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Being entertained.\nExplanation: The most common reason for going to see a play is to be entertained. People go to the theater to enjoy a performance, to be moved by the story, to experience the emotions of the characters, and to appreciate the artistry of the actors, directors, and designers. While sitting, meeting people, and laughing may also be part of the experience, the primary goal is to be entertained. Going to see a play can be a fun and enriching activity that allows people to escape from their daily routine and immerse themselves in a different world for a few hours."}}
{"Q": "A person would join a trade school for finding information related to what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) ulcers (B) degree (C) understanding of (D) gaining knowledge (E) happiness", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. degree\nExplanation: Trade schools typically offer vocational or technical training programs that lead to a specific degree or certification in a particular trade or skill. These programs are designed to provide students with practical, hands-on training and knowledge that can be applied directly to a specific career or industry. Therefore, a person would join a trade school to gain the necessary skills and credentials to pursue a career in a specific field, such as welding, plumbing, or automotive repair. Ulcers, understanding, gaining knowledge, and happiness are not typically the primary reasons for joining a trade school."}}
{"Q": "Joan was a baby, so there were many things she couldn't do, which caused problems for her parents.  Name one thing that makes raising a baby difficult.", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) arrive early (B) learn to walk (C) boy or girl (D) bring joy (E) talk nonsense", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Learning to walk is a major milestone for babies, but it also poses a challenge for parents. Babies are unsteady on their feet and can easily fall or hurt themselves. This requires constant supervision and attention from parents, which can be exhausting and stressful. Additionally, babies who are learning to walk may become frustrated and irritable, which can make it difficult for parents to soothe them. Overall, learning to walk is just one of many challenges that make raising a baby difficult."}}

The best place to store ham before cooking is in the refrigerator, which will keep it fresh and safe to eat. Option (A) hamshackle is not a valid term, (B) pizza is not a suitable place to cook ham, and (E) part of meal is too vague to be a specific answer. Option (C) fridge is similar to (D) refrigerator, but the latter is a more commonly used term."}}
{"Q": "Running errands with screaming kids will likely cause what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) efficiency (B) insanity (C) aggravation (D) tiredness (E) stress", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Running errands with screaming kids is likely to cause aggravation, as the noise and chaos can be frustrating and overwhelming. It may also make it difficult to focus on completing tasks efficiently, leading to additional stress and exhaustion. While tiredness and stress may also be outcomes of this situation, insanity seems like an extreme and unlikely result."}}
{"Q": "Sam wasn't lying, but he left out important details. He was being what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) dishonesty (B) deceitful (C) imagination (D) deceptive (E) poker face", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) deceptive\nExplanation: Sam's behavior can be described as deceptive because he intentionally left out important details, which can mislead others into forming an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of the situation.

{"Q": "what does someone have that causes them committing murder?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) problems (B) distress (C) fear (D) go to jail (E) killer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. problems\nExplanation: People who commit murder often have underlying problems such as mental illness, substance abuse, or a history of trauma. These problems can lead to a lack of impulse control, violent behavior, and a disregard for the value of human life. While distress and fear may contribute to someone's decision to commit murder, it is often the presence of underlying problems that are the root cause. Going to jail is a consequence of committing murder, not a cause. The term \"killer\" is too broad and does not provide a specific explanation for why someone would commit murder."}}
{"Q": "What kind of place has a leader?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) army (B) battle (C) wildlife (D) country (E) organization", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: A country typically has a leader, such as a president or prime minister, who is responsible for governing and making decisions on behalf of the nation.

{"Q": "How is a person likely to communicatewith others?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) say words (B) meet friends (C) open mouth (D) thank god (E) die of cancer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Say words.\nExplanation: Communication typically involves the use of language, which is expressed through spoken or written words. While meeting friends and opening one's mouth may be part of the process of communication, they are not sufficient on their own. Thanking God and dying of cancer are not relevant to the question of how a person communicates with others. Therefore, saying words is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where may you be if you're buying pork chops at a corner shop?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) england (B) town (C) desert (D) kentucky (E) iowa", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) town\nExplanation: It is more likely that you would be in a town or city if you are buying pork chops at a corner shop. Corner shops are typically small convenience stores located in urban areas, where people can quickly purchase groceries and other household items. While it is possible to find corner shops in rural areas, it is less common to find them selling fresh meat like pork chops. Therefore, option (B) town is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where is a well used toy car likely to be found?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) child's room (B) boy's bedroom (C) own home (D) toy store (E) house", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. child's room.\n\nExplanation: A well-used toy car is most likely to be found in a child's room as it is a common toy for children to play with. It is less likely to be found in a boy's bedroom specifically as girls also play with toy cars, and it is also less likely to be found in a toy store or someone else's house. The most plausible answer is the child's room as it is the most common location for a child's toys."}}
{"Q": "Where can fisherman store their rods when on a fishing trip?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) hardware store (B) engine (C) fishing camp (D) lake (E) sporting goods store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. fishing camp\nExplanation: Fishing camps often provide storage options for fishermen to store their rods when not in use. This allows fishermen to easily access their equipment and ensures that their rods are kept safe and secure while they are not being used. Hardware stores and sporting goods stores may sell fishing equipment, but they typically do not offer storage options for fishermen. Storing rods in an engine or at a lake would not be practical or safe."}}
{"Q": "Danny is having fun just dancing and singing with his friends. He wasn't concerned with things that weren't fun. For him having fun is the same as what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) injuries (B) smiling (C) being happy (D) glee (E) jump", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Danny's focus on having fun suggests that he values happiness and enjoyment. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (C) being happy. The other options, such as injuries, glee, and jumping, do not necessarily align with the idea of having fun and enjoying oneself. Smiling could be a possible answer, but it is not as comprehensive as being happy, which encompasses a wider range of positive emotions."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find an office worker gossiping with their colleagues?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) water cooler (B) space shuttle (C) baby shower (D) bus stop (E) family", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. water cooler\nExplanation: The water cooler is a common gathering spot in offices where employees take breaks and chat with their colleagues.

Container.\n\nExplanation: If the nails are already packaged, it would be best to put them in a container to keep them organized and prevent them from spilling or getting lost. A container can also protect the nails from moisture and other environmental factors that could cause them to rust or deteriorate. Additionally, a container can be easily labeled and stored in a designated area for easy access when needed."}}
{"Q": "What is a person who is good at sports considered?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) lazy (B) own house (C) talented (D) affluent (E) reproduce", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. talented\nExplanation: A person who is good at sports is typically considered talented, as they have developed a skill and ability in a particular physical activity.

{"Q": "The pencil sharpener was broken in the classroom, where did the teacher recommend the student go?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) home (B) library (C) stationery store (D) cabinet (E) desk drawer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. stationery store.\nExplanation: Since the pencil sharpener in the classroom is broken, the teacher would likely recommend the student to go to a place where they can buy a new one. The most plausible option from the given choices is a stationery store, where they can find a variety of school supplies including pencil sharpeners. Going home or searching for a sharpener in a desk drawer or cabinet would not be practical solutions, and the library is not likely to have a pencil sharpener available for purchase."}}
{"Q": "Where does a child likely sit at a desk?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) furniture store (B) schoolroom (C) patio (D) office building (E) library", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. schoolroom\nExplanation: A child is most likely to sit at a desk in a schoolroom, where they attend classes and complete schoolwork.

Winning can bring a rush of adrenaline and a feeling of satisfaction, especially if the game was challenging. It can also lead to positive emotions such as happiness and pride. While soccer games can sometimes lead to conflicts and fights, these outcomes are not necessarily a direct result of winning."}}
{"Q": "What attraction is sometimes so large that you need a map to find your way around?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) amusement park (B) truck stop (C) mcdonalds (D) backpack (E) classroom", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Amusement park.\nExplanation: Amusement parks are often very large and have many different attractions, rides, and areas to explore.

They are often used by advertisers to grab the attention of website visitors and promote their products or services. While advertisements can also appear in other forms such as emails or on buses, the use of the term \"pop-up\" suggests that the advertisement in this question appeared on a web page."}}
{"Q": "WHere do people live?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) apartment (B) eat cake (C) bus depot (D) football stadium (E) surface of earth", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) apartment\nExplanation: The most common and plausible answer is (A) apartment. People live in apartments as it provides them with a safe and comfortable living space. Apartments are designed to accommodate families or individuals and offer various amenities such as security, maintenance, and community facilities. It is a practical and affordable option for people who cannot afford to buy a house or prefer to live in urban areas. The other options, such as (B) eat cake, (C) bus depot, and (D) football stadium, are not suitable for living as they are not designed for residential purposes. (E) surface of earth is a broad option and does not provide a specific living space."}}

{"Q": "The juror was quite bored and zoning out but wanted to convey he was hearing testimony, so he just sat there doing what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) take notes (B) nodding (C) change of heart (D) writing down (E) listening", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Nodding.\nExplanation: Nodding is a plausible answer as it can convey that the juror is paying attention and acknowledging the testimony being given, without requiring much effort or engagement. Taking notes or writing down may require more active participation and focus, while a change of heart would be unrelated to the juror's level of engagement with the testimony. Simply listening without any visible indication of attention may not be enough to convince others that the juror is actively participating in the trial."}}
{"Q": "They wanted to try blowfish, so they went to get some where?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) atlantic ocean (B) books (C) france (D) aquarium (E) fish market", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. fish market\nExplanation: Blowfish is a type of fish that is commonly consumed in Japan and other parts of Asia. It is unlikely that one would find blowfish in the Atlantic Ocean or in France, and books or an aquarium would not be places to obtain the fish for consumption.

{"Q": "When a main artery is used to expedite travel what would it be referred to as?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) neck (B) busy city (C) own brain (D) thruway (E) food", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Thruway.\nExplanation: A thruway is a main artery or highway that is designed to expedite travel by providing a direct route with limited access points. It is often used for long-distance travel and can connect major cities or regions. The other choices, such as neck, busy city, own brain, and food, do not relate to the concept of a main artery used for travel."}}

The universe encompasses all matter, energy, space, and time, so whoever rules it would have ultimate authority over everything that exists. Choices A, B, D, and E are all much more limited in scope and would not be applicable to someone who rules the universe."}}
{"Q": "The butt was bare, and Sam couldn't stop staring at it.  It was very what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) full (B) ample (C) covered (D) bareword (E) ample", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the butt was bare, meaning it was not covered by any clothing. Therefore, options A and E, which suggest that the butt was full or ample, do not make sense in this context. Option C, which suggests that the butt was covered, is the opposite of what the sentence says. Option B, which suggests that the butt was ample, could be a possibility, but it is not the most plausible answer given the context of the sentence. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D, which simply restates what the sentence already says."}}
{"Q": "Where can many stores with clothing be found?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) shop (B) mall (C) department store (D) drawer (E) library", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. mall\nExplanation: A mall is a large shopping center that typically has many stores selling clothing and other items.

Therefore, the most plausible outcome would be that the car started running after the repairs were made. The other options, such as going too fast or honking the horn, do not necessarily indicate that the car was fixed or improved in any way."}}
{"Q": "When an elderly person needs help performing daily tasks, who might they call?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) creativity (B) hatred (C) caregiver (D) own house (E) much money", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Caregiver.\nExplanation: When an elderly person needs help performing daily tasks, they might call a caregiver.

Bars often have TVs showing sports games, including hockey, and offer a variety of beers on tap or in bottles for patrons to enjoy while they watch. While it's possible to drink beer from a bottle or keep it in a refrigerator at home, the context of watching hockey suggests a social setting like a bar. Casinos may also have bars where people can watch sports games, but the focus of the question is on the activity of watching hockey, not gambling."}}
{"Q": "Where is there a telephone book in almost every room?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) at hotel (B) house (C) library (D) bedsit (E) closet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. at hotel.\nExplanation: Hotels typically provide a telephone book in almost every room for the convenience of their guests.

The countryside is typically characterized by open spaces, farmland, and rural areas, making it the most plausible answer from the given choices. While Kansas and meadows may also have green fields, they are not as commonly associated with driving as the countryside. Farmland and rural areas are also more specific to the type of landscape where green fields are likely to be seen."}}
{"Q": "Some people got escorted out of the library, they were probably what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) state facts (B) talking loudly (C) making money (D) amount to nothing (E) believe in god", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. talking loudly.\nExplanation: The fact that these people were escorted out of the library suggests that they were causing a disturbance.

Forests may have ponds, but they are usually deeper in the woods and not as easily accessible. A pond in a bathroom or on the ground would be highly unlikely. A rural area is also a possibility, but the term \"countryside\" is a more specific and fitting description."}}
{"Q": "Blowfish require what specific thing to live?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sea water (B) hatred (C) fish market (D) body of water (E) jungle", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. body of water.\n\nExplanation: Blowfish are aquatic animals and require a body of water to live. They are typically found in saltwater environments such as oceans and seas, but some species can also be found in freshwater rivers and lakes. Sea water (A) is a type of body of water, but not the only one blowfish can live in. Hatred (B) and jungle (E) are not relevant to the survival of blowfish.

Appliance store.\nExplanation: The presence of washers and refrigerators in the showroom suggests that it is a place where appliances are sold. An appliance store is a more plausible answer than the other options given, such as a car dealership or electronics store, which typically do not sell washers and refrigerators. The option of \"kitchen\" is also unlikely as it is not a typical location for a showroom. Therefore, the most likely answer is an appliance store."}}
{"Q": "The man often made smart remarks, like that any restaurant is a mexican restaurant where?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) city (B) mexica (C) san diego (D) spain (E) mexico", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. city\nExplanation: The statement \"any restaurant is a Mexican restaurant\" is a play on words, implying that Mexican cuisine is so popular and widespread that it can be found in any type of restaurant, regardless of its original cuisine. This statement could apply to any city, not just Mexico or San Diego. Therefore, option A, city, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I am looking for honey right from the source, where should I look?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) last all night (B) beehive (C) farmer's market (D) jar (E) honeyful", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) beehive\nExplanation: If you are looking for honey right from the source, the most plausible option would be to look for a beehive. Beehives are where honey is produced by bees, and you can often find local beekeepers who sell their honey directly from their hives. This way, you can be sure that the honey is fresh and unprocessed, and you can even learn more about the beekeeping process from the source. While farmer's markets may also sell local honey, it may not be as fresh as honey straight from the beehive."}}

A rabbit warren provides the perfect environment for a weasel to hunt and catch rabbits, which are a common prey for weasels. The other options, such as a tree, mulberry bush, chicken coop, and viking ship, do not provide the same type of environment for a weasel to hunt and catch prey."}}
{"Q": "What can disease destroy?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) rug (B) third world country (C) human body (D) hospital (E) building", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. human body\nExplanation: Diseases can attack and damage the human body, leading to illness, disability, and even death. While diseases can also have an impact on other things like agriculture or infrastructure, the destruction of the human body is the most significant and devastating consequence of disease."}}
{"Q": "What does a person from Avalon live in?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pain (B) meaningful work (C) english house (D) cotton candy (E) headache", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: English house.\nExplanation: Avalon is a legendary island in Arthurian legend, often associated with the British Isles. Therefore, it is likely that a person from Avalon would live in an English house, which is a traditional type of house found in England. Pain, meaningful work, cotton candy, and headache are not logical answers as they do not relate to the location or culture of Avalon."}}
{"Q": "Where is one likely to find a fan for their stove?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) appliance store (B) sports stadium (C) dress emporium (D) hot room (E) football stadium", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Appliance store.\nExplanation: A fan for a stove is a household appliance and can be found in stores that specialize in selling appliances for the home, such as an appliance store. The other options, such as a sports stadium, dress emporium, hot room, or football stadium, are not relevant to finding a fan for a stove."}}
{"Q": "Jodie felt a tightness in her chest. She was worried but didn't want to go to the hospital. Where might she go instead?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) istanbul (B) concert (C) bedroom (D) antique shop (E) human being", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Bedroom.\nExplanation: If Jodie is feeling a tightness in her chest, it could be a sign of a medical emergency. However, if she is hesitant to go to the hospital, the next best option would be to rest in a quiet and comfortable place like her bedroom. She can monitor her symptoms and if they persist or worsen, she can seek medical attention. Going to Istanbul, a concert, or an antique shop would not be appropriate in this situation, and a human being alone cannot provide medical assistance."}}
{"Q": "If you're buying beer for a float trip what are you preparing to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) get arrested (B) have fun (C) get sick (D) spend money (E) stupidity", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. have fun.\nExplanation: Buying beer for a float trip typically means that you are preparing to have a fun time floating down a river or stream with friends or family. It is a popular activity during the summer months and can be a great way to enjoy the outdoors and relax. While excessive drinking can lead to getting sick or making poor decisions, the act of buying beer for a float trip itself does not necessarily imply that."}}
{"Q": "Piece of land in Canada where you can find marmot?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) north america (B) united states (C) vancouver island (D) american (E) cage", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Vancouver Island.\nExplanation: Vancouver Island is a large island off the west coast of Canada, known for its diverse wildlife. One of the animals that can be found on the island is the marmot, a type of ground squirrel. While marmots can also be found in other parts of North America, including the United States, Vancouver Island is a specific location in Canada where they can be found. Option E, \"cage,\" is not a plausible answer as marmots are wild animals and not typically kept in cages."}}
{"Q": "The surgeon's clients had begun to reduce, it seemed girls no longer want to what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) reduction (B) make larger (C) augment (D) gain weight (E) expand", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. augment\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the surgeon's clients had begun to reduce, which means that they were not coming to the surgeon as frequently as before. The phrase \"it seemed girls no longer want to\" implies that there has been a change in the demand for the surgeon's services. The only option that fits this context is \"augment,\" which means to make something larger or more substantial. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C. augment, as it suggests that girls are no longer interested in getting breast augmentation surgery."}}
{"Q": "While waiting for this appointment, people often read magazines.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) doctor (B) train station (C) newsagent (D) market (E) table", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Doctor.\nExplanation: People often have to wait for their turn to see the doctor, and reading magazines is a common way to pass the time. Train stations and newsagents may also have magazines available, but they are not necessarily associated with waiting for an appointment. Markets and tables are unlikely places to find magazines for reading while waiting."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a fox that is made up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) storybook (B) woods (C) hen house (D) natural habitat (E) back yard", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. storybook\nExplanation: A fox that is made up is not a real animal and therefore cannot be found in its natural habitat, the woods, or a hen house. It is more likely to be found in a storybook where fictional creatures and characters are created. The back yard is also an unlikely location for a made-up fox."}}
{"Q": "In basic training they build you up only to do what, all in hopes of building you up even stronger the next time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) destroying (B) tear down (C) raze (D) mutilate (E) demolition", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tear down.\nExplanation: Basic training is designed to push individuals to their physical and mental limits in order to break down any preconceived notions or weaknesses they may have had. This tearing down of the individual is done in order to build them up stronger and more resilient for future challenges. The other options, such as destroying, razing, mutilating, or demolition, are too extreme and do not accurately reflect the purpose of basic training."}}
{"Q": "Billy saw a dog running from him and did his best to get away from it.  The leaped up to where the dog couldn't reach and was stuck.  Where might he have been trapped?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) kennel (B) table (C) porch (D) backyard (E) park", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) table\nExplanation: If Billy leaped up to where the dog couldn't reach him, it is likely that he climbed onto a higher surface. Out of the given options, a table seems like the most plausible choice for a higher surface that a person could climb onto to escape a dog. A kennel, porch, backyard, or park would not provide a high enough surface for someone to climb onto and get stuck."}}
{"Q": "John and Judy were parents.  They had two wonderful kids who weren't always well behaved.  They were light tough, though.  They felt it was a parent's job to do what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) control children (B) guide children (C) speak freely (D) cry (E) understand children", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Guide children.\nExplanation: While parents may feel the need to control their children's behavior, it is important to remember that children are individuals with their own thoughts and feelings. Instead, parents should aim to guide their children towards making good choices and developing positive behaviors. This involves setting clear expectations, providing support and encouragement, and modeling appropriate behavior themselves. By guiding their children in this way, parents can help them grow into responsible, independent adults."}}
{"Q": "What are you playing if you're fiddling on a violin?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bluegrass music (B) make music (C) drop (D) string instrument (E) troubles", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: String instrument.\nExplanation: Fiddling on a violin means playing a string instrument called a violin. The term \"fiddling\" is often associated with playing folk or country music, but the instrument itself can be used to play a wide variety of genres."}}
{"Q": "If somebody buys something and gives it to me as a free gift, what is the cost status of the gift?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) deadly (B) imprisoned (C) paid for (D) expensive (E) in prison", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. paid for.\n\nExplanation: If somebody buys something and gives it to you as a free gift, it means that they have already paid for it. Therefore, the cost status of the gift is \"paid for.\" The other options, such as \"deadly,\" \"imprisoned,\" \"expensive,\" and \"in prison,\" do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Why does someone flirt with many people at once?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) have sex (B) get laid (C) were lonely (D) attract attention (E) dance", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. attract attention.\n\nExplanation: Some people may flirt with multiple people at once to feel desired and attract attention. They may enjoy the feeling of being wanted and may not necessarily be looking for a sexual encounter. Flirting can be a way to boost one's self-esteem and feel more confident in social situations."}}
{"Q": "James tore the antenna off of his boat due to bad reception as he was crossing the channel from France.  Where was he going?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) river (B) television (C) india (D) england (E) europe", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: James was crossing the channel from France, which is a body of water that separates France and England. Therefore, it is more plausible that he was going to England."}}
{"Q": "Why would a band be performing when there are no people nearby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) record album (B) play music (C) hold concert (D) blaring (E) practice", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. record album\nExplanation: It is common for bands to perform in a recording studio to record their music for an album, even if there are no people nearby. This allows them to focus on the quality of their performance without the distractions of a live audience."}}
{"Q": "The dogs were protecting their own when they decided to what the bad man?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) bad breath (B) defend (C) run fast (D) ocean (E) attack", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. defend\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the dogs were protecting something that belonged to them, which implies that they were defending their territory or possessions. Therefore, the most plausible answer is \"defend.\" The other options, such as \"bad breath,\" \"run fast,\" \"ocean,\" or \"attack,\" do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What is used to grind wheat for bread?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) farmer's field (B) countryside (C) cereal packets (D) bread (E) mill", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Mill.\nExplanation: A mill is a machine that grinds grains into flour, which is then used to make bread. Farmers grow wheat in their fields, but it needs to be processed in a mill before it can be used for baking. The countryside is a general term for rural areas and does not relate specifically to the process of making bread. Cereal packets contain processed grains that have already been ground into flour, but they are not used to grind wheat for bread. Bread is the end product of the baking process and is not used to grind wheat. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E, mill."}}
{"Q": "If you have a large satchel with you when you fly you'll be asked to store it where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) airport (B) luggage compartment (C) with the pilot (D) room (E) clothing store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. luggage compartment\nExplanation: When flying, passengers are typically allowed to bring one carry-on bag and one personal item, such as a purse or small backpack. If a passenger has a large satchel that exceeds the size limit for a personal item, they will likely be asked to store it in the overhead luggage compartment or under the seat in front of them. It is not stored with the pilot or in a clothing store, and the airport and room options are too vague to be a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where would someone keep their nylon leggings?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) stockings (B) rope (C) car (D) clothing (E) drawer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. drawer\nExplanation: Nylon leggings are a type of clothing item, so it would make sense for someone to keep them in a clothing drawer. Stockings are a similar type of clothing item, but they are typically made of a different material and have a different style than leggings. Rope and a car are not logical places to store clothing items."}}
{"Q": "If you spend a long time running after a ball how are you likely to feel?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) laughter (B) sweating (C) embarrassed (D) breathing heavily (E) tiredness", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. tiredness\nExplanation: Running after a ball for a long time requires physical exertion and can lead to fatigue and tiredness. Sweating and breathing heavily are also likely physical responses to this activity, but tiredness is the most plausible answer as it is a common feeling after prolonged physical activity. Laughter and embarrassment are unlikely responses to this situation."}}
{"Q": "When you need to rest it's often because you have been doing what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) action (B) sleep (C) sleeping (D) in motion (E) using energy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: When you need to rest, it's often because you have been using energy. This can be physical energy from activities such as exercise or manual labor, or mental energy from tasks such as studying or problem-solving. Rest allows your body and mind to recover and replenish the energy that has been used."}}
{"Q": "Boredom and hunger led to a wandering waste of time and a cart full of unhealthy snacks during her trip to where?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) new moon (B) play cards (C) read book (D) see art (E) grocery shop", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. grocery shop\nExplanation: The mention of a \"cart full of unhealthy snacks\" suggests that the person went to a place where they could purchase food items. Among the given options, only grocery shopping fits this description. The other options do not involve the possibility of buying snacks or food items."}}
{"Q": "He was beginning to worry they wouldn't get on the ride before closing, they had been standing in queue for a long what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) frustration (B) waiting (C) hair (D) time (E) patience", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. time\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the person is worried about not being able to get on the ride before closing, which implies that they have been waiting in line for a long time. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D. time. The other options, such as frustration, hair, and patience, do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "This is an unavoidable physiological consequence of running.  What is it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) breathlessness (B) increased heart rate (C) falling down (D) muscle bulk (E) calluses", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Breathlessness is an unavoidable physiological consequence of running because when we run, our body requires more oxygen to produce energy, and we need to breathe faster and deeper to meet this demand. This increased breathing rate can lead to breathlessness, especially during intense or prolonged running. Increased heart rate is also a common consequence of running, but it is not necessarily unavoidable and can be controlled through training and conditioning. Falling down is not a physiological consequence of running but rather a risk associated with it. Muscle bulk can be a desirable outcome of running, but it is not an unavoidable consequence. Calluses can develop on the feet due to friction and pressure during running, but they are not a physiological consequence of running per se."}}
{"Q": "Sometimes a person has a fear of water or a dislike of being wet, it is still important to make sure they are having a bath why?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) flooding (B) drowning (C) wet skin (D) get wet (E) rash", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. wet skin\n\nExplanation: Even if a person has a fear of water or a dislike of being wet, it is still important to make sure they are having a bath to maintain good hygiene and keep their skin clean. Not bathing regularly can lead to skin infections, rashes, and other health problems. While flooding and drowning are not relevant in this context, getting wet can be uncomfortable for some people, but it is not a serious health concern. Therefore, option C, wet skin, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where would there be an auditorium with only a single person speaking?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) lights (B) crowd (C) university campus (D) theater (E) park", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) theater\nExplanation: A theater is a venue designed for performances, including plays, musicals, and lectures. It typically has an auditorium with a stage and seating for an audience. It is common for a single person, such as a speaker or performer, to be on stage speaking to the audience in a theater. Therefore, a theater is the most plausible option for an auditorium with only a single person speaking."}}
{"Q": "To get out of there the person had to keep on walking, they had to keep on what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) moving forward (B) locomotion (C) blisters (D) rollerskate (E) exercise", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. moving forward.\nExplanation: The phrase \"keep on walking\" implies that the person needs to continue moving in order to get out of there. Option A, \"moving forward,\" is the most plausible answer as it accurately reflects the need for the person to keep progressing in a particular direction. Options B, C, D, and E are not relevant to the context and do not make sense in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "What very large group of western citizens has bees everywhere?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) united states (B) space station (C) trash can (D) field of flowers (E) bouquet of flowers", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. United States.\n\nExplanation: Bees are found all over the United States, from urban areas to rural farmland. They play a crucial role in pollinating crops and plants, making them an important part of the ecosystem. While other options like the space station or a bouquet of flowers may have bees in certain circumstances, the United States is the most likely answer for a very large group of western citizens with bees everywhere."}}
{"Q": "Miss Grady took a stick from Bob because he was playing with it during class.  She wanted to make sure that he couldn't get to it so she put it where?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) desk drawer (B) kitchen drawer (C) classroom (D) pocket (E) office", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. classroom\nExplanation: Since Miss Grady took the stick from Bob during class, it is more plausible that she would keep it within the classroom rather than in her office or kitchen drawer. Keeping it in a desk drawer or her pocket may also not be secure enough to prevent Bob from getting it back. Therefore, the most likely option is that she kept it in the classroom where she could keep an eye on it and ensure that Bob couldn't access it during class."}}
{"Q": "How does a person begin reproducing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) genetic mutation (B) have sex (C) kiss (D) flirting (E) going on a date", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Have sex.\nExplanation: Reproduction in humans requires the fusion of a sperm and an egg, which occurs during sexual intercourse. Genetic mutation, kissing, flirting, and going on a date do not directly lead to reproduction. While these activities may be part of the process of finding a mate, they are not the actual act of reproduction. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B, have sex."}}
{"Q": "Joe and Jill didn't want their children to be sedentary.  They might limit the time they children spend doing what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) play sports (B) throw things (C) reading (D) watch tv (E) play with toys", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. watch TV.\n\nExplanation: Joe and Jill's concern about their children being sedentary suggests that they want their children to be physically active. Watching TV is a sedentary activity that does not require physical movement, so it is likely that they would limit the time their children spend doing this activity. The other choices, such as playing sports or throwing things, involve physical activity and would not be limited for the same reason. Reading and playing with toys are also not necessarily sedentary activities, so they may not be limited either."}}
{"Q": "They were making sauerkraut, the instructor explained the liquid should be above the cabbage in the what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) jar (B) drinking glass (C) pot (D) container (E) can", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. container\nExplanation: Sauerkraut is typically made in a container such as a crock or a large glass jar. The liquid, which is usually a mixture of salt and water, should be above the cabbage to ensure that the cabbage is fully submerged and can ferment properly. A drinking glass or can would be too small for making sauerkraut, and a pot may not be the best choice as it may not have a lid to keep out air and prevent contamination. Therefore, a container is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "From where would you normally take a cup when you're about to get a drink?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) dishwasher (B) water fountain (C) sand box (D) toilet (E) kitchen cabinet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. kitchen cabinet\nExplanation: A kitchen cabinet is a common place to store cups and other drinkware. It is a clean and appropriate location to take a cup from when getting a drink. The other options listed, such as the dishwasher, water fountain, sand box, and toilet, are not appropriate places to take a cup from for drinking."}}
{"Q": "What are you using if there are speakers strapped on your ears?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) take it all in (B) headphones (C) desktop (D) conference (E) concert", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Headphones.\nExplanation: If there are speakers strapped on your ears, it is most likely that you are using headphones. Headphones are a type of audio equipment that are worn over the ears to listen to music or other audio content. They come in different types such as over-ear, on-ear, and in-ear headphones."}}
{"Q": "Because of his anger he couldn't clearly explain or what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cool off (B) write letter (C) get mad (D) illustrate point (E) destroy enemy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. cool off\nExplanation: When someone is angry, their emotions can cloud their judgment and make it difficult for them to communicate effectively. Taking a break to cool off can help them calm down and approach the situation with a clearer mind. This can lead to better communication and a more productive resolution. Writing a letter or illustrating a point may also be helpful, but only after the person has had a chance to cool off and collect their thoughts. Getting mad or trying to destroy an enemy will only escalate the situation and make it worse."}}
{"Q": "Where is likely to not just have a kosher restaurant?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) jerusalem (B) jewish neighborhoods (C) dining in (D) new york city (E) dining", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. dining\nExplanation: It is possible to find kosher restaurants in many places, including Jerusalem, Jewish neighborhoods, and New York City. However, the option \"dining\" is not a specific location and therefore cannot be considered a place where a kosher restaurant is unlikely to be found."}}
{"Q": "The bald eagle flew from Mount St Helen's to the Puget Sound and all over what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) washington state (B) utah (C) pacific northwest (D) northern california (E) the desert", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Pacific Northwest.\nExplanation: The bald eagle is a bird of prey commonly found in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which includes Washington state. Mount St. Helen's and the Puget Sound are both located in this region, making it the most plausible answer. Utah, Northern California, and the desert are not part of the Pacific Northwest region and are unlikely places for a bald eagle to fly all over."}}
{"Q": "Where could you get some knives if you are planning to bring them outside with you?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sporting goods store (B) backpack (C) kitchen (D) sharp edges (E) dog house", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. sporting goods store\nExplanation: Sporting goods stores often sell knives that are suitable for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and hunting. These knives are designed to be durable and reliable in outdoor environments. It is important to note that laws and regulations regarding the possession and carrying of knives vary by location, so it is important to research and follow local laws and guidelines."}}
{"Q": "How can people fulfill their own calorie requirements?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) compete with each other (B) feed themselves (C) feel lonely (D) talk to each other (E) ask a doctor", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Feed themselves.\nExplanation: People can fulfill their own calorie requirements by feeding themselves with a balanced diet that includes carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. They can also monitor their calorie intake and adjust their diet accordingly to meet their specific needs. Competing with others, feeling lonely, talking to others, or asking a doctor may not directly help in fulfilling one's calorie requirements."}}
{"Q": "What does a stove do to the place that it's in?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) cool house (B) warm room (C) gas or electric (D) burn child (E) brown meat", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. warm room\nExplanation: A stove is designed to generate heat, whether it is a gas or electric stove. Therefore, it will warm up the room it is in. It is important to ensure proper ventilation and safety measures to prevent any accidents or harm."}}
{"Q": "What is the best way to begin going into trance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) religious experience (B) closed eyes (C) loss of control (D) sleep (E) hallucination", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Closed eyes.\nExplanation: Closing your eyes is a common and effective way to begin going into trance. By shutting out external stimuli, you can focus your attention inward and become more receptive to suggestions and relaxation techniques. This can help you enter a state of deep relaxation and altered consciousness, which is often associated with trance states. Additionally, closing your eyes can help you visualize and imagine different scenarios or experiences, which can further enhance your trance experience."}}
{"Q": "A computer user working on an important work assignment is located in what structure?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) office building (B) internet cafe (C) house (D) school (E) internet cafe", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. office building.\n\nExplanation: An office building is a more plausible answer as it is a common location for professionals to work on important assignments. It provides a professional environment with necessary equipment and resources to complete work efficiently. A house or school may not have the same level of resources and distractions may be present. While an internet cafe may have the necessary equipment, it may not provide the same level of privacy and security needed for important work assignments."}}
{"Q": "The music was festive but why are the horses dancing in circles", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) carnival (B) night club (C) theatre (D) opera (E) ringmaster", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. carnival\nExplanation: Horses dancing in circles is a common sight in carnivals and circuses where they are trained to perform tricks and entertain the audience. The festive music also supports the idea of a carnival atmosphere. Night clubs, theatres, and operas are unlikely places for horses to dance, and the ringmaster is a person who directs the performance rather than participates in it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "In the building where James worked there was a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats.  Where might James work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) theater (B) floors (C) concert hall (D) education (E) school", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A (theater)\n\nExplanation: The mention of an auditorium and the addition of a mezzanine to create more seating space suggests that James works in a theater. The other options, such as floors, education, or school, do not typically have auditoriums or mezzanines for seating arrangements. A concert hall is a possibility, but the mention of a mezzanine specifically for seating suggests a theater setting."}}
{"Q": "If you aren't well rested and it's a rainy day what might you do?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) sleep (B) write (C) make bread (D) stay in bed (E) enjoy film", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Enjoy film.\nExplanation: If someone isn't well rested, sleeping might not be an option or might not be the best solution. Making bread might require too much energy and effort. Staying in bed might prolong the feeling of tiredness. Writing might require too much concentration. On a rainy day, watching a film can be a relaxing and enjoyable activity that doesn't require much physical or mental effort. It can also provide a distraction from feeling tired and help pass the time."}}
{"Q": "Where would you have a stove if you don't live in a detached dwelling?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) tent (B) car (C) living room (D) friend's house (E) apartment", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. apartment\nExplanation: In an apartment, the most common place to have a stove would be in the kitchen. While it is possible to have a stove in a tent or car, it is not practical or safe. Having a stove in the living room or a friend's house would also be unusual and inconvenient. Therefore, an apartment is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What kind of place has a revolving door and has things to buy in it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) new york (B) public place (C) bank (D) mall (E) supermarket door", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Mall.\nExplanation: A mall is a public place that typically has a revolving door at its entrance and various stores where people can buy things. While a bank may have a revolving door, it typically does not have a wide variety of things to buy inside. Similarly, while a supermarket may have things to buy, it typically does not have a revolving door. New York is a city and not a specific place with a revolving door and things to buy. Therefore, the most plausible answer is a mall."}}
{"Q": "Where can books be read?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cabinet (B) backpack (C) table (D) shelf (E) sink", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. table\nExplanation: Books can be read on a table, which provides a flat surface for the book to rest on and allows the reader to sit comfortably.

It grows in shallow waters along coastlines and can also be found in deeper waters. While seaweed may wash up on beaches, it is not typically found alive on the beach itself. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (A) ocean."}}
{"Q": "If a lizard is fed by people every day, what has happened to it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) documentary (B) costa rica (C) garden (D) encouragement (E) captivity", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Captivity.\nExplanation: When a lizard is fed by people every day, it is likely that it is being kept in captivity, either as a pet or in a zoo or other controlled environment. In the wild, lizards would not rely on humans for food and would hunt and forage for themselves. Therefore, the fact that it is being fed by people suggests that it is not living in its natural habitat and is instead being kept in captivity."}}
{"Q": "What will happen to someone if his or her spirits cannot elevate?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sadden (B) demote (C) depress (D) drop (E) decrease", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. depress\nExplanation: If someone's spirits cannot elevate, it means they are unable to feel happy or positive.

{"Q": "If you wanted a license to catch crabs, what government office would you go to?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) most offices (B) fish department (C) fancy restaurant (D) government submarine (E) chesapeake bay", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Fish department.\nExplanation: The fish department is responsible for managing and regulating fishing activities, including the issuance of licenses for crabbing. They have the authority to set rules and regulations for crabbing, such as catch limits and seasons, to ensure the sustainability of crab populations. Therefore, if you wanted a license to catch crabs, you would need to go to the fish department."}}
{"Q": "What furniture will you normally find near a side chair?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) bedroom (B) table (C) wheel barrow (D) building (E) office", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. table\nExplanation: A side chair is typically used for seating in a living room, dining room, or office setting. It is common to find a table near a side chair, such as a coffee table, end table, or accent table, for placing drinks, books, or other items. A bedroom or building may have a side chair, but it is less likely to have a table nearby. A wheelbarrow is not a piece of furniture and would not be found near a side chair."}}
{"Q": "Metal is used to make what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) junkyard (B) ore (C) instruments (D) metal fabrication shop (E) bowls", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. instruments\nExplanation: Metal is commonly used to make musical instruments such as guitars, drums, trumpets, and saxophones. These instruments require a strong and durable material that can withstand the pressure and tension of playing. Metal is also used in the construction of other instruments such as pianos and harps. While metal can be used in the construction of junkyards, ore, metal fabrication shops, and bowls, these options are less likely than instruments."}}
{"Q": "What is the word added to Manchester that signifies what county it is in?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) england (B) united kingdome (C) lancashire (D) greater manchester (E) cheshire", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. lancashire\nExplanation: The word added to Manchester that signifies what county it is in is Lancashire. Manchester is a city in the northwest of England and is historically a part of the county of Lancashire. While Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county that includes Manchester and other surrounding areas, the word \"Greater\" is not typically added to the city's name. Therefore, the correct answer is Lancashire."}}
{"Q": "The program kept getting errors, the amateur end user began to what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) get mad (B) compile (C) debug (D) write code (E) get frustrated", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. debug\nExplanation: When a program keeps getting errors, the logical next step for an amateur end user would be to try to identify and fix those errors, which is known as debugging. Getting mad or frustrated may be emotional responses, but they are not productive solutions to the problem. Compiling and writing code may be necessary steps in the debugging process, but they are not the first step. Therefore, option C, debug, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John knew that the sun produced a massive amount of energy in two forms.  If you were on the surface of the sun, what would kill you first?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) ocean (B) heat (C) life on earth (D) wrinkles (E) light", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If you were on the surface of the sun, the extreme heat would kill you first. The temperature on the surface of the sun is around 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit), which is hot enough to vaporize most materials. The heat would cause your body to quickly disintegrate, making it impossible to survive for even a few seconds."}}
{"Q": "Lawyers often talk in front of an audience where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) work (B) courtroom (C) office building (D) press charges (E) theatre", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Courtroom.\nExplanation: Lawyers often speak in front of an audience in a courtroom, where they present their arguments and evidence to a judge or jury. This is a crucial part of the legal process, as it allows both sides to make their case and for a fair decision to be reached. While lawyers may also speak in other settings such as their office building or at work, the most common and important place for them to address an audience is in the courtroom. Press charges and theatre are not relevant to this context."}}
{"Q": "James bought a new set of tire chains and put them somewhere he could find them.  Where would he put them?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) gear shift (B) garage (C) kitchen (D) jewelry store (E) hardware store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. garage\nExplanation: It is more likely that James would store his tire chains in his garage, where he keeps his car and other automotive equipment. The garage is a common place to store car-related items, including tire chains, so it is the most plausible answer. The other options, such as the gear shift, kitchen, jewelry store, and hardware store, are not logical places to store tire chains."}}
{"Q": "If I wanted to eat something that is made from plants and needs to be washed, what would it be?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) roots (B) millions of cells (C) see work (D) leaves to gather light (E) flowers on", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Leaves to gather light.\nExplanation: Leaves are the primary organs of photosynthesis in plants, and they need to be washed before consumption to remove any dirt or pesticides. Roots (A) may also need to be washed, but they are not typically eaten raw. Millions of cells (B) and see work (C) do not make sense in the context of the question. Flowers (E) are not typically washed before consumption and are not a common food item."}}
{"Q": "Ficus can be planted in a yard to make summer more bearable, what sort of areas do they create?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) shady places (B) screened porch (C) pots (D) ceramics (E) clay pot", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. shady places\nExplanation: Ficus trees are known for their ability to provide shade due to their large, dense foliage. Planting them in a yard can create cool and comfortable areas for people to relax in during hot summer days. Pots, ceramics, clay pots, and screened porches are not necessarily associated with the benefits of planting ficus trees in a yard."}}
{"Q": "Children's behavior is a direct reflection of their what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) parents (B) old people (C) play ball (D) many adults (E) grown ups", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. parents\nExplanation: Children's behavior is heavily influenced by their parents, as they are the primary caregivers and role models in a child's life. Parents have a significant impact on a child's upbringing, including their values, beliefs, and behaviors. Children often model their behavior after their parents, so it is important for parents to set a positive example and provide guidance and discipline when necessary."}}
{"Q": "Most people who are family like to greet each other with a what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) apartments (B) listen to music (C) have friends (D) know what ophiolites (E) hug", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Hug\nExplanation: Hugging is a common way for family members to greet each other. It is a physical expression of affection and can help strengthen family bonds. While some families may have different customs or traditions for greeting each other, hugging is a widely recognized and accepted way to show love and affection. The other options, such as apartments, listening to music, having friends, and knowing about ophiolites, are not typically associated with family greetings."}}
{"Q": "John bought a new water hose.  But he found his old one near his car.  Where did he find the old one?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) garden shed (B) hardware store (C) greenhouse (D) garage (E) in a van", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. garage.\n\nExplanation: It is more likely that John would find his old water hose in his garage, where he stores his tools and other outdoor equipment, rather than in a garden shed, greenhouse, hardware store, or van."}}
{"Q": "Where is a control room needed to prevent wide spread disaster?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) airbase (B) prison (C) mill (D) nuclear plant (E) recording studio", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. nuclear plant\nExplanation: A control room is needed in a nuclear plant to monitor and control the various systems and processes involved in generating nuclear power. Without proper monitoring and control, a nuclear plant can pose a significant risk to public safety and the environment. In the event of an emergency, the control room is crucial in preventing a widespread disaster by allowing operators to quickly respond and take appropriate actions to mitigate the situation. Therefore, a control room is essential in a nuclear plant to ensure safe and efficient operation."}}
{"Q": "Where do you keep your pizza slice before you eat it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) table (B) plate (C) restaurant (D) oven (E) popular", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. plate\nExplanation: It is common practice to place a pizza slice on a plate before eating it. This allows for easier handling and prevents any toppings or sauce from spilling onto the table or floor. While a restaurant may provide a plate, it is also common to use one's own plate at home. The oven is where the pizza is cooked, and \"popular\" is not a relevant option in this context."}}
{"Q": "Everybody was changing into costumes in the dressing room, it was almost time to take the what stage?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) theater (B) train (C) bathhouse (D) dwelling (E) actors and actresses", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. theater\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that everyone was changing into costumes in a dressing room, which is typically associated with a theater or a performance venue. The use of the word \"stage\" also supports this idea. Choices B, C, and D are unlikely because they do not fit the context of the sentence, and choice E is not a location where one would typically take a stage. Therefore, A. theater is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The homeowner frowned at the price of gas, what did he have to do later?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) own home (B) mail property tax payments (C) board windows (D) cut grass (E) receive mail", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. cut grass\nExplanation: The homeowner's frown at the price of gas suggests that he is concerned about the cost of fuel. Cutting grass requires the use of a lawnmower, which runs on gasoline, so the homeowner may be hesitant to do this task due to the cost of fuel. The other options (own home, mail property tax payments, board windows, receive mail) do not seem to be directly related to the cost of gas."}}
{"Q": "A thoroughfare meandered through fields and woods, where was it passing though?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) move about (B) city (C) country (D) town (E) new york city", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. country.\n\nExplanation: The word \"thoroughfare\" typically refers to a road or street that is used for transportation, and the fact that it is passing through fields and woods suggests that it is located in a rural or natural setting. Choices A, B, D, and E all suggest more urban or built-up environments, so C, country, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "If I want a new ottoman, where should I go?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) furniture store (B) parlor (C) turkey (D) living room (E) den", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. furniture store.\nExplanation: A furniture store is the most plausible option for finding a new ottoman. Ottomans are a common piece of furniture and can be found in most furniture stores. A parlor is a room in a house, not a place to buy furniture. Turkey is a country and not a place to buy furniture. Living room and den are rooms in a house, not places to buy furniture."}}
{"Q": "Sean was leaving work and took the roadway that led to his what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) neighborhood (B) city (C) fate (D) countryside (E) maps", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. neighborhood\nExplanation: Since Sean was leaving work, it is more likely that he would take the roadway that leads to his neighborhood, where he lives, rather than the roadway that leads to a city or countryside. The option of maps is also unlikely as it is not a physical destination. The option of fate is metaphorical and does not make sense in this context. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What can you use to get a jellyfish?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) adriatic sea (B) mediterranean sea (C) hand (D) see (E) atlantic ocean", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. hand\nExplanation: Using your hand is the most plausible answer as it is the easiest and safest way to catch a jellyfish. The other options are bodies of water where jellyfish can be found, but they do not provide a method for catching them. Additionally, catching jellyfish in the wild can be dangerous as some species have stinging tentacles."}}
{"Q": "What has a shelf that does not allow you to see what is inside of it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) chest of drawers (B) stove (C) hold alcohol (D) bookcase (E) grocery store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. bookcase\nExplanation: A bookcase typically has shelves that are closed on three sides, with only the front side open for access to the books. This design is meant to protect the books from dust and other elements, but it also means that you cannot see what is inside the shelf without physically opening it. The other options (chest of drawers, stove, hold alcohol, and grocery store) do not typically have shelves that are designed to be closed off from view."}}
{"Q": "What will likely happen after stabbing to death a person?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) gruesome (B) being arrested (C) pool of blood (D) mess (E) grisly", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. being arrested.\nExplanation: Stabbing someone to death is a serious crime and is punishable by law. The perpetrator will likely be caught and arrested by law enforcement. The other choices, such as gruesome, pool of blood, mess, and grisly, may also be true, but being arrested is the most plausible outcome."}}
{"Q": "The boat passenger was explaining his fear of blowfish, but the captain figured he meant piranhas since they were on a river in the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) cuba (B) styx (C) atlantic ocean (D) france (E) jungle", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. jungle\nExplanation: The mention of piranhas and blowfish suggests that they are on a river in a tropical or subtropical region where these fish are commonly found. Cuba and France are not typically associated with piranhas or blowfish, and the Styx is a mythical river in Greek mythology. The Atlantic Ocean is not a river, so it is also an unlikely location for this scenario. The most plausible option is the jungle, which is known to have rivers with piranhas and blowfish."}}
{"Q": "Where could you find only a few office?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) skyscraper (B) new york (C) school building (D) city (E) work", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. school building\nExplanation: School buildings typically have only a few offices, such as the principal's office, guidance counselor's office, and administrative offices. Skyscrapers and cities, on the other hand, are likely to have many offices, while New York and work are not specific enough locations to determine the number of offices present."}}
{"Q": "Where can I go to be a religious gentleman?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) club (B) restaurant (C) university (D) pub (E) church", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Church\nExplanation: A church is a place of worship and spiritual guidance, making it the most plausible option for someone seeking to be a religious gentleman. It provides a community of like-minded individuals who share similar beliefs and values, and offers opportunities for prayer, reflection, and service to others. Additionally, many churches offer programs and events specifically geared towards men's spiritual growth and development."}}
{"Q": "I want to see a prepared slide up close, what would I use to help?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) microscope (B) abbreviate (C) glasses (D) camera (E) telescope", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. microscope\nExplanation: A microscope is the most appropriate tool for viewing a prepared slide up close. It allows for magnification and resolution of the specimen on the slide, making it easier to observe and study its details. Glasses, a camera, and a telescope are not suitable for this task, and abbreviate is not a tool but a verb meaning to shorten a word or phrase."}}
{"Q": "Where can you buy a magazine, paper or gum?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) bank (B) rack (C) bed (D) newsstand (E) bus depot", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D (newsstand)\nExplanation: A newsstand is a common place to buy magazines, newspapers, and gum. Banks and bus depots may have vending machines or small convenience stores, but they are not typically known for selling these items. Racks could refer to a variety of things, but it is not clear what type of rack is being referred to in this context. Bed is not a plausible answer as it is not a place where one would typically buy these items."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get some wood if you do not have any?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) carpet (B) boat (C) river (D) lumberyard (E) synagogue", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. lumberyard\nExplanation: A lumberyard is a place where wood is sold and can be purchased for various purposes such as construction, furniture making, and firewood. It is a more plausible answer compared to the other options as carpet, boat, and synagogue do not provide wood, and a river may have driftwood but it may not be suitable for all purposes."}}
{"Q": "The pitcher felt stress and tension on the mound, what did he feel like?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) desert (B) baseball field (C) hell (D) baseball diamond (E) baseball stadium", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. baseball diamond.\n\nExplanation: The term \"mound\" refers to the raised area in the center of the baseball diamond where the pitcher stands. Therefore, it would make sense for the pitcher to feel stress and tension on the baseball diamond, rather than in a desert, baseball field, hell, or baseball stadium."}}
{"Q": "What negative effect can competing in a chess game on a cold day have?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) enemies (B) perform better (C) sweat (D) tension (E) frostbite", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. tension\n\nExplanation: Competing in a chess game on a cold day can cause tension due to the discomfort of the cold weather. This tension can affect a player's ability to focus and make clear decisions during the game. It is important for players to stay warm and comfortable in order to perform their best. The other options, such as enemies, performing better, sweating, and frostbite, are not directly related to the negative effect of competing in a chess game on a cold day."}}
{"Q": "Why is it hard for a young child to read a long book?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) knowledge (B) cover (C) no pictures (D) past (E) many words", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. no pictures\nExplanation: Young children often rely on pictures to help them understand the story and keep them engaged. Without pictures, they may struggle to visualize the characters and events in the book, making it harder for them to stay interested and comprehend the story. Additionally, long books may be overwhelming for young children who are still developing their reading skills and attention spans."}}
{"Q": "On a hot day what can you do to enjoy something cool and sweet?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) dive (B) cool off (C) fresh cake (D) go for swim (E) eat ice cream", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. eat ice cream.\nExplanation: Eating ice cream is a common and enjoyable way to cool off and satisfy a sweet tooth on a hot day. It is a refreshing treat that can be enjoyed alone or with friends and family. Diving or going for a swim may also be enjoyable, but may not always be feasible or accessible. Fresh cake may not necessarily be a cool and refreshing option on a hot day. Therefore, eating ice cream is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What is likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) last word (B) conclusion (C) ikea instructions (D) afterword (E) epilogue", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Afterword.\n\nExplanation: An afterword is a section that appears at the end of a book and is written by someone other than the author. It typically provides additional information about the book, its creation, or its impact. A foreword, on the other hand, is written by someone who is closely connected to the book, such as the author's friend or editor, and appears at the beginning of the book. A conclusion is the final section of a book that summarizes the main points and often offers some final thoughts or recommendations. IKEA instructions are not typically found in books, and an epilogue is a section that appears at the end of a book and provides closure to the story."}}
{"Q": "How many hours are in a day?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) week (B) bright (C) night (D) twenty four (E) year", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. twenty four\nExplanation: There are 24 hours in a day, which is a well-known fact. Option A, week, is a unit of time that consists of seven days. Option B, bright, refers to the amount of light present during the day and is not a unit of time. Option C, night, refers to the period of darkness between sunset and sunrise and is also not a unit of time. Option E, year, is a unit of time that consists of 365 days (or 366 in a leap year)."}}
{"Q": "Why is religion so hard to understand?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) both positive and negative (B) unknowable (C) important to people (D) ocean (E) confusing", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. important to people.\nExplanation: Religion is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses various beliefs, practices, and traditions. It is often deeply ingrained in people's cultural, social, and personal identities, making it an essential aspect of their lives. Therefore, understanding religion requires not only intellectual curiosity and critical thinking but also empathy, respect, and openness to different perspectives and experiences. While religion may be challenging to comprehend fully, recognizing its significance to individuals and communities can help foster mutual understanding and dialogue."}}
{"Q": "The couple explained they were having trouble communicating, it seemed every conversation took great what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) thinking (B) effort (C) laugh (D) force (E) medium", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. effort.\n\nExplanation: The word \"trouble\" implies that the couple is struggling with something, and the fact that \"every conversation took great\" suggests that it requires a lot of effort. The other options don't fit as well - \"thinking\" doesn't necessarily imply difficulty, \"laugh\" doesn't make sense in this context, \"force\" implies resistance or unwillingness, and \"medium\" doesn't fit the sentence structure. Therefore, \"effort\" is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What would a person need to do if his or her captain dies at sea?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) cross street (B) have a party (C) experience life (D) cross road (E) man crew", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Man crew.\nExplanation: If a captain dies at sea, the crew would need to take over the responsibilities of the captain to ensure the safety and navigation of the ship. This would include designating a new leader, assigning tasks, and making decisions as a team. The crew would need to work together to ensure the ship reaches its destination safely."}}
{"Q": "What do children require to grow up healthy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) need care (B) come home (C) fast food (D) watch television (E) wash dishes", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. need care.\nExplanation: Children require care from their parents or caregivers to grow up healthy. This includes providing them with nutritious food, ensuring they get enough sleep and exercise, taking them to regular check-ups with a doctor, and providing a safe and nurturing environment. Fast food and excessive television watching can have negative effects on a child's health, while washing dishes is not a requirement for their growth and development."}}
{"Q": "I house outside the center of a community is said to be where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) city (B) subdivision (C) newspaper (D) residential area (E) street", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. residential area.\nExplanation: A residential area is a neighborhood or community where people live. Houses located outside the center of a community are typically situated in residential areas. The other options, such as city, subdivision, newspaper, and street, do not accurately describe the location of a house outside the center of a community."}}
{"Q": "The field general began to write out a letter to the king, he was told to send what when the enemy was near?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) syllable (B) english alphabet (C) word (D) email (E) invitation", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. word.\n\nExplanation: When the enemy is near, time is of the essence and there may not be enough time to write out a full letter. Therefore, the field general was likely instructed to send a single word as a signal to the king that the enemy was approaching. This would allow the king to quickly prepare for battle and take necessary precautions. Sending a syllable or the English alphabet would not convey any meaningful information, while sending an email or an invitation would not be possible in the context of the time period being referred to."}}
{"Q": "What will you put on a pen to prevent it from drying out?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) write sentences on paper (B) ink in (C) ink cartridges (D) caps (E) cling film", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Caps\nExplanation: Caps are the most common and effective way to prevent a pen from drying out. When not in use, simply replace the cap securely on the pen to prevent air from entering and drying out the ink. This will help to ensure that the pen remains usable for a longer period of time. While the other options may be useful for maintaining the pen's ink supply, they do not directly prevent the pen from drying out."}}
{"Q": "After climbing the mountains, the explored found the cave, what was the general goegraphy of the region he found it in?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) west virginia (B) kentucky (C) desert (D) sea (E) rocky hills", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. rocky hills.\n\nExplanation: The fact that the explorer climbed mountains before finding the cave suggests that the region is mountainous and hilly. The option of a desert or sea is unlikely since mountains and caves are not typically found in those environments. West Virginia and Kentucky are both known for their mountainous terrain and could be plausible options, but the description of \"rocky hills\" seems to fit better with E. rocky hills."}}
{"Q": "They dealt with combustible mixtures in their experiments, this is why they kept a fire extinguisher where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) hospital (B) chemistry lab (C) most businesses (D) classroom (E) public building", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. chemistry lab\nExplanation: Chemistry labs deal with various chemicals and substances that can be combustible or flammable. Therefore, it is common practice to keep a fire extinguisher in a chemistry lab to ensure safety in case of any accidents or mishaps. Hospitals, classrooms, most businesses, and public buildings may also have fire extinguishers, but they may not necessarily deal with combustible mixtures in their daily operations."}}
{"Q": "If someone mean wanted to insult somebody by calling them a fruit, where is probably not the smartest place to do it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) gay bar (B) market (C) grocery store (D) refrigerator (E) container", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. gay bar\nExplanation: Calling someone a fruit is often used as a derogatory term for gay men. Therefore, using this insult in a gay bar would not only be insensitive but also potentially dangerous. It could lead to a physical altercation or cause discomfort and harm to the LGBTQ+ community present in the bar. It is important to be mindful of the language we use and the spaces we are in to avoid causing harm or offense to others."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get a toothpick if you do not have any?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) box (B) grocery store (C) eyes (D) chewing (E) mouth", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. box\nExplanation: If you do not have any toothpicks, a more plausible option would be to look for a box of toothpicks. Many households keep a box of toothpicks in their kitchen or dining area. Alternatively, you could also look for toothpicks in a restaurant or café. While it is possible to use other methods such as chewing or using your fingers, these options may not be as effective or hygienic."}}
{"Q": "What would you be building if you designed a place for an annoying critter to stay?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) spread disease (B) swamp (C) fly away (D) cat condo (E) bug campers", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Cat condo.\nExplanation: A cat condo would be a suitable place for an annoying critter to stay because cats are natural predators and can help control the critter population. It would also keep the critter contained and prevent it from spreading disease or causing damage to the surrounding area. A swamp or bug campers would not be a suitable option as it would only encourage the critter to stay and potentially cause more problems. Fly away is not a relevant option as it does not provide a solution for the critter's accommodation."}}
{"Q": "The man working in the attic swatted away a bee, but soon the single bee was an entire what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) swarm (B) pack (C) countryside (D) soft drink (E) field of flowers", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A swarm.\nExplanation: When a bee is swatted, it releases a pheromone that signals other bees to come to its aid. This can quickly escalate into a swarm of bees attacking the person. Therefore, option (A) swarm is the most plausible answer. Options (B), (C), (D), and (E) are not related to the behavior of bees and are unlikely outcomes in this scenario."}}

This may include sturdy hiking boots, comfortable and moisture-wicking clothing, a hat for sun protection, and a backpack with essentials such as water, snacks, and a map. It is also important to consider the weather and terrain of the hiking trail when choosing what to wear. While physical exertion and fatigue may be experienced during the hike, a cast iron stomach and shin splints are not necessary clothing items."}}
{"Q": "What type of store would have lots of sports equipment?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) mall (B) office supply store (C) school (D) sporting goods store (E) sporting event", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. sporting goods store.\nExplanation: A sporting goods store specializes in selling sports equipment and gear, making it the most plausible option for a store with a lot of sports equipment. Malls may have some sporting goods stores, but they also have a variety of other stores. Office supply stores and schools do not typically sell sports equipment. Sporting events may have vendors selling sports equipment, but they are temporary and not permanent stores."}}
{"Q": "The business man was promoted recently, to celebrate he went where to buy an expensive wristwatch?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) case (B) jewelry store (C) shopping (D) jewelery box (E) hock", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) jewelry store.\nExplanation: A jewelry store is the most plausible option for the business man to buy an expensive wristwatch to celebrate his promotion. A jewelry store specializes in selling high-end watches and other jewelry items, making it the most likely place for him to find a suitable watch to mark his achievement. The other options, such as a case, shopping, jewelry box, or hock, are not relevant to buying a wristwatch."}}
{"Q": "How is a child eager to be going to play likely to get there?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) slowly (B) rush (C) being entertained (D) have fun (E) enjoyment", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. rush.\n\nExplanation: A child who is eager to go play is likely to rush to get there quickly and start having fun. They may be excited and full of energy, so they will want to get to their destination as soon as possible. Rushing can also be a sign of enthusiasm and anticipation, which are common emotions for children who are looking forward to playing."}}
{"Q": "There's some new buying products designed to get you money if you have none. The first step is that it will show you how to declare what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) tax return (B) bankruptcy (C) pleasure (D) debt (E) spending money", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (A) tax return because if someone has no money, they may need to file a tax return to receive a refund or other tax benefits. The product may show them how to properly declare their income and expenses to maximize their refund or reduce their tax liability. Bankruptcy and debt may be options for those with financial difficulties, but they are not necessarily the first step to take. Pleasure and spending money are not relevant to the situation of having no money."}}
{"Q": "Where can you buy a replacement ax handle?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) bathroom (B) hardware store (C) water fountain (D) grocery store (E) fridge", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. hardware store.\nExplanation: A hardware store is a more plausible option for buying a replacement ax handle as they typically carry a variety of tools and replacement parts. The other options, such as a bathroom, water fountain, grocery store, and fridge, are not relevant to purchasing an ax handle."}}
{"Q": "Is that person acting as silly as a clown?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) make mistakes (B) ridiculous (C) have no home (D) mentally unhinged (E) schizophrenia", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. ridiculous\nExplanation: The word \"silly\" in the question implies that the person is behaving in a foolish or absurd manner. Comparing them to a clown, who is known for their exaggerated and often ridiculous behavior, reinforces this idea. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the person is acting ridiculous. The other options do not fit the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "Which group of states is Louisiana part of?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) deep south (B) 98 of world's crayfish (C) united states (D) gulf states (E) bible belt", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Gulf states.\nExplanation: Louisiana is located in the southern region of the United States, along the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf states include Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. These states share a common history and culture, and are often grouped together for economic and political purposes. Therefore, it is more plausible that Louisiana is part of the Gulf states rather than the other options listed."}}
{"Q": "Where would you put a plate immediately after eating from it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) kitchen cupboard (B) floor (C) table (D) dishwasher (E) flea market", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) table\nExplanation: After eating from a plate, the most plausible place to put it would be on the table. This is because it is still within reach in case you need to use it again, and it is also a common practice to leave used plates on the table until everyone is finished eating. Putting it in the kitchen cupboard or dishwasher would be premature, as the plate may still be needed for additional servings or for cleaning up any spills. Putting it on the floor or flea market would be inappropriate and unsanitary."}}
{"Q": "James couldn't get comfortable.  There was too much dirt.  He needed to clean out what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) ground (B) subway (C) bank (D) bed (E) street", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: James couldn't get comfortable, which suggests that he was trying to sleep or rest. The fact that there was too much dirt implies that he was in a bed or some other sleeping surface. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (D) bed. The other options, such as ground, subway, bank, and street, are unlikely to be places where James would be trying to sleep or rest."}}
{"Q": "The rats were hiding in the house, where were they?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) sewers (B) laboratory (C) basement (D) clinic (E) cellar", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. basement\nExplanation: Rats are known to seek shelter in dark and secluded places, and a basement in a house would provide just that. Sewers and laboratories are not typically found in a house, and clinics and cellars may not be large enough to accommodate a significant number of rats. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the rats were hiding in the basement of the house."}}
{"Q": "What do people do when they don't understand something?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) ask questions (B) experience joy (C) believe in god (D) talk to each other (E) get sick", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. ask questions\nExplanation: When people don't understand something, the most common and effective way to gain clarity is by asking questions. This allows them to seek clarification, gather more information, and gain a better understanding of the topic. Asking questions is a natural and important part of the learning process, and it helps individuals to expand their knowledge and improve their understanding of the world around them."}}
{"Q": "James saw a kite flying in the sky.  He traced the string back to its origin and found it.  Where did the string begin?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) end of line (B) hobby shop (C) his hand (D) toy store (E) child's hand", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (E) child's hand\nExplanation: It is more likely that a child was flying the kite and holding onto the string, rather than the string magically appearing in James' hand or coming from a hobby shop or toy store. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the string began in a child's hand."}}
{"Q": "What rubber toy filled with helium will make a child happy?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) loved (B) learn (C) eat cake (D) balloon (E) become adult", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. balloon\nExplanation: A rubber toy filled with helium is commonly known as a balloon.

{"Q": "What can happen to you when you are using television and it is not interesting?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) turn off (B) functions (C) turning off (D) entertainment (E) fall asleep", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. turn off\nExplanation: When you are using television and it is not interesting, the most plausible thing to happen is that you will turn it off. This is because if the content is not engaging or entertaining, there is no reason to continue watching it. Turning off the television is a common response to uninteresting programming."}}
{"Q": "The business men left the discussion in the dressing room, now they just wanted to relax in the sauna of the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) brush hair (B) theater (C) house (D) dwelling (E) bathhouse", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. bathhouse\nExplanation: The context suggests that the businessmen were in a place where there is a dressing room and a sauna. The most plausible option from the given choices is a bathhouse, which typically has both facilities. A theater or a house would not have a sauna, and while a dwelling could have a sauna, it is not a common feature. Brushing hair is also not related to the context. Therefore, option E, bathhouse, is the most likely answer."}}
{"Q": "Where is a likely place for an ivy plant?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) flower pot (B) shelf (C) windowsill (D) outside (E) sill", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Outside.\n\nExplanation: Ivy plants are often used as ground cover or climbing plants in outdoor gardens or landscapes. They thrive in areas with partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. While they can also be grown indoors in a flower pot or on a windowsill, they may require more attention and care to ensure they receive enough light and water. Therefore, it is more likely to find an ivy plant outside in a garden or landscape setting."}}
{"Q": "Where has the newest baseball stadium?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) phoenix (B) chicago (C) antarctica (D) san francisco (E) urban areas", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. San Francisco.\nExplanation: The newest baseball stadium is Oracle Park, located in San Francisco, California. It opened in 2000 and is the home stadium of the San Francisco Giants. Phoenix, Chicago, and other urban areas have baseball stadiums, but they are not the newest. Antarctica does not have a baseball stadium."}}
{"Q": "What type of residence has a ground floor with a stoop?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) brownstone (B) hotel (C) condominium (D) entering building (E) office building", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. brownstone\nExplanation: A brownstone is a type of townhouse that is typically found in cities like New York and Boston. They are characterized by their brown sandstone facades and often have a ground floor entrance with a small set of steps leading up to a stoop or porch. This entrance typically leads to the main living area of the house. Hotels, condominiums, and office buildings may also have ground floor entrances, but they are less likely to have a stoop or porch. \"Entering building\" is too vague to be a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "If the wood texture is not smooth it is what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) gilded (B) porous (C) solid (D) painted (E) less dense than water", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. porous\nExplanation: If the wood texture is not smooth, it means that it has small holes or spaces on its surface, which makes it porous. Porous materials have small openings that allow air, water, or other substances to pass through them. Gilded means covered with a thin layer of gold, solid means having no holes or spaces, painted means covered with paint, and less dense than water means having a lower density than water, which is not related to the texture of wood."}}
{"Q": "What might happen if someone is not losing weight?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) loose skin (B) beauty (C) miss universe (D) death (E) healthier", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Healthier.\nExplanation: Not losing weight may indicate that the person is not following a healthy lifestyle, which can lead to various health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and more. Therefore, losing weight can improve overall health and reduce the risk of developing these health issues. However, loose skin or beauty are cosmetic concerns that may or may not occur, and missing the Miss Universe pageant or death are extreme and unlikely outcomes."}}
{"Q": "Billy lived in the capital of his country, then he moved.  Where might he move to?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) small town (B) jail (C) lower case (D) contain governmental activities (E) lowercase", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. small town\nExplanation: If Billy lived in the capital of his country, he might move to a small town for a change of pace or to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. Moving to jail or a place that contains governmental activities seems unlikely without further context, and \"lowercase\" is not a plausible option as it is a grammatical term and not a place."}}
{"Q": "Making a schedule was easy to pick, the major called for knowledge that required a certain what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) color (B) class (C) meeting (D) university (E) encyclopedia", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. class\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that making a schedule was easy, but the major required knowledge that was not as simple to acquire. The word \"class\" refers to a course of study, which is a common requirement for a major. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer among the given choices. The other options, such as color, meeting, university, and encyclopedia, do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "When getting in shape, this is something that does wonders?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) eat more (B) starve (C) give up (D) period of recovery (E) jogging", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. jogging\nExplanation: Jogging is a form of cardiovascular exercise that can help improve overall fitness and aid in weight loss. It can also improve heart health, increase endurance, and boost mood. While eating a balanced diet is important for overall health, simply eating more or starving oneself is not a sustainable or healthy way to get in shape. Giving up is also not a viable option. A period of recovery may be necessary after intense exercise, but it is not a solution for getting in shape."}}
{"Q": "What could prevent a driving car from continuing to drive?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) automobile accidents (B) backache (C) pollution (D) smoke (E) low fuel tank", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Automobile accidents.\n\nExplanation: Automobile accidents can cause damage to the car's engine, tires, or other parts, making it impossible for the car to continue driving. Backache, pollution, smoke, and low fuel tank may affect the driver's ability to drive or the car's performance, but they are unlikely to completely prevent the car from continuing to drive."}}
{"Q": "Where do you store a large container?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) supermarket (B) factory (C) juice (D) hostel (E) cabinet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. factory\nExplanation: A large container would typically be stored in a factory, as it is a place where goods are produced and stored. Supermarkets, juice, hostels, and cabinets are not typically equipped to store large containers."}}
{"Q": "What is a person likely to experience after they stop being married to a mean person?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) isolation (B) grief (C) happiness (D) relief (E) angry", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Relief.\n\nExplanation: After being married to a mean person, a person is likely to experience a sense of relief after the marriage ends. They may feel free from the constant negativity and emotional abuse that they may have experienced during the marriage. While they may also experience grief and anger, the feeling of relief is likely to be the most prominent emotion. Isolation may also be a possibility, but it is not necessarily a direct result of the end of the marriage. Happiness may come later, but it is not an immediate reaction to the end of a difficult marriage."}}
{"Q": "Despite the large crowds, how did the depressed man feel?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) small group (B) alone (C) solitary (D) solitude (E) panic", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. alone\nExplanation: Despite the large crowds, the depressed man felt alone, indicating that he did not feel connected or supported by those around him. The other options, such as small group, solitary, and solitude, suggest a lack of company or social interaction, but do not necessarily imply the feeling of being alone. Panic, on the other hand, suggests a state of extreme fear or anxiety, which may or may not be related to the man's emotional state."}}
{"Q": "Where does a maid empty a trash can?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) bus stop (B) corner (C) hockey game (D) motel (E) alley", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Motel.\nExplanation: A maid is most likely to empty a trash can in a place where she is employed, such as a motel. Options A, B, and E are public places where it would not be appropriate for a maid to empty a trash can. Option C, a hockey game, is also not a plausible answer as a maid would not be working at a sports event."}}
{"Q": "The dog curled up for a nap, it was tuckered out because it had just been what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) walked (B) petted (C) affection (D) go outside (E) scratch", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. walked\nExplanation: The phrase \"tuckered out\" is often used to describe someone or something that is exhausted or worn out from physical activity. Therefore, it is most likely that the dog is tired because it has just been taken for a walk. The other options, such as being petted, receiving affection, going outside, or being scratched, are not necessarily physically exhausting activities that would make the dog tired enough to curl up for a nap."}}
{"Q": "He used an umbrella while tanning, where was he likely?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) waves (B) seattle (C) suitcase (D) beach (E) jacket closet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. beach\nExplanation: It is common for people to use an umbrella while tanning on the beach to protect themselves from the sun's harmful rays. Waves (A) and Seattle (B) do not necessarily indicate a beach setting, while a suitcase (C) and jacket closet (E) are unlikely places to use an umbrella for tanning. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D. beach."}}
{"Q": "What do the feathers look like on birds found in the rainforest?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) pretty smart (B) singing (C) dark (D) very colorful (E) light", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) very colorful\nExplanation: Birds found in the rainforest often have very colorful feathers, which help them attract mates and blend in with their surroundings. These colors can range from bright blues and greens to deep reds and oranges. This adaptation is important for survival in the dense and diverse rainforest environment."}}
{"Q": "The ancient seafaring Norse tribesman brought pelts of weasel aboard his what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) rabbit warren (B) used car lot (C) chicken coop (D) cruise (E) viking ship", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. viking ship\nExplanation: The Norse tribesmen were known for their seafaring skills and their iconic Viking ships, which were used for trade, exploration, and raiding. It is plausible that they would have brought pelts of weasel aboard their ships as a valuable commodity for trade or for personal use. The other options (rabbit warren, used car lot, chicken coop, cruise) are not relevant or plausible in the context of ancient Norse seafaring."}}
{"Q": "What is the opposite of an area of elevation?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) disgust (B) reduction (C) depression (D) demotion (E) diminishment", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. depression\nExplanation: An area of elevation refers to a high point or raised area, while depression refers to a low point or sunken area. Therefore, C is the opposite of an area of elevation. A, B, D, and E are not related to the concept of elevation."}}
{"Q": "What do singers need to do before a show?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) warm up (B) use microphones (C) clear throats (D) create music (E) sound beautiful", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. warm up.\nExplanation: Singers need to warm up their vocal cords and muscles before a show to prevent strain and injury. This involves doing exercises such as scales, lip trills, and breathing exercises to prepare their voice for the performance. Using microphones and clearing throats may be necessary during the show, but warming up is essential before the performance. Creating music and sounding beautiful are also important, but they are not specific tasks that need to be done before a show."}}
{"Q": "When a person with mental illness receives medication and therapy, what has happened?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cause irrational behaviour (B) recur (C) effectively treated (D) managed (E) cause suffering", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. effectively treated.\nExplanation: When a person with mental illness receives medication and therapy, it means that they are receiving treatment for their condition. The goal of this treatment is to effectively manage their symptoms and improve their overall quality of life. Therefore, option C, effectively treated, is the most plausible answer. Options A, B, D, and E are not accurate because they do not reflect the positive outcomes that can result from receiving proper treatment for mental illness."}}
{"Q": "What type of feeling is performing for the first time likely to produce?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) action (B) butterflies (C) happiness (D) a sense of calm (E) anxiety", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (E) anxiety\n\nExplanation: Performing for the first time can be nerve-wracking and anxiety-inducing. It's natural to feel nervous and unsure of oneself when stepping onto a stage or in front of an audience for the first time. This feeling is commonly referred to as \"stage fright\" and can manifest as butterflies in the stomach, sweaty palms, and racing thoughts. While some performers may feel a sense of excitement or action, it's more likely that the initial feeling will be one of anxiety."}}
{"Q": "If someone is found to be committing murder, what did they do to someone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) misery (B) kill (C) distress (D) tickel (E) go to jail", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. kill.\nExplanation: If someone is found to be committing murder, it means they have unlawfully caused the death of another person. The act of killing is a serious crime and can result in severe legal consequences, including imprisonment or even the death penalty in some jurisdictions. Therefore, option B, \"kill,\" is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The computer was hooked up to the internet, what could it do as a result?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) process information (B) believe in god (C) make decisions (D) process information (E) receive data", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. receive data.\nExplanation: When a computer is connected to the internet, it can receive data from various sources such as websites, emails, and other online services. This data can be processed by the computer to perform various tasks, but the primary function of the internet connection is to allow the computer to receive information from the internet. Therefore, option E is the most plausible answer. Options A, C, and D are redundant as they all refer to the same function of processing information, and option B is irrelevant as a computer's internet connection has no bearing on its belief system."}}
{"Q": "The planet Mercury is unsuitable for human life or what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) toxic (B) uninhabitable (C) mercury sulphide (D) poisonous (E) jupiter", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. uninhabitable.\nExplanation: Mercury is unsuitable for human life because it is too close to the sun, causing extreme temperatures that range from -290°F (-180°C) at night to 800°F (430°C) during the day. Additionally, the planet has no atmosphere to protect from solar radiation and has a weak magnetic field, making it vulnerable to solar winds. These conditions make it impossible for humans to survive on Mercury without advanced technology and protective gear. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Mercury is uninhabitable."}}
{"Q": "Seeing idea become reality was a dream of hers for a long time, but as the time came to get on stage she had more what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) build (B) anxiety (C) celebrate (D) very nice (E) ocean", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. anxiety\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person had a dream of seeing their idea become a reality, which implies that they have been working towards it for a long time. However, as the time came to get on stage, the person had more anxiety, which is a common feeling when one is about to present their ideas or perform in front of an audience. Therefore, option B, anxiety, is the most plausible answer. Options A, C, D, and E do not fit the context of the sentence."}}

It is often found in a valley, which is a low area between hills or mountains where a stream or river flows. Therefore, option C, valley, is the most plausible answer. The other options, such as meadow, forest, stick, and countryside, do not necessarily indicate the presence of a creek."}}
{"Q": "Where off the eastern U.S. would you find an anemone?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) flower bed (B) tide pool (C) florida keys (D) coral sea (E) aquarium", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tide pool.\nExplanation: Anemones are marine animals that are commonly found in tide pools along the eastern coast of the United States. They attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces and use their tentacles to capture prey. While anemones can also be found in aquariums, flower beds and the Florida Keys are not likely places to find them in the wild. The Coral Sea is located off the coast of Australia and is not part of the eastern U.S."}}
{"Q": "Where are traveling clothes often kept?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) suitcase (B) bedroom (C) closet (D) draws (E) dresser", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. suitcase\nExplanation: Traveling clothes are often kept in a suitcase as it is specifically designed for storing clothes and other items for travel.

In order to prevent non-customers from using the bathroom, they may require a key or code to access it. Therefore, it is plausible that someone would need to buy something from the convenience store in order to obtain the key to the bathroom."}}
{"Q": "Although the sun did rise, what did the pessimist warn everyone it would do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) lay (B) go down (C) fall (D) below (E) sundown", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) fall\nExplanation: The word \"pessimist\" suggests that the person has a negative outlook on things. Even though the sun did rise, the pessimist might warn everyone that it will eventually fall or set, indicating that the day will end and darkness will come. Therefore, option (C) \"fall\" is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The hardcovers were especially tall, so he removed a shelf on the what to make room?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) chest of drawers (B) grocery store (C) hold alcohol (D) nightstand (E) bookcase", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. bookcase\nExplanation: Since the hardcovers were especially tall, it makes sense that the shelf that needed to be removed would be on a bookcase. A chest of drawers, grocery store, and nightstand are unlikely to have shelves that would be tall enough to accommodate the hardcovers. While a piece of furniture that holds alcohol may have shelves that are tall enough, it is not specified that the person needed to make room for alcohol. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E. bookcase."}}
{"Q": "If you're watching a comedy film what would you expect to hear from the audience?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) park (B) insight (C) being entertained (D) laughter (E) fear", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) laughter\nExplanation: Laughter is the most plausible answer as it is a common response to comedy.

However, not all of the food is used by the body and the waste products are eliminated through defecation. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E. defecating."}}
{"Q": "Where are you if you've paid to get a pizza?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) popular (B) baked in oven (C) restaurant (D) oven (E) plate", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. restaurant\nExplanation: If you've paid to get a pizza, it is most likely that you are in a restaurant where pizzas are served. While options A, B, D, and E may be related to pizza, they do not necessarily indicate a location where you would have paid for a pizza. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What would you use to find a place to stay?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) mexico (B) phone book (C) town (D) city (E) sun dial", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. phone book\nExplanation: The phone book is a directory of businesses and services, including hotels and motels, making it a useful tool for finding a place to stay. Mexico, town, and city are too broad and vague to be a specific method for finding lodging, while a sundial is not a practical tool for this purpose."}}
{"Q": "If you're seeking a connection for your laptop, what are you trying to hook up with?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) computer network (B) electrical circuit (C) lineage (D) company (E) wall", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. computer network\nExplanation: When seeking a connection for a laptop, one is usually trying to connect to a computer network, which allows the laptop to access the internet or other devices on the network. An electrical circuit or wall connection may be necessary for power, but it is not the same as a network connection. Lineage and company are not relevant to this context."}}
{"Q": "The child didn't know the problems his mother was going through, all he had was what for her?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) care (B) balloon (C) loved (D) become adult (E) learn", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. care.\n\nExplanation: The word \"problems\" suggests that the mother was going through some difficult times. The fact that the child didn't know about these problems indicates that the mother was likely trying to shield him from them. In this context, it is plausible that the child's main concern for his mother was to show her care and support, even if he didn't fully understand what was going on. The other options (balloon, loved, become adult, learn) do not fit as well with the given context."}}
{"Q": "To see new films you must?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) open eyes (B) go to movies (C) kick ball (D) make art (E) look for", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Go to movies.\nExplanation: To see new films, the most plausible option is to go to the movies. This is because new films are typically released in theaters before they are available for home viewing. While it is possible to watch new films through streaming services or on DVD/Blu-ray, going to the movies is the most common and traditional way to see new releases."}}
{"Q": "What can happen when you contemplate alone for a long time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) daydream (B) headache (C) get ideas (D) sleep (E) become distracted", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. get ideas.\nExplanation: When you contemplate alone for a long time, you give your mind the opportunity to wander and explore different thoughts and ideas. This can lead to new insights and perspectives, and may even spark creative solutions to problems. While daydreaming and becoming distracted are also possible outcomes, a headache or sleepiness are less likely unless you are physically uncomfortable or sleep-deprived."}}
{"Q": "The pioneer went to the general store for storage measures, what was he looking for?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) checkers (B) barrels (C) baking soda (D) buffalo (E) salt", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. barrels\nExplanation: The pioneer went to the general store for storage measures, which suggests that he needed something to store goods in. Checkers, baking soda, and buffalo are not storage measures, while salt could be stored in barrels but it is not a measure of storage itself. Barrels, on the other hand, are commonly used for storing various goods such as food, liquids, and even gunpowder during pioneer times. Therefore, B. barrels is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I was apprehensive to buy the expensive equipment to play a game with so much walking and swinging around in grass, but now I understand why people what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) care less (B) play golf (C) shake hands (D) believe in god (E) trip over", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. play golf\nExplanation: The statement mentions \"walking and swinging around in grass,\" which are both activities commonly associated with playing golf. Therefore, it is likely that the expensive equipment being referred to is golf equipment. The statement also suggests that the speaker was initially hesitant to invest in this equipment, but now understands why people do so, which implies that they have come to enjoy playing golf."}}
{"Q": "What can a newspaper be used to do to an engagement?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) announce (B) communicate (C) educate (D) inform (E) cancel", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. communicate\nExplanation: A newspaper can be used to communicate information about an engagement, such as the date, time, and location of the event. It can also provide details about the couple, their families, and any other relevant information. Additionally, a newspaper can be used to share engagement announcements and photos with a wider audience."}}
{"Q": "John needed a straight wire.  Unfortunately, this one had endured some abuse and had become what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bent (B) bent (C) crooked (D) straightforth (E) curved", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The word \"crooked\" means not straight or bent out of shape, which fits the description of the wire that has endured some abuse. Therefore, option (C) is the most plausible answer. Option (A) is a synonym of bent, which is already listed as a choice, making it unlikely to be the correct answer. Option (B) is a duplicate of option (A) and can be eliminated for the same reason. Option (D) is not a word that describes the wire's condition, and option (E) suggests a specific type of curve, which may not be accurate."}}
{"Q": "Metal is taken from what which is pulled from the ground?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) dirt (B) instruments (C) ore (D) car (E) junkyard", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. ore\nExplanation: Metal is typically extracted from ore, which is a naturally occurring mineral or rock that contains a high enough concentration of metal to make it economically feasible to extract. The ore is usually mined from the ground and then processed to extract the metal. While metal can be found in other sources such as recycled materials, the primary source of metal is from ore."}}
{"Q": "When not in use where on your property would you store you bucket?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) utility closet (B) outside (C) well (D) garden shed (E) garage", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) garden shed\nExplanation: Storing a bucket outside or in a well may expose it to the elements and cause damage or rust. Storing it in a utility closet or garage may take up valuable space needed for other items. A garden shed provides a secure and dry location for storing a bucket, while also keeping it easily accessible for when it is needed."}}
{"Q": "What does someone do to relax at night?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) find time (B) check mail (C) listen to music (D) go to bed (E) stop worrying", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. listen to music.\nExplanation: Listening to music is a common way to relax at night. It can help to calm the mind and reduce stress levels, making it easier to fall asleep. Checking mail or finding time may not necessarily be relaxing activities, and going to bed or stopping worrying may be the end goal but not necessarily an activity to do to relax."}}
{"Q": "Where might the stapler be if I cannot find it?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) office building (B) office supply store (C) desk drawer (D) with dwight (E) desktop", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. desk drawer.\nExplanation: The most likely place for a stapler to be is in a desk drawer, as it is a common storage location for office supplies. While it is possible that the stapler could be in an office building or an office supply store, these options are less likely as they are not specific locations where an individual would typically keep their personal stapler. Additionally, the option of the stapler being on someone's desktop or with Dwight assumes specific circumstances that are not provided in the question."}}
{"Q": "Many homes in this country are built around a courtyard. Where is it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) candidate (B) spain (C) lawn (D) asshole (E) office complex", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Spain.\nExplanation: Spain is known for its traditional architecture that often includes homes built around a central courtyard, known as a \"patio\" in Spanish. This design allows for privacy, natural light, and ventilation, and is commonly found in regions with warm climates. Therefore, option (B) Spain is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sean was a wreck.  He  loved to build houses, but in his current state, he couldn't do what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) stand up (B) produce (C) construct (D) make (E) build", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. construct\nExplanation: The sentence states that Sean loved to build houses, but he was currently a wreck. This implies that he is not in a good state to construct or build houses. Therefore, option C, which means to construct, is the most plausible answer. Options A, B, D, and E do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What would be happening if you are pretending to be a police officer?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) fighting (B) misunderstanding (C) deception (D) play (E) distrust", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. deception\nExplanation: Pretending to be a police officer involves deceiving others into believing that you have the authority and power of a law enforcement officer. This is a form of deception and can have serious legal consequences. It is important to always be truthful about your identity and not impersonate a police officer."}}
{"Q": "Where would you buy a finely crafted writing instrument?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) nasa (B) classroom (C) stationery store (D) purse (E) office supply store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. stationery store.\nExplanation: A stationery store is a more plausible answer as it specializes in selling writing materials such as pens, pencils, and other writing instruments. These stores often carry a variety of high-quality writing instruments, including finely crafted ones. NASA, classroom, purse, and office supply stores are not likely to carry such items."}}
{"Q": "The detective was finding information from witnesses, why would he do that?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) fun (B) ulcers (C) get answers (D) happiness (E) power", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. get answers.\nExplanation: The detective's job is to solve a crime, and one of the ways to do that is by gathering information from witnesses. This information can help the detective piece together what happened, identify suspects, and ultimately solve the case. It is not likely that the detective is doing this for fun, happiness, or power, and in fact, the stress of the job may even lead to ulcers. Therefore, the most plausible reason for the detective to be finding information from witnesses is to get answers."}}
{"Q": "Joe found spiders in the place where he keeps his tools.  Where might that be?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cupboard (B) toolbox (C) closet (D) garage (E) mail box", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. toolbox\nExplanation: Spiders are commonly found in dark and secluded areas, such as inside a toolbox. Cupboards and closets are also possible locations, but they are less likely to be associated with tools. A garage is a larger space and may have more areas for spiders to hide, while a mailbox is too small and unlikely to be a place where tools are kept."}}
{"Q": "While on the fan boat he thought he'd see swamps and gators, but he was surprised to spot a bald eagle in what nature area?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) everglades (B) high places (C) natural habitat (D) new york (E) colorado", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. everglades\nExplanation: The Everglades is a famous nature area in Florida known for its swamps and alligators. It is also home to a variety of bird species, including the bald eagle. Therefore, it is more plausible that the bald eagle was spotted in the Everglades while on a fan boat. The other options, such as high places, natural habitat, New York, and Colorado, do not provide a specific location or environment where one would expect to see a bald eagle in the wild."}}
{"Q": "Where are you likely to find a supermarket?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) buy food for family (B) city or town (C) get supplies (D) strip mall (E) vermont", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. city or town.\nExplanation: Supermarkets are typically located in urban or suburban areas where there is a high population density and demand for groceries. While supermarkets may also be found in strip malls or other commercial areas, the most likely place to find a supermarket is in a city or town. Supermarkets are where people go to buy food for their families and get supplies, making them an essential part of many communities. Vermont is not a likely answer as it is a state and not a specific location where a supermarket can be found."}}
{"Q": "Where would you need to use a lantern?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) grocery store (B) antique shop (C) house (D) dark place (E) street", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. dark place\nExplanation: A lantern is typically used in a dark place where there is no or limited source of light. This could include camping trips, power outages, or outdoor activities at night. It would not be necessary in a grocery store, antique shop, or house where there is already sufficient lighting. While a lantern could be used on a street, it would depend on the lighting conditions and whether or not there are streetlights available."}}
{"Q": "What area does a police officer patrol?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) direct traffic (B) city (C) beat (D) street (E) park", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. beat\nExplanation: A police officer typically patrols a designated area known as their beat. This can be a specific neighborhood or section of a city that they are responsible for monitoring and responding to any incidents or emergencies that may occur. While they may direct traffic or patrol streets and parks within their beat, the beat itself encompasses a larger area."}}
{"Q": "Why would a woman kill a stranger she met in a dark alley?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) being raped (B) get rid of (C) they didn't know the passcode (D) get revenge (E) were evil", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. being raped\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a woman would kill a stranger she met in a dark alley if she was being raped or felt threatened with sexual assault. This is a common scenario where women may resort to self-defense to protect themselves from harm. The other options such as getting rid of, not knowing the passcode, getting revenge, or being evil are less likely to be the motive for killing a stranger in a dark alley."}}
{"Q": "The baby was cranky, it needed to eat breakfast but refused to what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) buy food (B) open mouth (C) get out of bed (D) cry (E) wake up", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. open mouth.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the baby needed to eat breakfast, but refused to do something. The most logical action that the baby could refuse to do in this situation is to open its mouth to eat. The other options, such as buying food or getting out of bed, are not relevant to the baby's immediate needs in this scenario. Crying or waking up could be symptoms of the baby's crankiness, but they do not directly address the issue of the baby's refusal to eat breakfast."}}
{"Q": "What is made up of people?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) buildings (B) audience (C) apartment (D) classroom (E) falling down", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Audience.\nExplanation: An audience is made up of people who are gathered to watch or listen to a performance or presentation. Buildings, apartments, and classrooms are physical structures that can contain people, but they are not made up of people themselves. \"Falling down\" is not a valid answer as it is not a noun that can be made up of people."}}
{"Q": "He was afraid he would die from his cold, so he wisely decided to what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) ocean (B) write will (C) never want (D) were shot (E) seek help", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. seek help\nExplanation: If someone is afraid they will die from a cold, seeking medical help would be the most logical and wise decision. Going to a doctor or seeking medical attention can help alleviate symptoms and prevent the cold from turning into a more serious illness. Choosing options like writing a will or going to the ocean would not address the immediate health concern and would not be considered a wise decision in this situation."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get a pen if you do not have one?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) briefcase (B) desk drawer (C) friend's house (D) pocket (E) sidewalk", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) friend's house\nExplanation: If you do not have a pen, it is more plausible to ask a friend if they have one that you can borrow. It is unlikely that you would find a pen in a briefcase or desk drawer if you do not have access to those items. While it is possible to find a pen in your pocket, it is not guaranteed. Finding a pen on the sidewalk is also unlikely. Therefore, asking a friend for a pen is the most reasonable option."}}
{"Q": "Why would a small dog pant if it's hot outside?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) outside (B) europe (C) heat (D) wet (E) dog show", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. heat\nExplanation: Dogs pant to regulate their body temperature and cool themselves down. When it's hot outside, a small dog may pant more frequently or heavily to release heat and prevent overheating. This is a natural and necessary behavior for dogs in hot weather."}}
{"Q": "She asked her little boy why, he replied that he didn't know and it was just what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) case (B) reason (C) how (D) because (E) answer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. because\nExplanation: The little boy's response indicates that he doesn't have a specific reason for his actions, but rather is doing something without a clear motive. The word \"because\" is often used to explain a reason or justification for an action, but in this case, the boy is saying that there is no clear reason for his behavior."}}
{"Q": "Where would you display a picture on a horizontal surface?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) microwave (B) desktop (C) shelf (D) art show (E) wall", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. shelf\nExplanation: A shelf is a horizontal surface that is specifically designed to display items such as pictures, books, and decorative objects. It is a common place to display pictures in a home or office setting. A microwave is not a suitable surface for displaying pictures as it is meant for cooking food. A desktop may be used to display pictures, but it is not as common as a shelf. An art show is a temporary exhibition space for artwork, and a wall is a vertical surface for hanging pictures, not a horizontal surface."}}
{"Q": "What skill is needed for riding a bike?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) wheels (B) feet (C) pedalling (D) practice (E) good balance", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: Good balance is a crucial skill needed for riding a bike. Without it, the rider may fall off the bike and get injured. While wheels, feet, pedalling, and practice are all important components of riding a bike, they are not the primary skill needed to ride a bike successfully."}}
{"Q": "He looked at the field of pumps, all slowing churning oil out of the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) manual (B) street (C) restaurant (D) ground (E) service station", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. ground\nExplanation: The context suggests that the pumps are churning oil out of the ground, which is a common location for oil extraction. The other options (manual, street, restaurant, service station) do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The department to where vendors deliver goods for sale is called what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) delivered (B) take away (C) receiving (D) pick up (E) keep", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. receiving.\nExplanation: The department where vendors deliver goods for sale is typically called the receiving department. This is where the goods are received, checked for quality and quantity, and then distributed to the appropriate departments or areas for sale or storage. The other options, such as delivered, take away, pick up, and keep, do not accurately describe the department where vendors deliver goods for sale."}}
{"Q": "Where is the worst place to be in a ticket office?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) at the top (B) movie theaters (C) train station (D) end of line (E) opera house", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. End of line.\nExplanation: Being at the end of the line in a ticket office means that you have to wait the longest to be served. This can be frustrating, especially if you are in a hurry or if the line is moving slowly. Additionally, if the ticket office is busy, there may be a higher chance of tickets selling out before you reach the front of the line. Therefore, the end of the line is the worst place to be in a ticket office."}}
{"Q": "Exercise is very good for you, for faster recovery you should always do what afterwards?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) stretch (B) lower cholesterol (C) weigh (D) track (E) expend energy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Stretching after exercise helps to increase blood flow to the muscles, reduce muscle soreness, and improve flexibility. It also helps to prevent injury and improve overall performance during future workouts. Lowering cholesterol, weighing, tracking, and expending energy are all important for overall health, but they are not specifically related to faster recovery after exercise."}}
{"Q": "What happens when you go somewhere and forget something at home?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) arriving (B) arrive there (C) turn around (D) go back (E) fart", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. go back\nExplanation: If you forget something at home while on your way to a destination, the most logical thing to do is to go back home and retrieve the item. This will ensure that you have everything you need for your trip or activity. Turning around or farting are not viable options in this situation."}}
{"Q": "Where would you acquire a wind instrument for you own use?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) band practice (B) concert (C) music store (D) symphony (E) music room", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Music store.\nExplanation: A music store is the most plausible option for acquiring a wind instrument for personal use. Band practice, concerts, symphonies, and music rooms are all places where wind instruments may be played, but they are not typically places where instruments are sold. A music store, on the other hand, specializes in selling musical instruments and would have a variety of wind instruments available for purchase."}}
{"Q": "Where would a person light alcohol on fire to observe the reaction?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) supermarket (B) bar (C) pub (D) restaurants (E) chemistry lab", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. \nExplanation: Lighting alcohol on fire is a common experiment in chemistry labs to observe the reaction and properties of the substance. It is not safe or appropriate to do so in public places like supermarkets, bars, pubs, or restaurants, where it could potentially cause harm or damage. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E, the chemistry lab."}}
{"Q": "If a storey contained a panoramic view, what kind of structure would it be in?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) horizontal room (B) storey book (C) mall (D) tall building (E) book of stories", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Tall building.\n\nExplanation: A panoramic view typically refers to a wide and unobstructed view of the surrounding area. This type of view is often associated with tall buildings, such as skyscrapers or observation towers, that offer a high vantage point. Therefore, a storey containing a panoramic view would most likely be found in a tall building. Choices A, B, and E are not relevant to the context of the question, and a mall may or may not have a panoramic view depending on its location and design."}}
{"Q": "Where does lettuce arrive by large trucks?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) kitchen (B) supermarket (C) farmer's market (D) salad (E) refrigerator", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Supermarket.\nExplanation: Lettuce is typically transported by large trucks to supermarkets where it is sold to consumers. While lettuce may also be sold at farmer's markets, it is unlikely that it would be transported by large trucks to these smaller venues. The kitchen and refrigerator are not locations where lettuce would arrive by truck, and \"salad\" is not a location at all. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B. Supermarket."}}
{"Q": "Why do people who are dying receive social security payments?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) rejuvenation (B) born again (C) no longer exist (D) unable to work (E) change of color", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Unable to work.\nExplanation: Social security payments are designed to provide financial support to individuals who are no longer able to work due to age, disability, or other reasons. People who are dying may be unable to work due to their medical condition, and therefore may be eligible for social security payments."}}
{"Q": "What should I do with a jumping rope?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) fatigue (B) sweating (C) get tired (D) tiredness (E) hopping", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Hopping.\nExplanation: Jumping rope involves hopping over a rope that is swung over the head and under the feet. Therefore, the most plausible answer is \"hopping.\" The other options, such as fatigue, sweating, getting tired, and tiredness, are all potential outcomes of jumping rope, but they do not describe what one should do with a jumping rope."}}
{"Q": "What do geese do every fall in fields?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) guard house (B) fly (C) eat (D) follow ultralight airplane (E) group together", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Geese are known to migrate during the fall season, and one of their activities during this time is to eat in fields to build up their fat reserves for the long journey ahead. Therefore, choice (C) \"eat\" is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I took my seat, the curtains drew back and I enjoyed the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) airplane (B) movie (C) auditorium (D) theatre (E) show", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. theatre\nExplanation: The context suggests that the person is sitting in a place where curtains are drawn back, which is a common feature in a theatre. The other options like airplane, movie, auditorium, and show do not fit the context as well as theatre does. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D. theatre."}}
{"Q": "What should everyone do who doesn't want to fight anymore?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) explicate (B) pay tribute to king (C) hope for peace (D) wear shoes (E) do well", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. hope for peace.\nExplanation: If someone doesn't want to fight anymore, the best option is to hope for peace. This means that they should strive for a peaceful resolution to any conflicts or disagreements they may have with others. It is important to remember that violence and aggression only lead to more violence and aggression, and that peace can only be achieved through understanding, compromise, and mutual respect. By hoping for peace, individuals can work towards creating a more harmonious and peaceful world for themselves and others."}}
{"Q": "Where is the ideal location for a post office?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) building (B) business district (C) above ground (D) most towns (E) center of town", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. center of town\nExplanation: The center of town is the most convenient location for a post office as it is easily accessible to all residents and businesses in the area. It is also a central location for mail carriers to distribute mail to surrounding neighborhoods. Additionally, having a post office in the center of town can help to stimulate local economic activity as people may visit nearby shops and restaurants while running errands at the post office."}}
{"Q": "Where outside of a city would a squirrel live?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) roof (B) inside home (C) forest (D) yard (E) park", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. forest\nExplanation: Squirrels are wild animals that typically live in natural habitats such as forests, woodlands, and parks. While they may occasionally venture into urban areas, they are more likely to build their nests in trees and other natural structures found in their natural habitats. Therefore, it is more plausible for a squirrel to live in a forest than on a roof, inside a home, or in a park. While they may also inhabit yards, this is not as common as living in a forest."}}
{"Q": "You should watch out for snakes if floating down what African body of water?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) wet grass (B) western texas (C) high grass (D) amazon river (E) tree", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. High grass.\nExplanation: Snakes are known to inhabit areas with high grass, as it provides them with cover and protection. Therefore, if you are floating down a body of water in Africa and there is high grass along the banks, you should watch out for snakes. The other options, such as wet grass, western Texas, the Amazon River, and trees, are not necessarily associated with snake habitats in Africa."}}
{"Q": "At the end of the day as he began to eat he paused and thanked her, it wasn't often she would what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cook dinner (B) did chores (C) make food (D) stretch out (E) get food", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. cook dinner\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person is thanking someone for something they did for him before he began to eat. Since the sentence mentions \"cook dinner,\" it is most likely that the person is thanking the person for cooking the meal. The other options, such as \"did chores\" or \"get food,\" do not fit the context of the sentence as well."}}
{"Q": "To what do trees roots cling?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) yard (B) orchard (C) museum (D) countryside (E) surface of earth", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. surface of earth\nExplanation: Tree roots typically cling to the surface of the earth in order to anchor the tree and absorb nutrients and water from the soil. While trees can grow in various environments such as yards, orchards, countryside, and even near museums, their roots will still primarily cling to the surface of the earth. Therefore, option E is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What probably has a lot of dust in the back?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) closet (B) door (C) corner (D) shelf (E) library", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Closet.\n\nExplanation: Closets are often used to store clothing, shoes, and other items that can shed fibers and create dust. Additionally, closets are often not cleaned as frequently as other areas of the home, leading to a buildup of dust over time. Therefore, it is more plausible that a closet would have a lot of dust in the back compared to a door, corner, shelf, or library."}}
{"Q": "At the new comic store he found himself making friends, it was nice to meet people with what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) smiling (B) smile (C) open mind (D) common interests (E) laughter", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. common interests.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person found it nice to make friends at the new comic store. This implies that the people he met there shared similar interests in comics, which is why he found it easy to connect with them. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D, common interests."}}
{"Q": "The student explained he had a clue what neuroepithelium was and got really nervous, he then lost his balance because a what issue?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) tastebud (B) retina (C) inner ear (D) nasal cavity (E) autistic", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. inner ear\n\nExplanation: The inner ear is responsible for balance and equilibrium. Losing balance can be a symptom of inner ear problems such as vertigo or Meniere's disease. The student's nervousness and lack of understanding of neuroepithelium may have caused him to become dizzy and lose his balance."}}
{"Q": "What could people do that involves talking?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) confession (B) state park (C) sing (D) carnival (E) opera", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Confession.\nExplanation: Confession involves talking, specifically confessing one's sins or wrongdoings to a religious figure or therapist. It is a common practice in many religions and can also be a therapeutic tool for individuals seeking to address personal issues. State park, carnival, and opera may involve talking, but they are not primarily focused on verbal communication. Singing involves making sounds with the voice, but it is not necessarily a conversation or dialogue."}}
{"Q": "If you're a child answering questions and an adult is asking them that adult is doing what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) discussion (B) explaning (C) teaching (D) confusion (E) correct", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. teaching\nExplanation: When an adult is asking questions to a child, it is usually to help the child learn and understand something new. This process is commonly known as teaching, where the adult imparts knowledge and information to the child through questioning and explanation. Therefore, the most plausible answer is teaching."}}
{"Q": "He has lactose intolerant, but was eating dinner made of cheese, what followed for him?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) digestive (B) feel better (C) sleepiness (D) indigestion (E) illness", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. indigestion\n\nExplanation: Since the person is lactose intolerant, consuming dairy products like cheese can lead to indigestion, bloating, gas, and other digestive discomforts. Therefore, it is likely that the person experienced indigestion after eating dinner made of cheese."}}
{"Q": "The teacher played on the upright piano, she was explaining the song to all the students in the what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) music room (B) bathroom (C) house (D) living room (E) music store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. music room.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is A, music room, as it is a common place for music teachers to teach and play music for their students. The other options, such as bathroom, house, living room, and music store, are less likely as they are not typically used for music lessons or performances."}}
{"Q": "When you get an F, you fail. If you get A's you are?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) passed (B) completing (C) passed (D) passing (E) succeeding", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. passing.\nExplanation: Getting an F means failing, while getting A's means you are passing or achieving a high level of success in your studies. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D, passing."}}
{"Q": "What is the main purpose of having a bath?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cleanness (B) wetness (C) exfoliation (D) use water (E) hygiene", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. cleanness\nExplanation: The main purpose of having a bath is to clean oneself and remove dirt, sweat, and bacteria from the body. Bathing helps to maintain personal hygiene and prevent the spread of infections. While wetness and exfoliation may be secondary benefits of having a bath, the primary purpose is to get clean. Using water is a necessary component of bathing, but it is not the main purpose. Therefore, option A, cleanness, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The ball was hit over a boundary and struck an audience member.  What kind of game were they playing?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sporting event (B) sporting (C) basketball (D) society (E) ranch country", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. sporting event\nExplanation: The fact that a ball was hit over a boundary suggests that it was a game with defined boundaries, which is common in many sports. Additionally, the fact that an audience member was struck suggests that it was a game with spectators, which is also common in many sports. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that they were playing a sporting event."}}
{"Q": "What is someone operating a vehicle likely to be accused of after becoming inebriated?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) punish (B) arrest (C) automobile accidents (D) drunk driving (E) talking nonsense", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. drunk driving.\n\nExplanation: When someone becomes inebriated while operating a vehicle, they are likely to be accused of drunk driving. This is a serious offense that can result in legal consequences such as fines, license suspension, and even imprisonment. It is important to never drink and drive, and to always have a designated driver or alternative transportation if planning to consume alcohol."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get jewelry if you do not have any?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) vault (B) suitcase (C) neighbour's house (D) department store (E) safe deposit box", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. department store.\nExplanation: A department store is a common place to purchase jewelry. It offers a wide variety of options and styles to choose from, making it a convenient and accessible option for those who do not have any jewelry. The other options, such as a vault, suitcase, neighbour's house, or safe deposit box, are unlikely sources for obtaining jewelry."}}
{"Q": "What is a philosopher waiting for to eventually gain through his studies?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) job (B) boredom (C) anxiety (D) impatience (E) wisdom", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. wisdom\nExplanation: Philosophers study to gain knowledge and understanding of the world and human existence. The ultimate goal of their studies is to gain wisdom, which is the ability to apply their knowledge and understanding to make wise decisions and live a fulfilling life. While a philosopher may eventually find a job related to their field, this is not the primary motivation for their studies. Boredom, anxiety, and impatience are unlikely to be the driving forces behind a philosopher's pursuit of knowledge and wisdom."}}
{"Q": "What do young boys do on the ice in the winter?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) ski (B) play hockey (C) summer (D) knit (E) warm", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. play hockey.\nExplanation: Hockey is a popular winter sport for young boys, especially in colder regions where there is access to ice rinks or frozen ponds. Skiing is also a popular winter activity, but it may not be as common among young boys as hockey. Summer and knitting are not related to winter activities on the ice. \"Warm\" is not a plausible answer as it is not an activity."}}
{"Q": "She loved spending money at the thrift store on knickknacks, this resulted in a lot of what on every shelf in her house?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) poverty (B) clutter (C) getting (D) satisfaction (E) more happiness", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. clutter.\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the woman enjoys buying small, decorative items from thrift stores. As a result, her house is likely to be filled with many of these items, leading to clutter on every shelf. The other options, such as poverty, getting, satisfaction, and more happiness, do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "I listened to lecture intensely, what is my goal?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) gain confidence (B) concentrate (C) get attention (D) pay attention (E) stop talking", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. pay attention.\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"listened to lecture intensely\" suggests that the goal was to focus and concentrate on the lecture, which is synonymous with paying attention. The other options, such as gaining confidence or getting attention, do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "If a person is using a computer to talk to their granddaughter, what might the computer cause for them?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) program created (B) stress (C) happiness (D) ocean (E) headache", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. happiness.\n\nExplanation: The computer can provide a means for the person to communicate with their granddaughter, which can bring joy and happiness to both parties. It can also allow them to share photos, videos, and other memories, which can further enhance their relationship. While there may be some stress associated with using technology, such as learning how to use the computer or dealing with technical issues, the overall impact is likely to be positive. The options of \"program created,\" \"ocean,\" and \"headache\" are not relevant or plausible in this context."}}
{"Q": "Joe was there to meet a large number of people.  As he filed though the entrance hall, he saw many strangers who came from far away.  What sort of building is he probably in?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) person (B) box (C) convention center (D) public building (E) large building", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. convention center.\n\nExplanation: The description of Joe meeting a large number of people who came from far away suggests that he is in a place where events or gatherings are held. A convention center is a large building designed to host events such as conferences, trade shows, and exhibitions, and it is likely that Joe is attending one of these events. Choices A and B are not plausible as they do not fit the description of a building where large gatherings are held. Choice D is too broad and could refer to any public building, while choice E is too vague and does not provide any specific information about the type of building Joe is in."}}
{"Q": "John wanted scatter his wife's remains in a lake in the wilderness.  He had to delay before of where he lived.  Where did he live?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) mountains (B) dead body (C) pay debts (D) state park (E) new york", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) mountains\nExplanation: The fact that John wanted to scatter his wife's remains in a lake in the wilderness suggests that he lived in an area with mountains and lakes. Option (D) state park could also be a possibility, but the use of the word \"wilderness\" implies a more remote and natural location. Option (B) dead body and (C) pay debts are not relevant to the question. Option (E) New York is too broad and does not provide any specific information about the location. Therefore, option (A) mountains is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Many towns and cities have trash cans where on sidewalks?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) hospital (B) park (C) corner (D) motel (E) office", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. park\nExplanation: It is common for towns and cities to have trash cans placed on sidewalks near parks, as people often generate waste while enjoying outdoor activities. Hospitals, motels, and offices may have their own designated waste disposal systems, while corners may not be the most convenient or accessible location for trash cans."}}
{"Q": "The family wanted to adopt for enviro-ethical reasons, what did they abhor?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) orphan (B) biological child (C) give away (D) foster child (E) abandon", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. abandon\nExplanation: The family's desire to adopt for enviro-ethical reasons suggests that they are concerned about the impact of overpopulation on the environment. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would want to contribute to the problem by having a biological child or giving away a child they already have. Similarly, fostering a child would not necessarily reduce the overall population. Adopting an orphan would be a positive action, but it is not necessarily related to environmental concerns. However, adopting a child who has been abandoned would prevent that child from becoming a burden on the environment and would provide a loving home for a child in need."}}
{"Q": "What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) stall (B) start melting (C) taxi (D) crash (E) speed up", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. crash\nExplanation: If airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight, the airplane will lose power and altitude. Without power, the airplane will eventually lose lift and stall, causing it to crash. In some cases, the airplane may be able to glide to a safe landing, but this depends on factors such as altitude, airspeed, and distance to a suitable landing site. However, in most cases, a loss of engine power in flight is a serious emergency that requires immediate action to attempt to restart the engines or find a suitable landing site."}}
{"Q": "Where would you be concerned about finding a cavity?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) solid object (B) molar (C) dentist (D) unbrushed tooth (E) teeth", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Molar\nExplanation: Molars are the teeth located at the back of the mouth that are used for grinding and chewing food. They have many grooves and crevices that can trap food particles and bacteria, making them more susceptible to decay and cavities. Therefore, finding a cavity in a molar would be a cause for concern and would require prompt dental treatment."}}
{"Q": "Human beings learn about current events from what print item?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) question authority (B) melt (C) read newspapers (D) act (E) dictionary", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. read newspapers.\n\nExplanation: Newspapers are a common and widely used print item for learning about current events. They provide up-to-date information on local, national, and international news, as well as opinions and analysis from journalists and experts. While other print items like books and magazines may also cover current events, newspapers are specifically designed to provide timely and relevant news coverage. Therefore, it is more plausible that human beings learn about current events from reading newspapers."}}
{"Q": "In what kind of environment does an anemone live?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) nursery (B) south pacific (C) desert (D) sea water (E) atlantic ocean", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. sea water\nExplanation: Anemones are aquatic animals that live in the sea water. They are commonly found in coral reefs, rocky shores, and tide pools. They have a symbiotic relationship with clownfish, which live among their tentacles for protection. Anemones cannot survive in a nursery, desert, or the South Pacific or Atlantic Ocean, as they require a specific environment with access to sea water."}}
{"Q": "He wanted lodging in the actual what, so that he was already where he needed to be?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) a yurt (B) resort area (C) big city (D) michigan (E) going on vacation", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. big city\nExplanation: The phrase \"so that he was already where he needed to be\" suggests that the person has a specific destination or purpose in mind. A big city would offer a variety of options for lodging and would likely be the location of the person's desired destination, whether it be for business or personal reasons. A yurt or resort area may not be practical for this purpose, and \"going on vacation\" is too broad and does not provide a specific location. \"Michigan\" is also too specific and does not provide enough context to determine if it is the desired location."}}
{"Q": "If I am suffering from boredom, and I want to see something beautiful, what should I do?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) see art (B) see ghost (C) watch film (D) grocery shop (E) do crossword puzzle", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. See art.\nExplanation: Seeing art can be a great way to alleviate boredom and experience beauty. Art can be found in many forms, such as paintings, sculptures, and installations, and can be viewed in museums, galleries, or even public spaces. Art can evoke emotions, inspire creativity, and provide a sense of wonder and awe. Additionally, viewing art can be a great way to learn about different cultures and historical periods. Overall, seeing art is a more plausible answer than the other options listed."}}
{"Q": "The goal was to hit the target, but a projectile ball can't hit anything if it isn't in what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) motion (B) ocean (C) flintlock (D) arcade (E) tennis court", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. motion\nExplanation: In order for a projectile ball to hit a target, it needs to be in motion. Without motion, the ball will not be able to travel towards the target and make contact with it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Options B, C, D, and E are irrelevant to the question and do not contribute to the answer."}}
{"Q": "Where is a good place to set a cup of coffee while relaxing?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) coffee shop (B) kitchen (C) hand (D) table (E) office", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. table\nExplanation: A table is a more plausible answer as it provides a stable surface to set the cup of coffee on while relaxing. A coffee shop or office may have tables available, but a kitchen may not always have a suitable surface or may be too cluttered. Holding the cup in hand may not be comfortable for an extended period of time."}}
{"Q": "If a fried egg was runny and there was no toast to sop it up, after the meal there'd be a messy what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) henhouse (B) garden (C) plate (D) supermarket (E) bird's nest", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. plate\nExplanation: If there is no toast to soak up the runny yolk, it would likely remain on the plate and create a messy plate. The other options, such as a henhouse, garden, supermarket, or bird's nest, do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "If I want to behave with proper aplomb, what manners should I avoid?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) inappropriate (B) incomplete (C) impolite (D) none (E) incorrect", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. impolite\nExplanation: Aplomb refers to a sense of self-assurance and confidence in one's behavior. To behave with proper aplomb, one should avoid manners that are impolite, such as interrupting others, speaking rudely, or being disrespectful. Inappropriate, incomplete, and incorrect manners may also detract from one's sense of confidence, but they are not necessarily incompatible with proper aplomb if handled gracefully."}}
{"Q": "Before lifting weights he liked to warm up on the squash court, he really enjoyed the facilities of the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) swimming pool (B) rich person's house (C) country club (D) fitness center (E) park", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) fitness center\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the person likes to warm up on the squash court before lifting weights, which suggests that he is at a place where there is a gym or fitness center. The other options such as a swimming pool, rich person's house, country club, or park do not necessarily have a squash court or a gym. Therefore, option (D) fitness center is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What will happen to animals after eating food?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bite (B) digestion (C) feel pleasure (D) pass water (E) listen to each other", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. digestion\nExplanation: After animals eat food, it goes through a process called digestion where the food is broken down into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and used by the body for energy and growth. This process involves enzymes and other digestive juices in the stomach and intestines. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "If I wanted to grow plants, where could I put a lot of dirt?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) corner (B) street (C) closet (D) garden (E) bathtub", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. garden\nExplanation: A garden is a designated outdoor area for growing plants, typically with soil or dirt already present. It provides ample space and sunlight for plants to thrive and is a more practical option compared to a corner, street, closet, or bathtub."}}
{"Q": "What does a person often feel about someone judging them guilty?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) controversy (B) responsibility (C) resentment (D) judge feelings (E) hurt feelings", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Resentment.\n\nExplanation: When someone judges a person guilty, they often feel resentment towards the person who made the judgment. This is because being judged guilty can feel like an attack on one's character and can be seen as unfair or unjust. The person may feel angry or bitter towards the person who made the judgment, and may even hold a grudge against them. This is a common emotional response to being judged guilty, and can be difficult to overcome without addressing the underlying issues that led to the judgment in the first place."}}
{"Q": "A town between two mountains is located in a what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) valley (B) hospital (C) state (D) train station (E) michigan", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A valley.\nExplanation: A valley is a low area between two mountains or hills. It is a common geographical feature and is often used to describe the location of a town or city. Hospitals, states, train stations, and Michigan are not relevant to the location of a town between two mountains. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A) valley."}}
{"Q": "James need to use a toilet but there were no public ones in sight.  Eventually he broke down and did something very expensive so that he could get a toilet.  Where might he have gone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) motel room (B) apartment (C) bathroom (D) games (E) house", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. motel room\nExplanation: Motel rooms often have private bathrooms for guests, making them a plausible option for someone in need of a toilet. While apartments and houses may also have bathrooms, they are not typically accessible to the public. \"Games\" is not a relevant option, and \"bathroom\" is too general to be a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Why did the heavy metal band need electricity at the stadium?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) concert (B) bedroom (C) make person sick (D) building (E) church", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. concert\nExplanation: Heavy metal bands typically perform at concerts, which require electricity to power the instruments, amplifiers, and lighting equipment. Without electricity, the band would not be able to perform and the audience would not be able to hear or see the show. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the heavy metal band needed electricity for their concert at the stadium."}}
{"Q": "What is a person looking for when completing puzzles or riddles?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) avoid pain (B) compliments (C) intellectual challenge (D) passing grade (E) attention", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. intellectual challenge.\nExplanation: People who enjoy completing puzzles or riddles are often seeking a mental challenge and the satisfaction of solving a problem. They may enjoy the feeling of accomplishment that comes with figuring out a difficult puzzle or riddle. While some people may enjoy receiving compliments or attention for their puzzle-solving abilities, these are not typically the primary motivations for engaging in these activities. Similarly, avoiding pain or achieving a passing grade are not typically relevant factors when completing puzzles or riddles."}}
{"Q": "If someone was making breakfast, they'd probably put two slices of bread in the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) plastic bag (B) pantry (C) supermarket (D) toaster (E) prison", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Toaster.\nExplanation: Toaster is the most plausible answer as it is the appliance used to toast bread. Placing two slices of bread in a plastic bag or pantry would not make sense as they are not used for toasting. Similarly, a supermarket or prison would not be relevant in this context."}}
{"Q": "His house was a mess, he began doing housework to get what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) boredom (B) nice home (C) michigan (D) feeling satisfied (E) house clean", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (D) feeling satisfied. The sentence implies that the person's house was messy, which could have caused them to feel uncomfortable or dissatisfied with their living space. By doing housework, they would be able to clean and organize their home, which would likely lead to a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment. The other options, such as boredom, a nice home, or Michigan, do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Where would a corpse be covered by a blanket?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bath store (B) bedroom (C) hospital (D) flower garden (E) michigan", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. hospital\nExplanation: It is common practice in hospitals to cover a deceased person with a blanket as a sign of respect and to maintain their dignity. In a bath store or flower garden, it would be highly unlikely to find a corpse, and in a bedroom, it would depend on the circumstances of the death. Michigan is a state and not a location where a corpse would typically be covered by a blanket."}}
{"Q": "The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) accelerate (B) putting together (C) working (D) construct (E) train", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (A) accelerate because the person in the car is trying to kill the man, so it would make sense for them to speed up and try to catch him instead of doing something like putting together or constructing something. Working and training also do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The trucker plopped on the bench with a sense of relief, where did he arrive?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) bordello (B) rest area (C) garden (D) bus stop (E) state park", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. rest area\nExplanation: The phrase \"plopped on the bench with a sense of relief\" suggests that the trucker had been driving for a while and was in need of a break. A rest area is a common place for truckers to stop and take a break, making it the most plausible answer. A bordello, garden, bus stop, or state park would not typically have benches for resting, and may not be accessible or appropriate for a trucker to stop at."}}
{"Q": "What is part of a republic like the USA?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) state (B) democratic (C) kingdom (D) democracy (E) dictatorship", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. state\nExplanation: A republic like the USA is composed of individual states that have their own governments and laws, but are united under a federal government. This is a key feature of a federal republic, where power is shared between the central government and the individual states. The other options, such as democratic, kingdom, democracy, and dictatorship, do not accurately describe the structure of a republic like the USA."}}
{"Q": "Where do you keep extra clothing on a hike?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) person (B) hamper (C) closet (D) upstairs (E) backpack", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. backpack\nExplanation: When going on a hike, it is common to carry a backpack to store essential items such as water, snacks, and extra clothing. Carrying extra clothing in a backpack ensures that it is easily accessible and can be quickly changed if needed. Keeping extra clothing in a hamper, closet, or upstairs is not practical while on a hike, and carrying it on a person may be uncomfortable and restrict movement. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E. backpack."}}
{"Q": "What could an apple tree do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) new hampshire (B) bloom (C) washington state (D) sunshine (E) spontaneously combust", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Bloom.\nExplanation: An apple tree is a type of fruit tree that produces apples. One of the natural processes that an apple tree goes through is blooming, which is when it produces flowers that eventually turn into apples. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that an apple tree could bloom. The other options, such as New Hampshire, Washington State, sunshine, and spontaneous combustion, are not actions that an apple tree could perform."}}
{"Q": "What very cold area in the east can a crab be found?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) fish market (B) shallow waters (C) atlantic ocean (D) fresh water (E) shore line", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) Atlantic Ocean\nExplanation: Crabs can be found in the Atlantic Ocean, particularly in colder areas such as the northern Atlantic. They are often caught by fishermen and sold in fish markets, but they are not typically found in fish markets themselves. While crabs can be found in shallow waters and along shorelines, the question specifies a \"very cold area,\" which suggests a location farther out to sea. Freshwater environments are not typically suitable for crabs, as they require saltwater to survive. Therefore, the most plausible answer is the Atlantic Ocean."}}
{"Q": "The chef wanted to perfect his craft, what did he do?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) thin potatos (B) prepare food (C) study french cooking (D) drink (E) cook dinner", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. study french cooking\nExplanation: If the chef wanted to perfect his craft, it would make sense for him to study and learn from the techniques and traditions of French cooking, which is known for its precision and attention to detail. Thin potatoes, preparing food, and cooking dinner are all general tasks that a chef would already be doing, so they wouldn't necessarily lead to perfecting his craft. Drinking may actually hinder his ability to improve his skills."}}
{"Q": "She wanted a kitten and puppy so why did she only get the puppy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) one choice for pet (B) cute (C) kennel (D) soft (E) waxy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. one choice for pet.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the person wanted both a kitten and a puppy, but only got the puppy. This suggests that there was a limitation or restriction in place that allowed for only one choice of pet. Therefore, option A, \"one choice for pet,\" is the most plausible answer. The other options, such as \"cute,\" \"kennel,\" \"soft,\" and \"waxy,\" do not provide a logical explanation for why the person only got a puppy and not a kitten."}}
{"Q": "There was no shade for Jenny.  She was forced to lie there exposed to what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) full sunlight (B) bright sunshine (C) sunny place (D) eat cake (E) direct sunlight", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: \"Direct sunlight\" is a more accurate description of the situation as it implies that there was no obstruction between Jenny and the sun's rays. \"Full sunlight\" and \"bright sunshine\" are similar in meaning but do not convey the same level of intensity as \"direct sunlight.\" \"Sunny place\" is too vague and does not specifically address the lack of shade. \"Eat cake\" is not a relevant option."}}
{"Q": "What could happen to you after you are cleaning house for a long time?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) neatness (B) tiredness (C) order (D) exhaustion (E) sneezing", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. exhaustion\nExplanation: Cleaning house for a long time can be physically demanding and tiring, leading to exhaustion. This is especially true if the cleaning involves heavy lifting, scrubbing, or other strenuous activities. While neatness and order may be achieved as a result of cleaning, tiredness and exhaustion are more likely outcomes. Sneezing may also occur if there is a lot of dust or allergens present, but it is not as common as exhaustion."}}
{"Q": "What is someone doing when scheduling when to go to party?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) rumpspringa (B) meeting new people (C) having fun (D) meet new people (E) plan", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Plan.\nExplanation: When someone schedules when to go to a party, they are making a plan for when they will attend the event. This involves coordinating their schedule with the time and location of the party, as well as any other commitments they may have. While meeting new people and having fun may be goals of attending a party, scheduling specifically refers to the act of planning and organizing one's time. Rumpspringa is a term used in Amish culture to describe a period of adolescence when young people are allowed to experience the outside world before deciding whether to commit to the Amish way of life, so it is not relevant to party scheduling."}}
{"Q": "What kind of path do comets tend to have?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) ice (B) set orbits (C) universe (D) space (E) solid nucleus", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Set orbits.\n\nExplanation: Comets tend to have set orbits, meaning they follow a predictable path around the sun. These orbits can be highly elliptical, taking the comet far out into the solar system before swinging it back towards the sun. As the comet approaches the sun, the heat causes the ice on its surface to vaporize, creating the characteristic tail that we associate with comets. However, the solid nucleus of the comet remains intact and continues to follow its set orbit."}}

{"Q": "The vet found malignant tumors on the animals, what is their likely fate?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) euthanasia (B) pass water (C) die of cancer (D) feel pain (E) feel pleasure", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. die of cancer.\n\nExplanation: Malignant tumors are cancerous growths that can spread to other parts of the body and cause damage to organs and tissues. If left untreated, the cancer can progress and eventually lead to the animal's death. While euthanasia may be considered as a humane option in some cases, it is not the only outcome for animals with cancer. Passing water, feeling pain, or feeling pleasure are not relevant to the prognosis of cancer in animals."}}
{"Q": "What is the thing that is agitated in your head when kissing?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) sexual stimulation (B) herpes (C) headache (D) catch cold (E) happiness", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. happiness\nExplanation: When kissing, the brain releases a hormone called oxytocin, which is associated with feelings of happiness, bonding, and affection. This hormone can also reduce stress and anxiety, making kissing a pleasurable and enjoyable experience for many people. While sexual stimulation may also occur during kissing, it is not the only or primary thing that is agitated in the head. Herpes, headache, and catching a cold are all possible risks associated with kissing, but they are not the thing that is agitated in the head during the act."}}
{"Q": "Billy was reading the newspaper as he commuted to work, but once he got to his destination he balled it up and put it somewhere. Where did it put it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) trash (B) floor (C) subway (D) ground (E) lawn", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. trash\nExplanation: It is common for people to dispose of newspapers in the trash after reading them, especially if they are commuting and do not have a designated recycling bin nearby. It is unlikely that Billy would have thrown the newspaper on the floor, subway, ground, or lawn as this would be littering and disrespectful to the environment. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that he balled it up and threw it in the trash."}}
{"Q": "Where do you keep a pail in your house?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) garage (B) pool (C) utility room (D) hardware store (E) wishing well", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. utility room\nExplanation: A pail is typically used for carrying water or other liquids, and is often kept in a utility room where cleaning supplies and other household items are stored. It is unlikely to be kept in a garage or hardware store, and while it could be used for a pool, it would likely be stored in a utility room when not in use. A wishing well is not a practical location for storing a pail."}}

This can lead to them wanting to share their experience with others and talk about what happened. It is a natural human tendency to want to connect with others and share positive experiences. Killing each other, experiencing pain, or feeling hatred are unlikely responses to a positive outcome. Thanking God may be a response for some individuals, but it is not the only or most common response."}}

Japan\nExplanation: Kanji is a system of writing used in Japan, so it is likely that the terrace with Kanji written on it was made in Japan. The other options, such as rice paddy, garden, Michigan, and Italy, do not have a direct connection to Kanji or Japanese culture."}}
{"Q": "The company sent off many purchases, they used recycled cardboard as their what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) packaging materials (B) recycle bin (C) box factory (D) warehouse (E) bowler hats", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. packaging materials.\nExplanation: The use of recycled cardboard suggests that the company is environmentally conscious and likely to use it as packaging materials for their purchases. Option B, recycle bin, is not a plausible answer as it does not make sense for the company to use recycled cardboard as a recycle bin. Option C, box factory, is also not a plausible answer as the company is not producing cardboard boxes but using them. Option D, warehouse, is not a plausible answer as the use of recycled cardboard does not relate to the function of a warehouse. Option E, bowler hats, is clearly not a plausible answer as it is not related to the context of the sentence."}}

Eventually being rewarded for his patience reinforces this behavior and encourages him to continue exhibiting patience in the future."}}
{"Q": "The man was giving assistance to a pan handler in the streets, how did he give assistance?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) feeling good (B) killing (C) law suits (D) out of pocket (E) feel loved", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) out of pocket\nExplanation: The phrase \"out of pocket\" means to spend one's own money or resources. Therefore, the man gave assistance to the pan handler by providing financial support from his own pocket. This could include giving the pan handler money, buying them food or other necessities, or providing other forms of financial assistance. The other answer choices (feeling good, killing, law suits, feel loved) do not make sense in the context of giving assistance to a pan handler."}}

If the air is stuffy, turning on a fan can help circulate the air and make the living room more comfortable. The other options (hockey game, bathroom, football stadium, hot room) do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "While walking the student needed to store his writing insturment away, where did he put it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) desk drawer (B) cabinet (C) purse (D) classroom (E) pocket", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. pocket\nExplanation: Since the student is walking, it is more likely that they would store their writing instrument in their pocket for easy access rather than in a desk drawer, cabinet, or purse which are stationary objects. The classroom is also not a plausible option as it is not a specific location within the classroom."}}
{"Q": "Who watches a play in an auditorium?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) building (B) crowd (C) city (D) group (E) high school", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. group\nExplanation: An auditorium is a venue designed for large gatherings, typically for performances such as plays, concerts, and lectures.

{"Q": "There was many a bottle to choose from behind the cashier where?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) grocery store (B) diaper bag (C) gas station (D) liquor store (E) medicine cabinet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. liquor store.\nExplanation: The phrase \"many a bottle\" implies a large selection of bottles, which is more likely to be found in a liquor store than in a grocery store, gas station, diaper bag, or medicine cabinet. Additionally, the fact that the bottles are behind the cashier suggests that they are being sold, further supporting the idea that this is a liquor store."}}
{"Q": "They had to know where to go, they got on the national highway after consulting the what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) canada (B) atlas (C) united states (D) major cities (E) book", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (B) atlas, as an atlas is a book of maps that would provide directions and information on major highways and roads. It is common for people to consult an atlas or map when planning a route for a road trip or journey. Canada and the United States are countries, and major cities are not specific enough to provide directions on which highway to take. \"Book\" is too general and does not specify what type of book would provide directions."}}
{"Q": "What do professors primarily do?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) master physics (B) state facts (C) wear wrinkled tweed jackets (D) school students (E) teach courses", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E.

Phlegm is a thick, sticky substance produced by the respiratory system in response to inflammation or infection. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including allergies, infections, and smoking. If you are spitting a lot without noticing, it may be a sign that you have an excess of phlegm in your system.

This curiosity is a natural part of human development and exploration of one's own sexuality. It is important for young people to have access to accurate information and resources to make informed decisions about their sexual health and well-being."}}
{"Q": "Sally was standing in queue.  The line was very, very slow.  What was she feeling?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) frustration (B) delays (C) being annoyed (D) moving forward (E) progress", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. frustration\nExplanation: Sally was standing in a slow-moving queue, which can be a frustrating experience. She may have been feeling annoyed or experiencing delays, but frustration is the most plausible answer as it is a common emotion associated with waiting in long lines.

{"Q": "James and Holly went dancing together. As they danced, he  pressed himself against her what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) euphoria (B) moving body (C) rhythmic movement (D) happiness (E) fatigue", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. rhythmic movement.\nExplanation: The phrase \"pressed himself against her\" suggests that James was dancing closely with Holly, and the use of the word \"rhythmic\" implies that they were moving in sync with the music. Option A (euphoria) and option D (happiness) suggest emotional states rather than physical sensations, while option B (moving body) and option E (fatigue) do not accurately describe the specific physical sensation that would result from dancing closely with someone. Therefore, option C (rhythmic movement) is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "If a house has a subscription, what likely shows up in the driveway every morning?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) subdivision (B) newspaper (C) street (D) laundry mat (E) surface of earth", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. newspaper.\n\nExplanation: If a house has a subscription, it is likely that a newspaper delivery person will show up in the driveway every morning to deliver the newspaper.

This could involve taking a shower, washing their hands, or simply cleaning the area that feels dirty. Feeling lucky or wondering what happened would not address the feeling of being dirty, while crossing the street or eating would be unrelated actions."}}
{"Q": "After the weight cut he was worried about his energy levels, but this was part of participating in a what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) work (B) wrestle (C) play sports (D) matter (E) sleep", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. wrestle\nExplanation: The mention of a weight cut suggests that the person is a wrestler who had to lose weight to compete in a certain weight class. Wrestlers often have to cut weight before a match, which can affect their energy levels. Therefore, it is likely that the person was worried about his energy levels before participating in a wrestling match."}}

Skipping meals or not eating enough can lead to malnutrition and other health problems."}}
{"Q": "Who is the guard here for?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) man post (B) attack (C) intimidation (D) prisoner (E) unprotected", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. prisoner\nExplanation: The presence of a guard usually indicates that there is someone or something that needs to be protected or monitored. In this case, the most plausible answer is that the guard is for a prisoner. The guard is likely there to prevent the prisoner from escaping or causing harm to themselves or others. The other options, such as man post, attack, intimidation, and unprotected, do not provide a clear reason for why a guard would be necessary."}}
{"Q": "If a person stutters when he experiences anxiety or excitement, he'll have difficult doing what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) express information (B) dance (C) library (D) go somewhere (E) study", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Stuttering is a speech disorder that affects a person's ability to speak fluently. When a person experiences anxiety or excitement, their stuttering may become more pronounced, making it difficult for them to express information clearly and effectively. Dancing, going to the library, going somewhere, or studying do not necessarily require fluent speech, so they are less likely to be affected by stuttering."}}
{"Q": "Where can you keep letter opener when it likely to be needed soon?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) office supply store (B) stationery store (C) dek (D) martyr's chest (E) refrigerator", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Desk.\nExplanation: Keeping a letter opener in a desk is a practical and common solution as it is easily accessible when needed. It is also a logical place to store office supplies and stationery. The other options, such as an office supply store or stationery store, would require leaving the immediate area and purchasing a new letter opener. The martyr's chest and refrigerator options are not practical or logical places to store a letter opener."}}
{"Q": "Danny found that the carpet did not ,match the drapes, which was disappointing, because this place was expensive.  But it was the only place in town that wasn't booked solid for the week and he needed it while he was in town, so he couldn't complain.   Where might this place be?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) brothel (B) restaurant (C) building (D) bowling alley (E) at hotel", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. at hotel\nExplanation: The fact that the place was expensive and the only one available in town suggests that it is a hotel. The phrase \"booked solid\" also implies that it is a place where people stay overnight, further supporting the idea that it is a hotel. The mention of the carpet and drapes not matching is likely a detail about the room's decor, which is common in hotels. The other options, such as a brothel or bowling alley, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "What do people need to do to change their lives?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) face problems (B) better themselves (C) pay bills (D) become disillusioned (E) eat chicken", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. better themselves.\nExplanation: In order to change their lives, people need to focus on improving themselves. This can involve setting goals, learning new skills, developing positive habits, and making healthy choices. While facing problems and paying bills are important aspects of life, they are not necessarily the key to making significant changes. Becoming disillusioned may lead to a desire for change, but it is not a proactive approach. Eating chicken, while delicious, is not relevant to changing one's life. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Humans need shelter to survive.  They usually find shelter where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) underpass (B) homes (C) workplace (D) school (E) space shuttle", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Homes.\nExplanation: Homes are the most common and practical shelter for humans. They provide protection from the elements, privacy, and a sense of security.

First class is a higher level of service and comfort than economy class, so it could be seen as a way to compensate for a bad flight. The other options (propitious, reputable, one, sufficient) do not make sense in this context."}}

From the intricate patterns of a snowflake to the grandeur of a mountain range, nature's beauty is awe-inspiring. In contrast, artificial structures are often limited by the materials and technology available to humans, and while they can be impressive, they rarely match the complexity and beauty of natural structures."}}
{"Q": "The water in clouds turn in to what when it gets cold?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) typhoon (B) snowflake (C) laddle (D) teardrops (E) sink", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. snowflake\nExplanation: When the water in clouds gets cold, it freezes and forms ice crystals. These ice crystals then stick together and form snowflakes. Therefore, option B, snowflake, is the most plausible answer. Options A, C, D, and E are not related to the process of water turning into snow in clouds."}}
{"Q": "What southern U.S. state is know for having many swamps?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) wetlands (B) new york (C) michigan (D) louisiana (E) river delta", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D) Louisiana\nExplanation: Louisiana is known for having many swamps due to its location in the southern United States and its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico. The state's wetlands and river delta provide a unique ecosystem that is home to a variety of plant and animal species. Additionally, Louisiana's humid subtropical climate and high levels of precipitation contribute to the formation and maintenance of its swamps."}}
{"Q": "When going to sleep what happens to your body?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) snoring (B) latency (C) dreams (D) relaxation (E) dreaming", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Relaxation.\n\nExplanation: When going to sleep, the body goes through a process of relaxation. The muscles in the body become less tense, the heart rate slows down, and breathing becomes more regular. This relaxation allows the body to enter a state of rest and repair, which is essential for overall health and well-being. While dreaming may occur during sleep, it is not a universal experience and not everyone remembers their dreams. Snoring may occur in some individuals, but it is not a necessary or defining characteristic of sleep. Latency refers to the time it takes to fall asleep, which can vary from person to person. Therefore, relaxation is the most plausible answer as it is a universal and necessary aspect of the sleep process."}}
{"Q": "Where is a monkey likely to enjoy being?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) banana tree (B) sailor suit (C) theatre (D) mulberry bush (E) research laboratory", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Banana tree.\n\nExplanation: Monkeys are known to love bananas, so it is likely that they would enjoy being in a place where they can easily access and eat bananas, such as a banana tree. The other options, such as a sailor suit, theatre, mulberry bush, or research laboratory, do not provide any clear benefit or enjoyment for a monkey."}}
{"Q": "What is a form of anaerobic exercising?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) shortness of breath (B) lift weights (C) error (D) fall down (E) run", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Lift weights.\nExplanation: Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that involves short bursts of intense activity, such as weightlifting or sprinting. It does not rely on oxygen for energy and can help build muscle and improve overall fitness. Shortness of breath and falling down are not forms of exercise, and \"error\" is not a relevant option. Running can be either aerobic or anaerobic depending on the intensity and duration of the activity."}}
{"Q": "The earth is one planet in what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) tree (B) orbit (C) solar system (D) fotograph (E) dreams", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. solar system.\nExplanation: The earth is one planet in our solar system, which consists of eight planets, including Earth, and their respective moons, as well as other celestial bodies such as asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets. The solar system is located in the Milky Way galaxy and is just one small part of the vast universe."}}
{"Q": "Where would you put a container can after you buy it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) pantry (B) store (C) gas (D) liquid (E) garage", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Pantry\nExplanation: A container can is typically used to store dry goods such as beans, pasta, or cereal. Therefore, it would be most appropriate to store it in a pantry or other dry storage area in the kitchen. Storing it in a store, gas station, or garage would not make sense as these are not appropriate storage locations for food items. Liquid is not a relevant option as the question specifically mentions a container can, which is not typically used for liquids."}}
{"Q": "Where did you meet your best friend since Kindergarten?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) friend's house (B) school (C) fraternity house (D) internet cafe (E) airplane", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. school\nExplanation: It is more likely that someone would meet their best friend since Kindergarten at school, as they would have been in the same class or classes together for several years. Meeting at a friend's house or fraternity house may be possible, but less likely as they would have had to have mutual friends or interests. Meeting on an airplane or at an internet cafe is even less likely, as these are more transient locations where people are less likely to form long-lasting friendships."}}
{"Q": "James was below the balloon.  He watched it rise.  What direction did he look in?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) upstairs (B) aloft (C) diagonal (D) upstream (E) upwards", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. upwards\nExplanation: Since James was below the balloon and watched it rise, he must have looked in the direction of the balloon's ascent, which is upwards. Therefore, option E, upwards, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John and Tim like playing. It makes them what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) feeling happy (B) learning (C) injury (D) burn (E) get hungry", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. feeling happy.\n\nExplanation: Playing is often associated with enjoyment and pleasure, which can lead to feelings of happiness. John and Tim likely enjoy playing and find it to be a source of happiness for them. The other options, such as learning, injury, burning, or getting hungry, are not necessarily related to playing and do not make as much sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "What could happen if someone is seeing new presents at a birthday party?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) envy (B) jealousy (C) education (D) fear (E) excitement", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. excitement\nExplanation: Seeing new presents at a birthday party is likely to evoke excitement as it is a common reaction to receiving gifts and seeing others receive them. Envy and jealousy may occur if someone is comparing their own gifts to others, but it is not the most plausible answer in this scenario. Education and fear are not relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Joe's cat smelled something delicious and jumped into this, causing him to panic and fear for its life. Where might it have jumped?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) meat loaf (B) bedroom (C) microwave (D) living room (E) floor", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. meat loaf\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cat jumped into a meat loaf, as cats are known to be attracted to the smell of meat. Jumping into a bedroom, living room, or on the floor would not necessarily cause panic and fear for the cat's life. Jumping into a microwave would be dangerous, but it is unlikely that the cat would be able to open the microwave and climb inside."}}
{"Q": "Why would a person put flowers in a room with dirty gym socks?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) continue to grow (B) plant themselves (C) many colors (D) smell good (E) make pretty", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Smell good.\nExplanation: A person would put flowers in a room with dirty gym socks to help mask the unpleasant odor of the socks. Flowers are known for their pleasant fragrance and can help freshen up a room."}}
{"Q": "The table wasn't level.  some parts were higher and some were lower with no rhyme or reason.   It was very what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) electrical circuit (B) build evenly (C) uneven (D) unbalanced (E) tilted", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. uneven\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the table had parts that were higher and some that were lower with no pattern or logic. This indicates that the table was not level and had an uneven surface. Therefore, option C, \"uneven,\" is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The person signed up for home insurance, what is he seeking?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) financial security (B) live well (C) good relationship (D) compliments (E) discounted furniture", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. financial security.\n\nExplanation: By signing up for home insurance, the person is seeking financial security in case of any unexpected events or damages to their home. Home insurance provides coverage for various risks such as fire, theft, natural disasters, and liability. It helps the person to protect their investment and avoid financial losses that could arise from repairing or rebuilding their home. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "James know that committing murder was wrong, but he thought that he could get away with it.  He was really troubled  and fearful because of what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) happiness (B) problems (C) prosecution (D) distress (E) misery", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. prosecution.\nExplanation: James' fear and trouble stem from the possibility of being caught and facing legal consequences for his actions. He may have thought he could get away with murder, but the fear of prosecution and punishment would still weigh heavily on him. The other choices, such as happiness, problems, distress, and misery, do not accurately reflect the specific source of James' fear and trouble in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "How can someone die from eating hamburger?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) gas (B) getting full (C) mad cow disease (D) death (E) feel full", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Mad cow disease.\nExplanation: Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a fatal neurological disease that can be contracted by consuming contaminated beef products, such as hamburgers. The disease causes abnormal proteins to build up in the brain, leading to neurological symptoms and ultimately death. While getting full or feeling full from eating a hamburger is possible, it is not a cause of death. Gas may cause discomfort but is not fatal, and simply stating \"death\" is not a specific cause."}}
{"Q": "Where would using a boat not require navigation skills?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) water (B) ocean (C) garage (D) harbor (E) river", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Using a boat in a garage would not require navigation skills as it is an enclosed space with no open water or currents to navigate. The other options all involve bodies of water that would require some level of navigation skills to safely operate a boat."}}
{"Q": "What does a self assured person often do?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) acknowledgment (B) focused (C) know what time (D) feel important (E) trust himself", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. trust himself\nExplanation: A self-assured person is confident in their abilities and decisions, which means they trust themselves. They are not easily swayed by others' opinions and are comfortable making choices based on their own judgment. This trait often leads to success and a sense of inner peace."}}
{"Q": "He was very outgoing, for him making friends was no personal what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) scary (B) having friends (C) good feeling (D) conflict (E) friendship", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) scary.\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person being described is very outgoing and finds it easy to make friends. Therefore, the answer cannot be (B) having friends or (E) friendship, as these options are already implied in the sentence. The answer cannot be (C) good feeling either, as this option does not make sense in the context of the sentence. The answer cannot be (D) conflict either, as there is no indication of conflict in the sentence. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (A) scary, as it suggests that the person being described does not find making friends to be a personal challenge or source of anxiety."}}
{"Q": "What do you feel when giving assistance to the needy?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) reward (B) boredom (C) pleasure (D) happiness (E) satisfaction", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. satisfaction\nExplanation: Helping those in need can give a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction knowing that you have made a positive impact on someone's life. It may not always be easy or convenient, but the feeling of making a difference can be very rewarding. Boredom and happiness may not be the most appropriate responses, while reward and pleasure may imply a selfish motive rather than a selfless act of kindness."}}
{"Q": "Paul wants carrots and doesn't need to drive anywhere. He gets them from where?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) refrigerator (B) store (C) farmer's market (D) supermarket (E) dryer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. refrigerator\nExplanation: If Paul doesn't need to drive anywhere, it's likely that he already has carrots at home. The most common place to store carrots at home would be in the refrigerator. Therefore, it's plausible that Paul would get his carrots from the refrigerator. The other options (store, farmer's market, supermarket) would require him to leave his home and drive somewhere, which is not necessary according to the question. The option \"dryer\" is not a plausible answer as it is not a place where one would typically find carrots."}}
{"Q": "He was a sloppy eater, so where did he leave a mess?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) sailboat (B) desk (C) closet (D) table (E) apartment", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. table\nExplanation: Since the question mentions that he was a sloppy eater, it is most likely that he left a mess on a surface where he would eat, such as a table. The other options, such as a sailboat, closet, or apartment, do not seem as likely to be places where someone would eat and leave a mess. A desk could be a possibility, but a table is a more common surface for eating."}}
{"Q": "What does every person want?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) life partner (B) larger house (C) second chances (D) money (E) headache", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) life partner\nExplanation: While everyone's desires and priorities may differ, having a life partner is a common desire for many people. Humans are social creatures and crave companionship, love, and support. A life partner can provide emotional and physical support, share experiences and memories, and offer a sense of security and stability. While other options like a larger house, second chances, or money may be desirable, they may not be as universally sought after as a life partner."}}
{"Q": "If a small flying animal picks up a string, where are they taking it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bird's nest (B) park (C) guitar (D) kite (E) quark", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. bird's nest\nExplanation: It is common for birds to use strings, twigs, and other materials to build their nests. Therefore, it is more plausible that a small flying animal, such as a bird, would be taking the string to its nest rather than to a park, guitar, kite, or quark (which is a subatomic particle)."}}
{"Q": "He had no issue committing perjury, he had a what that he would get away with it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) confidence (B) go to jail (C) telling lies (D) lying (E) manual", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) confidence\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person had no problem lying under oath, which is a serious offense. The word \"issue\" implies that there was no hesitation or reluctance on his part. Therefore, it is likely that he had confidence in his ability to deceive others and avoid getting caught. The other options, such as \"go to jail\" or \"manual,\" do not fit the context and are not logical choices."}}
{"Q": "What could go to a tennis court?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) desert (B) college campus (C) recreational center (D) athletic club (E) park", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. park\nExplanation: A tennis court is typically found in a park or a recreational center where people can play tennis for leisure or exercise. While it is possible for a tennis court to be located on a college campus or an athletic club, these locations are not as common as parks or recreational centers. A desert would not be a suitable location for a tennis court due to the lack of infrastructure and resources needed to maintain it."}}
{"Q": "What could you use to fill a cup and then drink from it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) sand box (B) kitchen cabinet (C) waterfall (D) water fountain (E) table", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Water fountain.\nExplanation: A water fountain is a source of clean drinking water that is designed for public use. It typically has a spout or nozzle that dispenses water into a cup or bottle. Sand box, kitchen cabinet, waterfall, and table are not suitable for filling a cup and drinking from it."}}
{"Q": "The two played video games all night in the living room, he enjoyed visiting where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) formal seating (B) friend's house (C) movies (D) home (E) apartment", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. home.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the two played video games all night in the living room, which implies that they were in someone's home. The other options, such as formal seating, friend's house, movies, or apartment, do not fit the context of the sentence as well as \"home\" does."}}
{"Q": "The weasel ran up away from danger, somebody joked only our first president could get him down from the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) washington dc (B) ladder (C) natural history museum (D) cherry tree (E) chicken coop", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. cherry tree\nExplanation: The joke is referencing the famous story of George Washington chopping down a cherry tree and then admitting to it by saying \"I cannot tell a lie.\" Therefore, the weasel is stuck up in a cherry tree and only George Washington could get him down. The other options (A) Washington DC, (B) ladder, (C) natural history museum, and (E) chicken coop do not fit with the context of the joke."}}
{"Q": "If you were looking for a blowfish, you wouldn't look on dry land, you'd look in a what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) fish market (B) jungle (C) sea water (D) body of water (E) soup", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) body of water\nExplanation: Blowfish are aquatic animals and cannot survive on dry land. Therefore, it is more plausible to look for them in a body of water such as the ocean, a lake, or a river."}}
{"Q": "George checked the rotor of the Apache, which wasn't powered by internal combustion, but by what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) jet engine (B) helicopter (C) electric motor (D) rotator (E) electrical circuit", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. electric motor.\n\nExplanation: The rotor of the Apache helicopter is powered by an electric motor, which is connected to the main transmission system. This motor provides the necessary power to rotate the rotor blades and lift the helicopter off the ground. The Apache does not use a jet engine or a rotator to power its rotor, and while it is a type of helicopter, that is not the answer to the question. An electrical circuit is also not a plausible answer as it is not a source of power."}}
{"Q": "The poker dealer spread the flop of cards across the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) players (B) play games (C) casino (D) table (E) toy store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. table.\nExplanation: In poker, the dealer spreads the flop of cards face up on the table, which is where the players can see them and use them to make their hands. Therefore, option D, table, is the most plausible answer. Options A, B, C, and E are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Where is a salt shaker most often kept?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) cruet (B) table setting (C) kitchen cupboard (D) cabinet (E) store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Table setting.\n\nExplanation: A salt shaker is most often kept on the table setting, usually next to the pepper shaker. It is easily accessible during meals and allows people to add salt to their food as desired. While a salt shaker may also be kept in a kitchen cupboard or cabinet when not in use, it is typically brought out and placed on the table during meal times. A cruet is a container for oil and vinegar, not salt, and a store is not a location where a salt shaker is typically kept."}}
{"Q": "Where would you put a dollar if you want to go to a store and buy something with it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cash drawer (B) teh bank (C) safety deposit box (D) pocket (E) piggy bank", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cash drawer\nExplanation: If you want to go to a store and buy something with a dollar, the most plausible option would be to keep it in your pocket or wallet and use it to pay at the store. The cash drawer is where the store keeps its cash, so it wouldn't make sense to put your dollar there. The bank and safety deposit box are places where you can store money for safekeeping, but they are not necessary for a single dollar. A piggy bank is a good option for saving money, but it is not practical for spending at a store. Therefore, the most plausible answer is to keep the dollar in your pocket or wallet and use it to pay at the store."}}
{"Q": "What room is likely to have a sideboard on the counter?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) home (B) serve food buffet (C) dining room (D) living room (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. dining room.\n\nExplanation: A sideboard is a piece of furniture typically used for storing dishes, linens, and other dining room essentials. It is often placed in the dining room to provide additional storage and serving space during meals. While it is possible to have a sideboard in other rooms, such as the living room or kitchen, it is most commonly found in the dining room.

Additionally, the speed at which an airplane travels would make it difficult for bugs to catch up and collide with the windshield."}}
{"Q": "What mall store sells jeans for a decent price?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) clothing store (B) bedroom (C) thrift store (D) apartment (E) gap", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Gap\nExplanation: Gap is a popular mall store that sells jeans for a decent price. They often have sales and promotions, making their jeans even more affordable. Additionally, Gap offers a variety of styles and sizes, making it easy to find a pair of jeans that fits well and looks great."}}
{"Q": "Where can a bath towel be borrowed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) cupboard (B) at hotel (C) swimming pool (D) clothes line (E) backpack", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. at hotel\nExplanation: Bath towels are commonly provided for guests at hotels, making it a plausible option for borrowing a towel. Cupboards and clothes lines are unlikely places to borrow a towel, while swimming pools and backpacks may not always have towels available for borrowing."}}
{"Q": "Why do people stop caring about their problems?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) no problems (B) better themselves (C) face problems (D) learn from each other (E) become disillusioned", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (E) become disillusioned\nExplanation: Sometimes people may become disillusioned with their problems, feeling like they have tried everything and nothing seems to work. This can lead to a sense of hopelessness and apathy towards their problems. They may also feel like their problems are insignificant compared to larger issues in the world, causing them to shift their focus away from their own problems."}}
{"Q": "John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther. What might he have bee on?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) mountain (B) fancy (C) sandplain (D) cliff (E) gorge", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. sandplain\nExplanation: A sandplain is a flat, sandy area that is often found near the coast. It is possible that John was riding on a vehicle or animal on the sandplain until he reached the ocean and could not continue any further. The other options, such as a mountain, fancy, cliff, or gorge, do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "They were never going to be big actors, but they all had passion for the local what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) theater (B) opera (C) show (D) television (E) blockbuster feature", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. theater\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the individuals being referred to had a passion for something related to acting, but it also implies that they were not going to achieve fame or success in the field. Local theater is a more plausible option than opera, show, television, or blockbuster feature, as it is a common outlet for amateur actors to pursue their passion."}}
{"Q": "Where would you use a folding chair but not store one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) beach (B) city hall (C) closet (D) garage (E) school", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. beach\nExplanation: Folding chairs are commonly used at the beach for sitting and relaxing.

Calluses.\nExplanation: When you spend a long time shopping in uncomfortable shoes, the constant pressure and friction on your feet can cause the development of calluses. Calluses are thickened areas of skin that form in response to repeated rubbing or pressure. They can be painful and unsightly, and may require treatment to prevent infection or further damage to the skin. Therefore, it is important to wear comfortable shoes while shopping to avoid developing calluses."}}
{"Q": "What does impeachment mean for the president?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) vote (B) election (C) trouble (D) board room (E) corporation", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) trouble.\nExplanation: Impeachment is a process by which a legislative body, such as the US Congress, investigates and potentially removes a high-ranking official from office. In the case of a president, impeachment can lead to a trial in the Senate and, if convicted, removal from office. Therefore, impeachment can be a significant source of trouble for a president, potentially leading to a tarnished legacy and loss of power."}}
{"Q": "Noble citizen of the Roman empire believed those born with lower status were what to them?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) loser (B) ignoble (C) peasant (D) inferior (E) plebeian", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. inferior\nExplanation: The Roman society was highly stratified, with a clear distinction between the upper and lower classes. The noble citizens, who belonged to the upper class, believed that those born with lower status were inferior to them. This belief was based on the idea of hierarchy, where the higher classes were considered superior to the lower classes. The term \"inferior\" accurately reflects this belief and is a more plausible answer than the other options."}}
{"Q": "Spraining an ankle while playing baseball will cause what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) strikes (B) eating (C) injury (D) sore muscles (E) pain", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. injury\nExplanation: Spraining an ankle while playing baseball is a type of injury that can occur due to sudden twisting or turning of the ankle. It can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty in walking or standing. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer. Option A (strikes) is not related to ankle sprain, option B (eating) is irrelevant, option D (sore muscles) may occur after exercise but not necessarily after an ankle sprain, and option E (pain) is a symptom of ankle sprain."}}
{"Q": "John was traveling to a new city and took time to check out a business.  He noticed that its carpet was stained with sauces and ketchup. What type of business might that be?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) bedroom (B) chair (C) bowling alley (D) at hotel (E) restaurant", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. restaurant\nExplanation: The fact that the carpet was stained with sauces and ketchup suggests that the business serves food, and specifically, messy foods that are likely to drip or spill onto the floor. A bedroom or chair would not typically have food stains on the carpet, and a bowling alley or hotel may have carpet stains from foot traffic or luggage, but not necessarily from food. Therefore, a restaurant is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "If you have a condo in a Wisconsin city known for beer, where are you?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) city (B) electrical circuit (C) residential area (D) suburbia (E) milwaukee", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. city\nExplanation: Wisconsin is known for its beer culture, with Milwaukee being a major hub for breweries. Other cities in Wisconsin, such as Madison and Green Bay, also have a strong beer scene. Therefore, if you have a condo in a Wisconsin city known for beer, it is most likely located in a city with a thriving brewery culture."}}
{"Q": "Where is hard to read note likely to be?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) fridge (B) sheet music (C) desk (D) bed (E) medical chart", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. medical chart\nExplanation: A hard to read note is likely to be found on a medical chart as it contains important information about a patient's health and treatment plan. The note may be written quickly or by someone with poor handwriting, making it difficult to read and understand. It is important for medical professionals to be able to read and interpret these notes accurately to provide the best possible care for the patient."}}
{"Q": "How does someone go about buying beer?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) have no money (B) pants (C) relaxation (D) lose money (E) spend money", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Spend money.\nExplanation: In most cases, buying beer requires spending money. The amount of money needed will depend on the type and quantity of beer being purchased.

{"Q": "If there is gum on your shoe where did it likely come from?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) shelf (B) movies (C) sidewalk (D) water fountain (E) table", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. sidewalk\nExplanation: Gum is commonly found on sidewalks as people often discard it on the ground after chewing it. It is less likely to be found on a shelf, at the movies, or on a table. It is also unlikely to be found near a water fountain as people do not typically chew gum while drinking water."}}
{"Q": "If a person isn't able to pay their bills what must they do?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) know everything (B) acknowledgment (C) make more money (D) throw a party (E) spare time", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. make more money.\nExplanation: If a person is unable to pay their bills, they need to find a way to increase their income. This could involve getting a second job, freelancing, or starting a side business. It's important to acknowledge the situation and take action to improve it, rather than ignoring the problem or wasting time on non-essential activities like throwing a party or having spare time. Knowing everything may be helpful in some situations, but it won't necessarily solve the problem of not being able to pay bills."}}
{"Q": "What is main benefit to exercising?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) losing weight (B) healthy (C) get in shape (D) weight loss (E) sweat", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Healthy.\nExplanation: Exercising has numerous benefits, but the main one is improving overall health. Regular exercise can reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It can also improve mental health, boost energy levels, and promote better sleep. While weight loss and getting in shape are common goals of exercise, they are not the only benefits. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Steve thought that it was possible, but he agreed that it was what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) no go (B) unable (C) unlikely (D) impossibility (E) cant do", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. unlikely\nExplanation: The phrase \"Steve thought that it was possible\" suggests that Steve had some hope or belief that something could be done. However, his agreement that it was \"unlikely\" indicates that he recognizes the difficulty or unlikelihood of the situation. The other options (A) no go, (B) unable, and (E) can't do all suggest a complete inability to accomplish something, which does not fit with the idea that Steve thought it was possible. Option (D) impossibility is too extreme and does not allow for any possibility of success. Therefore, (C) unlikely is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What region of a west coast U.S. city would you find a Japanese restaurant?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) california (B) tokio (C) downtown (D) narnia (E) large town", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. downtown\n\nExplanation: Japanese restaurants are commonly found in urban areas, particularly in downtown areas where there is a high concentration of businesses and foot traffic. While California and large towns may also have Japanese restaurants, they are not specific enough to pinpoint a location within a city. Tokyo is not a region of a west coast U.S. city, and Narnia is a fictional location. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C. downtown."}}
{"Q": "What is a tactic used to interfere with learning about science?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) repetition (B) sense of wonder (C) accidents (D) intimidation (E) increased knowledge", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Intimidation.\nExplanation: Intimidation is a tactic used to interfere with learning about science. When students feel intimidated, they may be less likely to ask questions or participate in class discussions, which can hinder their ability to learn and understand scientific concepts. Intimidation can come from teachers, peers, or even the subject matter itself, and it can be a significant barrier to effective science education."}}
{"Q": "What do people usually feel when falling in love?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) getting married (B) pain (C) happiness (D) getting married (E) suffering", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. happiness.\n\nExplanation: Falling in love is often associated with feelings of joy, excitement, and happiness. People may experience a rush of positive emotions, such as butterflies in their stomach, increased energy, and a sense of euphoria. While love can also bring challenges and difficulties, the initial stages of falling in love are typically characterized by positive feelings."}}
{"Q": "The tiger was stuck in what animal prison where he got lazy and fat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) jungle (B) zoo (C) kill (D) india (E) eat cake", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. zoo\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B, zoo, as it is a place where animals are kept in captivity for public display. Tigers in zoos often have limited space to roam and hunt, which can lead to boredom and a sedentary lifestyle. This can cause them to become lazy and overweight, as they are not getting enough exercise and stimulation. Therefore, it is likely that the tiger in question was stuck in a zoo where he became lazy and fat."}}
{"Q": "What do parents tell a child to do on the weekend?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) study (B) begin school (C) go out to play (D) row boat (E) clean room", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. go out to play.\nExplanation: Parents often encourage their children to engage in physical activity and social interaction on the weekends. Going out to play can help children develop important social skills, improve their physical health, and reduce stress. While studying and cleaning the room are important tasks, weekends are also a time for relaxation and fun. Beginning school and row boating may not be feasible or appropriate activities for every child on every weekend."}}
{"Q": "Why are dogs often known as man's best friend?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) aggressive (B) friendly (C) very loyal (D) found outside (E) very smart", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. very loyal\nExplanation: Dogs are known for their loyalty towards their owners. They are always there for their owners, providing companionship, protection, and comfort. They are willing to do anything to please their owners and are always happy to see them. This loyalty is what makes them such great companions and earns them the title of \"man's best friend.\""}}
{"Q": "Where can you buy a two wheel transportation machine?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) boat (B) michigan (C) train station (D) bicycle shop (E) trunk of car", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Bicycle shop.\nExplanation: A bicycle shop is the most plausible answer as it is a place where you can buy a two-wheel transportation machine, which is a bicycle. Boats, Michigan, train stations, and the trunk of a car are not relevant options for purchasing a bicycle."}}
{"Q": "Where might an alien use a vacuum?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) space (B) closet (C) kitchen (D) orbit (E) container", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. space\nExplanation: An alien would most likely use a vacuum in space to clean up debris or dust particles that may interfere with their spacecraft or equipment. In the vacuum of space, there is no air resistance, so a vacuum would be an effective tool for cleaning up any unwanted materials. Using a vacuum in a closet, kitchen, or container would not be necessary for an alien as they may have different methods of cleaning or may not even have a need for cleaning in the same way humans do. Using a vacuum in orbit may be possible, but it would be more practical to use it in space where there is no gravitational pull."}}
{"Q": "Where do you buy condoms?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) supermarket (B) sock drawer (C) cd store (D) medicine chest (E) bedroom", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Supermarket\nExplanation: Condoms are commonly sold in supermarkets, drugstores, and convenience stores. These places are easily accessible and provide a variety of options for customers to choose from. It is important to practice safe sex and using condoms is one way to prevent sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies. Therefore, it is recommended to purchase condoms from a reliable source like a supermarket."}}
{"Q": "What animal is known for being a follower?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) goat (B) expensive (C) lion (D) wolf (E) meadow", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) wolf\nExplanation: Wolves are known for their pack mentality and strong social bonds. They often follow the lead of their alpha or dominant members and work together to hunt and protect their territory. While goats, lions, and meadows may have their own unique characteristics, they are not typically associated with being followers in the same way that wolves are. \"Expensive\" is not an animal and therefore not a valid choice."}}
{"Q": "The soldier was told to get to the rendezvous point, for there he was suppose to what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) fight enemy (B) go to war (C) fight for freedom (D) wait for orders (E) follow instructions", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. fight enemy.\nExplanation: The soldier was given a specific location to meet up with others, which is known as a rendezvous point. The purpose of this meeting was likely to coordinate efforts and prepare for a specific mission or battle. Therefore, it is plausible that the soldier was instructed to fight the enemy at the rendezvous point."}}
{"Q": "If you want to kill someone you can do what to them with a gun?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sip through (B) damnation (C) shoot (D) commit crime (E) eat breakfast", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. shoot.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is C, shoot, as it is the action that is commonly associated with using a gun to harm or kill someone. The other options, such as sipping through or eating breakfast, are not relevant to the question and do not make sense in this context. Option B, damnation, is also not a practical answer as it refers to a religious concept of punishment and not a physical action. Option D, commit crime, is too broad and does not specify the method of harm. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C, shoot."}}
{"Q": "The hostess greeted the employees to the program, she then led them to their what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) group people (B) welcome guests (C) occupations (D) work room (E) seat customer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. work room\nExplanation: The hostess is greeting employees, which suggests that they are there for work-related purposes. Therefore, it is more likely that she would lead them to their work room rather than to group people, welcome guests, discuss their occupations, or seat customers."}}
{"Q": "Where is a likely place to store unused soap?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cabinet (B) supermarket (C) jail (D) butt (E) own home", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cabinet.\nExplanation: A cabinet is a common place to store unused soap in one's own home. It provides a dry and secure location to keep the soap until it is needed. Supermarkets and jails are not places where individuals typically store their personal items, and storing soap in one's butt is not a hygienic or practical option."}}
{"Q": "Loss of someone you love can cause what kind of feeling in your heart?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) painful (B) happy (C) blind (D) contagious (E) bring joy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. painful\nExplanation: Losing someone you love can cause a deep sense of sadness and grief, which can be physically and emotionally painful. It can feel like a heavy weight on your heart and can be difficult to cope with. This is a natural and normal response to loss, and it is important to allow yourself to feel these emotions and seek support from loved ones or a professional if needed."}}
{"Q": "Where in your home would you keep a ballpoint pen when not in use?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) backpack (B) bank (C) desk drawer (D) eat cake (E) office desk", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. desk drawer\nExplanation: Keeping a ballpoint pen in a desk drawer is a common and practical option for many people. It allows easy access to the pen when needed and keeps it organized and out of the way when not in use. A backpack may be a good option for carrying a pen on-the-go, but not for storage at home. A bank is not a suitable place to keep a personal pen, and \"eat cake\" is not a relevant option. An office desk is also a plausible answer, but it is more specific than the general \"desk drawer\" option."}}
{"Q": "James was someone who was caught in his own delusions.  To him, the truth didn't do what what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) work to advantage (B) matter to (C) help (D) free mind (E) further knowledge", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. matter to\nExplanation: James was caught in his own delusions, which means he was not able to see the truth or accept it. Therefore, the truth did not matter to him. He was living in his own world of illusions and was not willing to come out of it."}}
{"Q": "He wanted to live somewhere were every yard was uniform in size and landscaping, where should he look for a house?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) city (B) three feet (C) subdivision (D) parking garage (E) michigan", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. subdivision\nExplanation: Subdivisions are typically planned communities where the houses and yards are designed to be uniform in size and landscaping. This would be the most likely option for someone looking for this type of living arrangement. Cities and parking garages are unlikely to have yards, and three feet and Michigan are not relevant options."}}
{"Q": "The flasks was used to distill elements, where was is being used?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) laboratory (B) chemistry lab (C) coat pocket (D) after hours speakeasy (E) bordello", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. laboratory\nExplanation: Flasks are commonly used in laboratory settings for distillation and other chemical processes. It is unlikely that a flask would be used in a coat pocket, after hours speakeasy, or bordello. While a flask could potentially be used in a chemistry lab, this answer is more specific and less likely to be incorrect. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A. laboratory."}}
{"Q": "What was the man encouraged to do after he expressed his anger violently?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cool off (B) punch (C) illustrate point (D) fight (E) release energy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cool off.\nExplanation: When someone expresses their anger violently, it is important for them to take a step back and cool off. This can help them to calm down and think more clearly about the situation. Punching, fighting, or releasing energy in a violent way is not a healthy or productive way to deal with anger. Illustrating a point may be appropriate in some situations, but it should be done in a calm and respectful manner. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A. Cool off."}}
{"Q": "Where can a student learn to play a triangle?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) math class (B) math book (C) in pythagorus' band (D) orchestra (E) music class", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. music class\nExplanation: Learning to play a musical instrument such as the triangle would typically be taught in a music class. Math class and math books would not be relevant to learning a musical instrument, and while Pythagoras was known for his contributions to music theory, there is no evidence that he had a band that included the triangle. The orchestra is a possible answer, but it is more specific than the general option of a music class, which could include instruction on a variety of instruments."}}
{"Q": "What do you need to do to use television if it is already turned on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) get wet (B) open eyes (C) kill (D) plug in (E) first turn on power", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Open eyes.\nExplanation: If the television is already turned on, the only thing you need to do to use it is to open your eyes and look at the screen. This will allow you to see and hear whatever is being broadcast or played on the television. The other options listed (getting wet, killing, plugging in, and turning on power) are either irrelevant or impossible in this context."}}
{"Q": "The guys had a regular poker game, rather than going to the movies this what their what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) competition (B) fun game (C) losing money (D) fun (E) social event", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. social event\nExplanation: The fact that the guys had a regular poker game suggests that it was a recurring event that they looked forward to. Additionally, the use of the word \"regular\" implies that it was a social gathering that they enjoyed, rather than a competition or a losing money situation. Going to the movies could also be a social event, but the use of \"rather than\" suggests that the guys preferred the poker game as a way to spend time together."}}
{"Q": "When you stroke a dogs fur what have you done?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) start fighting (B) play (C) lots of attention (D) petted (E) bone", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. petted.\nExplanation: When you stroke a dog's fur, you are giving them affection and attention by gently running your hand over their coat. This is commonly referred to as petting and is a way to show love and care for your furry friend. It can also be a way to calm and soothe a dog, as many dogs find the sensation of being petted to be relaxing."}}
{"Q": "Dan fell off a bar stool.  He did this because he was what than ever before?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) kitchen (B) drunker (C) tavern (D) restaurant (E) shorter", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Drunker.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Dan fell off the bar stool because he was drunker than ever before. The fact that he was on a bar stool suggests that he was in a tavern or restaurant, but the question does not provide enough information to definitively choose between those options. The answer \"kitchen\" and \"shorter\" do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The wood was still rough to the touch, what did the woodworker have to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) petrify (B) sanded (C) warp (D) composted (E) clean", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. sanded\nExplanation: Sanding is a process of smoothing the surface of wood by rubbing it with an abrasive material. If the wood is still rough to the touch, the woodworker would need to sand it to achieve a smooth finish. Petrifying involves turning organic material into stone, warping involves bending or twisting the wood, composting involves decomposing organic material, and cleaning involves removing dirt or debris, none of which would address the roughness of the wood."}}
{"Q": "The chief saw his entire tribe wiped out, he was a leader with a single what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) peon (B) indian (C) minister (D) follower (E) employee", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) follower\nExplanation: The word \"chief\" implies that the person was a leader of a tribe. Therefore, it is more likely that he had followers rather than employees, peons, ministers, or Indians (as he himself was likely an Indian). The fact that his entire tribe was wiped out suggests that he was the only survivor, making it even more likely that he was a leader with followers."}}
{"Q": "The flower grew tall to compete for sunlight, what did its neighbor do?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) blossom (B) park (C) open (D) cast shadow (E) vase", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. cast shadow\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the flower grew tall to compete for sunlight, which implies that there is another object nearby that is blocking the sunlight. The most plausible answer from the given choices is D, cast shadow, as it fits the context of the sentence. The neighbor object could be a tree or a building that is casting a shadow on the flower, making it grow taller to reach the sunlight."}}
{"Q": "If while driving to work another car makes a careless maneuver, what emotion might you feel?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) boredom (B) happiness (C) transportation cost (D) getting there (E) road rage", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. road rage\nExplanation: Road rage is a common emotion that people feel when they encounter careless drivers on the road. It is a feeling of anger and frustration that can lead to aggressive behavior. This emotion is understandable as it can be dangerous and frustrating when other drivers make careless maneuvers on the road. However, it is important to manage this emotion and not let it escalate into dangerous behavior."}}
{"Q": "What kind of food makes someone sick?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) boat (B) necessary to live (C) edible (D) unhealthy (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Unhealthy food can make someone sick if consumed in excess or if it contains harmful ingredients such as bacteria, viruses, or toxins. Examples of unhealthy foods that can cause illness include undercooked meat, contaminated produce, and foods high in sugar, salt, or saturated fats. It is important to maintain a balanced and nutritious diet to avoid getting sick from food."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find the sharpest parts of a triangle?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) three vertices (B) point (C) 3 sides (D) three sides (E) math book", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Three vertices.\nExplanation: The vertices of a triangle are the points where the three sides meet. Since they are points, they have no length or width, making them the sharpest parts of the triangle. The sides and the point where the three sides meet (known as the centroid) are not as sharp as the vertices. Therefore, the correct answer is A."}}
{"Q": "How might a automobile get off a freeway?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) exit ramp (B) garage (C) driveway (D) repair shop (E) stop light", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Exit ramp.\nExplanation: An exit ramp is a designated roadway that allows vehicles to safely exit a freeway or highway. It typically leads to a local road or street, providing drivers with a safe and controlled way to leave the freeway. Garages, driveways, and repair shops are not typically located directly off of freeways, and stop lights are not a reliable way to exit a freeway as they are typically located at intersections and not on the freeway itself."}}
{"Q": "What does going to bed with your spouse for sex lead to?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) bad dreams (B) a good nights sleep (C) rest (D) sleepiness (E) get pregnant", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. a good night's sleep.\nExplanation: Going to bed with your spouse for sex can lead to physical and emotional intimacy, which can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. This can lead to a better quality of sleep, resulting in feeling more rested and refreshed in the morning. However, it is important to note that this answer may not apply to everyone and individual experiences may vary."}}
{"Q": "What would it be if they get a surprising show over and over?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) surprise (B) fight (C) annoyance (D) might scare (E) irritated", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Surprise.\nExplanation: If someone gets a surprising show over and over, it is likely to cause surprise each time. The other options such as fight, annoyance, might scare, or irritated do not fit the context as they do not necessarily result from getting a surprising show repeatedly."}}
{"Q": "Sally thought that competing wasn't worth the risk. If she pushed more what might happen?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) pressure (B) trying harder (C) put harder (D) enemies (E) death", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. trying harder.\nExplanation: If Sally pushed more, she might try harder to compete and improve her skills. This could lead to a better chance of success and a higher reward, making the risk more worth it. It is unlikely that pushing more would result in pressure, putting harder, enemies, or death."}}
{"Q": "John is sitting in a toilet stall in a bathroom, outside he can hear cars going around in circles.  What is the function of the place he is most likely at?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) eating food (B) public place (C) race track (D) at hotel (E) public building", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (E) public building\n\nExplanation: The fact that John is in a toilet stall in a bathroom suggests that he is in a public building, such as a mall, airport, or office building. The sound of cars going around in circles could be coming from outside the building, indicating that it is located near a busy road or intersection. It is unlikely that John is eating food or at a hotel, as these activities would not typically take place in a bathroom stall. While a race track is a possibility, it is less likely than a public building given the context provided."}}
{"Q": "What event might one buy tickets for seats?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) park (B) show (C) auditorium (D) movies (E) rest area", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Show.\nExplanation: One would typically buy tickets for seats to attend a show, such as a concert, theater performance, or sporting event. Parks and rest areas are typically free to enter, while movies can be purchased online or at the theater without necessarily needing to reserve specific seats. An auditorium may also host shows, but it is not as commonly associated with ticketed seating as a theater or concert venue."}}
{"Q": "The merchant wanted to open in a high-traffic space, where did he rent space?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) mall (B) business (C) store (D) sale (E) sell goods", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. mall\nExplanation: A mall is a high-traffic space where many people go to shop, eat, and socialize. It is a popular location for businesses to rent space because of the large number of potential customers. Therefore, it is more plausible that the merchant rented space in a mall rather than a business or a store. The options of \"sale\" and \"sell goods\" are not relevant to the question as they do not refer to a specific location."}}
{"Q": "The newlyweds began copulating their marriage, they wanted many what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) babies (B) odors (C) sadness (D) rapport (E) ejaculation", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. babies\nExplanation: The word \"copulating\" refers to sexual intercourse, which is often associated with procreation. The fact that the newlyweds \"wanted many\" suggests that they were eager to start a family and have children. Therefore, option A, babies, is the most plausible answer. Options B, C, D, and E do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "How does a planet usually move around the sun?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) writing (B) universe (C) outer space (D) outerspace (E) orbit", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: A planet usually moves around the sun in an orbit, which is a path that is determined by the gravitational pull of the sun. The planet follows a curved path around the sun, which is called an orbit. This path is not a straight line, but rather a curved path that is determined by the gravitational pull of the sun. The orbit of a planet is elliptical in shape, which means that it is not a perfect circle, but rather an oval shape."}}
{"Q": "When a group of people are talking at work they might be doing what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) having a concert. (B) cough (C) sharing of ideas (D) speak (E) sneeze", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. sharing of ideas.\nExplanation: When a group of people are talking at work, it is likely that they are discussing work-related topics, sharing their thoughts and ideas, and collaborating on projects. This is an important aspect of teamwork and communication in the workplace. The other options, such as having a concert, coughing, speaking, or sneezing, are not relevant or appropriate in this context."}}
{"Q": "What emotion leads to punching?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) fists (B) hitting (C) boxing gloves (D) anger (E) hands", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Anger is the emotion that often leads to punching. When someone is angry, they may feel the need to release their frustration physically, which can result in punching. This behavior is not condoned and can lead to harm to oneself or others. It is important to find healthy ways to manage and express anger."}}
{"Q": "They kept doing things the same, she suggested they also try doing things what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) differently (B) otherwise (C) expensive (D) only (E) mere", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. differently\nExplanation: The word \"also\" in the sentence suggests that the speaker is proposing an additional option to what they have been doing. The word \"differently\" is the most appropriate choice as it means in a different manner or way. The other options, such as \"otherwise,\" \"expensive,\" \"only,\" and \"mere,\" do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Where could you find a shark before it was caught?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) pool hall (B) tomales bay (C) marine museum (D) business (E) desert", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. marine museum\nExplanation: Sharks are typically found in bodies of water such as oceans, seas, and rivers. Therefore, it is most likely that a shark would be found in a place that is related to marine life, such as a marine museum. A pool hall, business, or desert would not be suitable habitats for a shark, and Tamales Bay may have sharks in the surrounding waters, but it is not a guaranteed location to find one."}}
{"Q": "Where is one likely to find poker chips?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) supermarket (B) pantry (C) motherboard (D) bar (E) bar", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. bar\nExplanation: Poker chips are commonly used in gambling games, particularly in poker. Bars often have poker nights or other events where gambling is involved, making it a likely place to find poker chips. Supermarkets and pantries are unlikely to carry poker chips, and motherboards are a component of computers, not a place to find poker chips."}}
{"Q": "Dance can be elegant and specific, or you can just have fun and what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) falling down (B) trip (C) fall down (D) move around (E) celebrate", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: When dancing, you can choose to be elegant and specific with your movements, or you can just let loose and move around for fun. Dancing doesn't necessarily have to involve falling down or tripping, but it can be a way to celebrate and enjoy yourself. Option D, \"move around,\" is a more plausible answer as it aligns with the idea of having fun while dancing."}}
{"Q": "Where can one obtain a bass fiddle?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) jazz band (B) string quartet (C) group band (D) nursery rhyme (E) music store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. music store\nExplanation: A bass fiddle, also known as a double bass or upright bass, is a common instrument found in many genres of music, including jazz, classical, and rock. While it is possible to find bass fiddles in jazz bands, string quartets, and group bands, the most likely place to obtain one would be a music store. Music stores specialize in selling a variety of instruments, including bass fiddles, and often have a range of options to choose from. Additionally, music stores may offer rental options for those who are not ready to commit to purchasing a bass fiddle outright."}}
{"Q": "Why does having a disability sometimes making academic tasks hard for a person?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) mentally challenged (B) have choice (C) lots of space (D) hungry (E) acknowledgment", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. mentally challenged\nExplanation: Having a disability can sometimes mean that a person has cognitive or physical limitations that make academic tasks more difficult. For example, a person with a learning disability may struggle with reading or writing, while a person with a physical disability may have difficulty with fine motor skills needed for tasks like writing or typing. These challenges can make it harder for a person to complete academic tasks and may require accommodations or support to help them succeed."}}
{"Q": "What is the purpose of playing games for children?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) winning (B) learning (C) losing (D) fatigue (E) skill", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The purpose of playing games for children is primarily learning. Through games, children can develop various skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, social skills, and creativity. Winning or losing may be a part of the game, but the primary focus should be on the learning experience. Playing games can also help children to reduce stress and fatigue, but these are secondary benefits. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}

{"Q": "People played a variety of games in the soccer field.  It was the closest thing they had to what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) town (B) beach (C) park (D) near (E) outside", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. park\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that people played games in a soccer field, which implies that the area was open and spacious. A park is a more plausible answer than a town or a beach, as parks are often designed for recreational activities and have open spaces for people to play games. Additionally, the use of the word \"field\" suggests that the area is more likely to be a park than a town or a beach."}}
{"Q": "What is likely to have a better school cafeteria?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) high school (B) canteen (C) polytechnic (D) large room (E) all kinds of schools", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Polytechnic.\nExplanation: Polytechnics are institutions that offer technical and vocational education, and they often have a focus on practical skills and hands-on learning. As such, they may have a better-equipped cafeteria that caters to the needs of students who are studying subjects like culinary arts, hospitality, and food science. Additionally, polytechnics may have more resources to invest in their cafeteria facilities and staff, as they often receive funding from industry partners and government agencies. While high schools and other types of schools may also have good cafeterias, a polytechnic is more likely to have a specialized and well-resourced food service program."}}

{"Q": "She wanted to get in shape, but she couldn't stay focused on the hour long what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sweating (B) excercise (C) work out (D) video (E) swim", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) work out\nExplanation: The phrase \"hour long\" suggests that the missing word is a noun that can be performed for a specific duration of time. \"Sweating\" and \"exercise\" are too general, while \"video\" and \"swim\" do not fit the context of the sentence. \"Work out\" is the most appropriate choice as it refers to a specific physical activity that can be done for an hour to improve fitness."}}
{"Q": "When you do something and have fun, its something you?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) spontaneous (B) stop working (C) pay for (D) do like (E) do enjoy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. do enjoy\nExplanation: When you do something and have fun, it means you enjoy doing it. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E. \"do enjoy.\" The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What is a salesman responsible to do at work?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) traveling to chicago (B) get fired (C) books (D) sell products (E) service account", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Sell products.\nExplanation: A salesman's primary responsibility is to sell products or services to customers. This involves identifying potential customers, presenting the product or service in a compelling way, and closing the sale. While traveling to different locations and servicing accounts may be part of the job, the ultimate goal is to generate revenue for the company by selling products. Failing to meet sales targets may result in disciplinary action or termination, so it is crucial for a salesman to focus on selling and meeting their quotas."}}
{"Q": "How does going jogging generally affect one's self esteem?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) feel better (B) feel pride (C) sweating (D) ocean (E) arthritis", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. feel better.\n\nExplanation: Going jogging generally has a positive effect on one's self-esteem as it releases endorphins, which are known to improve mood and reduce stress. Regular exercise can also lead to improved physical health and appearance, which can boost self-confidence and self-esteem. Therefore, it is more plausible that going jogging would make someone feel better about themselves rather than feeling pride, sweating, ocean, or arthritis."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find people standing in a line outside?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bus depot (B) end of line (C) opera (D) neighbor's house (E) meeting", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Bus depot.\nExplanation: People often stand in a line outside a bus depot waiting for their bus to arrive. This is a common scenario in many cities and towns where public transportation is widely used. The other options, such as end of line, opera, neighbor's house, and meeting, do not necessarily involve standing in a line outside."}}
{"Q": "If you are committing perjury you have done what while under oath?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) crime (B) disrespect judge (C) embarrassment (D) lie (E) indictment", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. crime\nExplanation: Perjury is the act of lying or giving false information while under oath in a court of law or other legal setting.

Therefore, a dictionary would be the most plausible source to find the meaning of \"ficus.\""}}
{"Q": "When are people buying products more?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) debt (B) economic boom (C) being able to use (D) disagreements (E) trading", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Economic boom.\nExplanation: During an economic boom, people tend to have more disposable income and are more willing to spend money on products. This is because they feel more secure in their financial situation and are more optimistic about the future. As a result, businesses often see an increase in sales during economic booms."}}
{"Q": "The buildings were intended to not have residential kitchens in them, what were they designed for?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) large city (B) small (C) eat cake (D) university (E) town", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. university\nExplanation: The fact that the buildings were not intended to have residential kitchens suggests that they were designed for a setting where people would not be living permanently, but rather for a temporary period of time. Universities often have dormitories or other types of student housing where students live for a few years, but they typically do not have full kitchens in each unit. Instead, students often eat in dining halls or other communal spaces. Therefore, it is likely that the buildings in question were designed for use in a university setting."}}
{"Q": "Animals come in all types, some fly thanks to their lightweight hollow what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) tails (B) bones (C) eyes (D) heads (E) bodies", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Animals that fly, such as birds and bats, have lightweight hollow bones that allow them to be light enough to take off and stay in the air.

The phrase \"it was all pretend\" implies that he thinks people are pretending or not being truthful. Therefore, option A, \"people believe,\" is the most plausible answer as it relates to the child's perception of others' beliefs and actions. The other options, such as daydreams, transcendentalism, laughter, and religion, do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Where is a lake likely to be glacial?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) michigan (B) new york (C) new york (D) mountains (E) countryside", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. mountains\n\nExplanation: Glaciers are formed in areas with high elevation and cold temperatures, such as mountains. As glaciers move, they can carve out valleys and create lakes. Therefore, a lake is more likely to be glacial if it is located in a mountainous region. Choices A, B, and C are all states or regions, and do not necessarily indicate a specific location where a lake may be found. Choice E, countryside, is too broad and does not provide any specific information about the location of a glacial lake."}}
{"Q": "They needed grape juice for their party, they went to buy it and other snacks at the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) field (B) restaurant (C) salad (D) market (E) food store", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (D) market, as it is a common place to buy groceries and snacks, including grape juice. A field would not be a likely place to find grape juice, a restaurant may not sell grape juice for takeout, a salad is a type of food and not a place to buy groceries, and a food store is too general and could refer to any type of food establishment."}}
{"Q": "Why do some people get passports and go to different locations?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) believe in god (B) smoke marijuana (C) desire to travel (D) use weapons (E) throw away", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. Desire to travel.\nExplanation: People get passports and travel to different locations because they have a desire to explore new places, experience different cultures, and broaden their horizons. Traveling can also be a way to relax, escape from daily routines, and create new memories. While some people may have other motivations for traveling, such as for work or education, the desire to travel is a common reason for obtaining a passport."}}
{"Q": "Where do apples form on an apple tree?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) south africa (B) sunshine (C) new york (D) bloom (E) trunk", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Bloom\nExplanation: Apples form on an apple tree after the tree has bloomed. During the blooming period, the tree produces flowers that are pollinated by bees or other insects.

It is a major city and downtown area, but the specific mention of Manhattan makes it the most plausible answer. The other choices, such as \"drink and dance\" and \"alcohol,\" are too broad and do not necessarily indicate a concentration of nightclubs."}}

{"Q": "What does someone stop doing when being dead?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) moving (B) working (C) breathing (D) alive (E) deadworks", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. breathing.\n\nExplanation: When someone is dead, their body ceases to function, including their respiratory system. Breathing is a vital function of living organisms, and without it, the body cannot sustain life. Therefore, it is safe to say that someone stops breathing when they are dead."}}
{"Q": "The place where my linen closet is really needs repainting a light color as it only has one overhead light.", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) house (B) home (C) pool house (D) hallway (E) bedroom", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Hallway.\nExplanation: The linen closet is usually located in the hallway, which is a narrow passage connecting different rooms in a house. As the statement mentions that the place only has one overhead light, it is more likely to be a hallway than a bedroom or a pool house. A house or a home is a broader term that encompasses all the rooms and spaces, so they are less likely to be the correct answer. Therefore, the most plausible answer is the hallway."}}
{"Q": "Punk rock music is an important part of what action sport?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) skate (B) listen (C) opera (D) opera (E) relax", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Punk rock music is closely associated with skateboarding culture, as both emerged in the 1970s and share a rebellious, DIY ethos. Many skate videos and events feature punk rock music, and many skateboarders identify with the punk rock subculture. Therefore, punk rock music is an important part of the action sport of skateboarding."}}

{"Q": "Where is a bird likely to make it's home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) forest (B) nest (C) roof (D) leaves (E) sky", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. forest\nExplanation: Birds typically make their homes in trees and bushes found in forests. These areas provide shelter, protection, and food sources for birds. While birds may build nests on roofs or in leaves, these locations are less common and not as ideal as a forest habitat. The sky is not a suitable location for a bird to make its home as it is not a physical structure that can provide shelter or protection."}}
{"Q": "When a person suffers from hunger early in the day what do they do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) eat hamburger (B) eat breakfast (C) open fridge (D) buy food (E) cook dinner", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. eat breakfast.\nExplanation: When a person suffers from hunger early in the day, the most plausible solution would be to eat breakfast. Breakfast is the first meal of the day and is essential to provide the body with the necessary nutrients and energy to start the day. Eating a balanced breakfast can help regulate blood sugar levels, improve cognitive function, and prevent overeating later in the day. Eating a hamburger, opening the fridge, buying food, or cooking dinner are not practical solutions for hunger early in the day."}}
{"Q": "How would you express information if you do not have a pen or pencil?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) may disagree (B) close mouth (C) write down (D) talk (E) eyes", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. talk\nExplanation: If you do not have a pen or pencil, the most plausible way to express information would be to talk. This could involve speaking to someone directly or using a device such as a phone or computer to communicate verbally. While options A, B, and E are not relevant to expressing information without a writing tool, option C (write down) is not possible without a pen or pencil. Therefore, talking is the most logical choice."}}
{"Q": "What does everyone feel of monsters?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) looking for love (B) afraid of (C) good at (D) make pet (E) different", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) afraid of\nExplanation: It is a common human instinct to feel afraid of monsters as they are often portrayed as dangerous and threatening creatures in popular culture. This fear may stem from a primal instinct to protect oneself from potential harm. While some people may find monsters fascinating or even enjoy watching horror movies featuring them, the majority of people are likely to feel some level of fear or discomfort around them."}}
{"Q": "Why does someone want to examine thing closely?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) buy (B) learn about (C) buy (D) complex (E) interesting", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.

This can result in slurred speech, impaired judgment, loss of coordination, and other negative effects. It can also lead to more serious consequences such as alcohol poisoning, accidents, and even death. While some people may experience nausea or vomiting as a result of drinking, these are not the only or most common outcomes of alcohol consumption."}}

It is also sometimes used in opera orchestras, but it is less common in school bands and would not typically be found in a music store or bathroom stall."}}
{"Q": "What is the opposite of a little of something?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) much (B) plenty (C) more (D) big (E) lot of", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. much\nExplanation: The opposite of a little of something is a large amount of something, which can be expressed as \"much.\" The other choices, such as \"plenty,\" \"more,\" \"big,\" and \"lot of,\" do not necessarily convey the opposite meaning of \"little.\""}}
{"Q": "The princess was pure, the evil wizard wished to do what to her?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) dirty (B) tarnish (C) corrupt (D) contaminated (E) applied", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C) corrupt\nExplanation: The word \"pure\" suggests that the princess is innocent and untainted. The evil wizard, therefore, would want to corrupt her, which means to make her morally impure or to lead her astray from her virtuous path. The other options, such as dirty, tarnish, contaminated, or applied, do not fit the context as well as corrupt does."}}
{"Q": "The piece of paper was worth a lot of money, it was an old Apple Inc what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) notebook (B) copy machine (C) stock certificate (D) ream (E) thumb drive", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. stock certificate\nExplanation: A stock certificate is a legal document that represents ownership in a company. Apple Inc is a well-known and successful company, so owning an old stock certificate could potentially be worth a lot of money to collectors or investors. A notebook, copy machine, ream, or thumb drive would not hold the same value as a stock certificate."}}
{"Q": "During the winter hunt he could hear every motion in the woods, this was because of the what of everything?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) being still (B) silence (C) stationary (D) stillness (E) standing still", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. stillness\nExplanation: The word \"stillness\" refers to the absence of movement or sound, which would make it easier for the hunter to hear every motion in the woods. The other choices, such as \"being still\" or \"standing still,\" imply that the hunter himself is not moving, which is not necessarily relevant to his ability to hear. \"Silence\" and \"stationary\" also do not capture the idea of the environment being quiet and motionless. Therefore, \"stillness\" is the most appropriate choice."}}
{"Q": "If a car-less person want to listen to talk radio in private, where might they listen to it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) trunk (B) bedroom (C) diner (D) space shuttle (E) shop", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. bedroom\nExplanation: A car-less person can listen to talk radio in their bedroom using a radio or a smartphone with internet access.

Living room.\nExplanation: The living room is the most common and practical place to have a fireplace in a house. It provides warmth and creates a cozy atmosphere for family gatherings and entertaining guests. A fireplace in a big house or cabin can also be a great addition, but it depends on the layout and design of the house. A train or home may not be suitable for a fireplace due to safety and space constraints."}}

It's important to keep a close eye on your cat and make sure they are safe from any potential threats, including dogs."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a kosher deli along side a number of different places to eat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) los angeles (B) food court (C) new york city (D) jewish community (E) jewish neighborhoods", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. food court\nExplanation: A food court is a common area in a shopping mall or airport where there are multiple food vendors offering different types of cuisine. It is plausible to find a kosher deli among other food options in a food court, as it caters to a diverse range of customers with varying dietary needs and preferences. While kosher delis are also commonly found in Jewish communities and neighborhoods, the food court option is more likely to have a variety of different places to eat alongside the kosher deli. Los Angeles and New York City are also plausible options, but they are not as specific as the food court choice."}}
{"Q": "What do you do when you're going to market?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) buy food (B) see other people (C) buying vegetables (D) buy a fat pig (E) traveling", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. buying vegetables.\nExplanation: When going to the market, one of the common things people do is to buy vegetables. This is because markets usually have a wide variety of fresh produce available, and buying vegetables is an essential part of grocery shopping for many people. While buying food (option A) is also a possibility, it is too broad and could include buying other things besides vegetables. Seeing other people (option B) and traveling (option E) are not necessarily related to going to the market, and buying a fat pig (option D) is not a common activity for most people."}}

{"Q": "What is the feeling of one having fun?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) smiling (B) pleasure (C) hurt (D) injuries (E) laughter", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. pleasure\nExplanation: Having fun typically brings about a feeling of pleasure, enjoyment, and satisfaction. It is a positive emotion that is often associated with engaging in activities that one finds enjoyable or entertaining. While smiling and laughter may also be present during fun activities, they are not necessarily indicative of the feeling of having fun itself. Hurt and injuries, on the other hand, are typically associated with negative experiences and are not related to the feeling of having fun."}}

Born again.\nExplanation: Christians believe that salvation and entry into heaven come through faith in Jesus Christ and being born again spiritually. This means accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior, repenting of sins, and committing to follow Him. It is not based on one's ability to work or any physical characteristic like a change of color. Death is a necessary step in the process, but it is not the determining factor for entry into heaven. The concept of no longer existing is not relevant to Christian beliefs about the afterlife."}}
{"Q": "James loved to surf but he wasn't good at it. He would always do what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) wipe out (B) enjoy yourself (C) start fighting (D) get wet (E) drown", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. wipe out.\nExplanation: Wiping out is a common term used in surfing when a surfer falls off their board and into the water. Since James is not good at surfing, it is likely that he would frequently wipe out while attempting to catch waves. The other options, such as drowning or starting a fight, are unlikely and extreme outcomes. Enjoying himself and getting wet are possible, but not specific to James' lack of skill in surfing."}}
{"Q": "Sarah gave her brother a guy to her home.

Going to church may be seen as a way to seek forgiveness and absolution for their actions. It is unlikely that the murderer would feel religious or retaliate against themselves, and anguish may be a possible emotion but not necessarily the reason for going to church."}}
{"Q": "What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) die (B) interruption (C) bleed (D) hatred (E) dying", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. interruption\nExplanation: An unsuccessful suicide attempt means that the person did not die from the attempt.

{"Q": "Bob stands in the grass surrounded by trees and nature, where is Bob?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) rest area (B) desert (C) state park (D) fairgrounds (E) soccer game", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. state park.\nExplanation: The description of Bob being surrounded by trees and nature suggests that he is in a natural setting, which is more likely to be a state park than a rest area, fairgrounds, or a soccer game. The option of a desert is unlikely as deserts are typically characterized by a lack of vegetation."}}
{"Q": "Bart entered his horse into the contest.  Where did he do this?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) circus (B) in kentucky (C) western movie (D) central park (E) state fair", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. state fair\nExplanation: State fairs often have horse shows and contests, making it a more plausible location for Bart to enter his horse into a contest. The other options (circus, western movie, central park) are less likely to have horse contests or shows. Kentucky is known for horse racing, but the question does not specify that Bart entered his horse in a race."}}
{"Q": "From where does a snowflake form?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cloud (B) snow storm (C) billow (D) air (E) snowstorm", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. cloud\n\nExplanation: Snowflakes form in clouds when water vapor freezes into ice crystals around a tiny particle, such as dust or pollen. As the ice crystals grow, they take on different shapes and patterns depending on the temperature and humidity levels in the cloud. Eventually, the snowflakes become heavy enough to fall to the ground as snow. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A. cloud."}}
{"Q": "All the power tools like the drill used for fixing cars made for a very loud workplace where?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) basement (B) work shop (C) tool shed (D) repair shop (E) store room", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. Repair shop.\nExplanation: Power tools like drills are commonly used in repair shops where cars are fixed. These tools are designed to be powerful and efficient, but they also produce a lot of noise. Therefore, it is more plausible that a repair shop would be a very loud workplace due to the use of power tools. The other options, such as basement, tool shed, and store room, are less likely to be used for car repairs and would not typically have the same level of noise associated with them. A workshop could also be a possibility, but a repair shop is a more specific and likely answer."}}
{"Q": "Applying for a job can make someone feel what sort of emotion, even if they get it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) working hard (B) frustration (C) rejection (D) defeat (E) stress", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Stress.\nExplanation: Applying for a job can be a stressful experience, even if the person ultimately gets the job. The process of preparing a resume, writing a cover letter, and going through interviews can be nerve-wracking and anxiety-inducing. Even after getting the job, there may be stress associated with starting a new position and meeting expectations. Therefore, stress is a more plausible answer than the other options."}}
{"Q": "A farmer sees a weasel in the woods, where is the farmer?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) chicken coop (B) beach (C) fairytale (D) great outdoors (E) corn fields", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. great outdoors\nExplanation: Since the weasel is seen in the woods, it is likely that the farmer is also in the woods or the surrounding area, which would be considered the great outdoors. The other options, such as a chicken coop or corn fields, do not necessarily indicate the presence of woods or a weasel. The beach and fairytale options are even less likely to be associated with a weasel sighting."}}
{"Q": "He picked up the perfect pebble, he planned to skip it across the entire small what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) manual (B) lake (C) aquarium (D) pond (E) playground", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) pond\nExplanation: Skipping pebbles across a body of water is a common activity, and the most likely body of water to skip pebbles across would be a pond. The other options, such as a manual or an aquarium, are not typically places where one would skip pebbles. A playground could have a small body of water, but it would be more likely to be a pond than any of the other options."}}
{"Q": "Traveling from new place to new place is likely to be what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) going somewhere (B) exhilarating (C) diarrhea (D) relocation (E) exhausting", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. exhilarating\nExplanation: Traveling from new place to new place can be exciting and full of new experiences. It can be a chance to explore new cultures, try new foods, and see new sights. While it may also be tiring, the word \"exhausting\" implies a negative connotation, whereas \"exhilarating\" suggests a positive and thrilling experience. \"Going somewhere\" and \"relocation\" are too general and do not capture the excitement of traveling to new places. \"Diarrhea\" is not a likely outcome of traveling, although it may be a risk in some destinations."}}
{"Q": "Turkey only has a small northern part of their country located in part of the what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) middle east (B) oven (C) balkan peninsula (D) provide meat (E) asia minor", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Asia Minor\nExplanation: Turkey is located in both Europe and Asia, with the majority of its landmass located in Asia Minor (also known as Anatolia). The small northern part of Turkey is also located in Asia Minor. The Balkan Peninsula is located to the northwest of Turkey, but it does not have any significant territory within Turkey's borders. \"Oven\" and \"provide meat\" are not relevant to Turkey's geography. While Turkey has cultural and historical ties to the Middle East, it is not considered part of the Middle East geographically."}}
{"Q": "Where might someone store a reusable shopping bag?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) supermarket (B) home (C) mart (D) obesity (E) closet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Home.\nExplanation: A reusable shopping bag is typically used for carrying groceries or other items purchased while shopping. It is most likely to be stored at home, where it can be easily accessed before heading out to the store. While it is possible to store a reusable shopping bag at a supermarket or mart, it is not a common practice. Storing it in a closet is also a plausible option, but it is still most likely to be stored at home. The option of obesity is not relevant to the question."}}
{"Q": "How could you have fun by yourself with no one around you?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) fairgrounds (B) watching television (C) tired (D) enjoyable (E) friend's house", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (D) enjoyable\nExplanation: There are many ways to have fun by yourself without anyone around, such as reading a book, listening to music, playing a video game, going for a walk, or trying a new hobby. The key is to find something that you enjoy and that can keep you entertained. Choosing (D) enjoyable as the answer allows for a wide range of activities that can be tailored to personal interests and preferences."}}
{"Q": "The potato might be the official vegetable of what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) vegans (B) kitchen cupboard (C) restaurants (D) chicken (E) maryland", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) kitchen cupboard\nExplanation: Potatoes are a staple ingredient in many households and are commonly found in kitchen cupboards around the world. They are versatile and can be used in a variety of dishes, making them a popular choice for home cooks. While they are also a popular vegetable in restaurants, it is more likely that they would be considered the official vegetable of the kitchen cupboard."}}
{"Q": "Where is the sky most beautiful?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) planetarium (B) outdoors (C) atmosphere (D) night (E) photo", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Outdoors.\nExplanation: The sky is most beautiful when viewed outdoors, away from artificial lights and obstructions. The natural beauty of the sky can be appreciated best when viewed in its natural setting. The colors of the sky during sunrise and sunset, the stars at night, and the changing patterns of clouds are all best experienced outdoors. While a planetarium or a photo can provide a glimpse of the sky's beauty, they cannot match the immersive experience of being outdoors and witnessing the sky's wonders firsthand."}}
{"Q": "What type of fruit is easily broken in to sections?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) slide (B) citrus (C) band (D) orchestra (E) coconut", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Citrus.\n\nExplanation: Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines, are easily broken into sections or segments. These segments are called \"suprèmes\" and are separated by the natural membranes of the fruit. This makes them easy to eat and also convenient for use in recipes. The other options, such as slide, band, orchestra, and coconut, are not fruits that are typically broken into sections."}}
{"Q": "Marathoners feel fatigued after running twenty six miles, but some that have pushed them self too hard might be prone to what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) excruciating pain (B) passing out (C) death (D) drunk (E) exhaustion", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. passing out.\n\nExplanation: Marathoners who push themselves too hard may experience a drop in blood pressure and blood sugar levels, leading to dizziness and fainting. While excruciating pain and exhaustion are common after running a marathon, death is a rare occurrence and typically only happens in extreme cases. Drunkenness is not a plausible answer as alcohol consumption is not typically associated with marathon running."}}
{"Q": "Billy liked driving cars.  He was good at it.  But he was rattled ever since his father experienced what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) transportation (B) pollution (C) stress (D) death (E) go somewhere", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (D) death. The sentence suggests that Billy was rattled after his father experienced something, and death is the most traumatic event that could happen to a person. It is possible that Billy's father died in a car accident, which could explain why Billy was rattled despite his love for driving cars."}}
{"Q": "I am cold, what should I do to stay warm?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) stay in bed (B) light fire (C) freezer (D) lay on ice (E) spit", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Light fire.\nExplanation: Lighting a fire is a common and effective way to stay warm when feeling cold. The heat from the fire will warm up the surrounding area and help to regulate body temperature. It is important to ensure that the fire is lit in a safe and controlled manner, and that proper precautions are taken to prevent accidents or injuries."}}
{"Q": "Copulating with the wrong partner may be ill advised, many diseases can be transferred that can cause different types of what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) intense pleasure (B) ejaculation (C) period of rest (D) enjoyment (E) skin irritation", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. skin irritation\nExplanation: Copulating with the wrong partner can lead to the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, which can cause skin irritation and other uncomfortable symptoms. It is important to practice safe sex and only engage in sexual activity with partners who have been tested and are free of STIs."}}
{"Q": "What do audiences clap for?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cinema (B) theatre (C) movies (D) show (E) hockey game", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. theatre\nExplanation: Audiences typically clap in appreciation after a live theatre performance. It is a way to show their admiration for the actors, the production, and the overall experience. While audiences may also clap at the end of a movie or show, it is not as common as in live theatre. Clapping at a hockey game is more related to cheering for a team's success rather than showing appreciation for a performance. Clapping in a cinema is also not common as it may disturb other viewers."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get a balalaika if you do not have one?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) orchestra (B) music store (C) buy music (D) make music (E) symphony", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Music store.\nExplanation: A music store is the most likely place to purchase a balalaika, as it is a specialized musical instrument that may not be readily available in other locations. While it is possible that an orchestra or symphony may have a balalaika, it is unlikely that they would sell it to an individual. Buying music or making music does not necessarily involve purchasing an instrument, and therefore would not be a viable option for obtaining a balalaika."}}
{"Q": "Hoping for a beautiful day, what did the clouds do that disappointed everyone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) homely (B) overcast (C) hideous (D) overrated (E) misshapen", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. overcast\nExplanation: Overcast clouds are thick and gray, blocking out the sun and making it difficult to have a beautiful day. This is a common disappointment for those hoping for clear skies and sunshine. The other choices (homely, hideous, misshapen, and overrated) do not accurately describe the negative impact that clouds can have on the weather."}}
{"Q": "What type of demands to the unions need to be making to go off strike?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) reasonable (B) more money (C) not go to work (D) return to work (E) union", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. reasonable\nExplanation: In order for the unions to go off strike, they need to make reasonable demands that can be met by the employer. These demands should be fair and justifiable, and should take into account the needs of both the workers and the company. Demands for more money or not going to work may not be feasible or realistic, and may not lead to a resolution of the strike. The unions should focus on making reasonable demands that can be negotiated and agreed upon by both parties."}}
{"Q": "The landscaper was carefully arching stones together, he was creating an elaborate what over the creek?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) park (B) made from rocks (C) balloon (D) field (E) bridge", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. bridge\nExplanation: The use of the word \"arching\" suggests that the stones are being arranged in a curved shape, which is a common technique used in the construction of bridges. Additionally, the fact that the stones are being placed over a creek further supports the idea that a bridge is being built. Choices A, B, C, and D do not fit the context of the sentence as well as choice E."}}
{"Q": "John was not happy with his marriage. He and his wife drifted apart.     All and all, recent turns could be described as what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) inappropriate (B) sadness (C) unsatisfied (D) unfortunate (E) disenchanted", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (E) disenchanted\nExplanation: The word \"drifted apart\" suggests a gradual loss of connection and interest, which aligns with the definition of being disenchanted. The other choices do not accurately capture the situation described in the question."}}
{"Q": "The poor girls needed a light to see, what was the relationship between that light and finishing her homework?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) darkness (B) cumbersome (C) obesity (D) forceful (E) crucial", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E) crucial\nExplanation: The word \"crucial\" means extremely important or necessary. In this context, the poor girls needed a light to see in order to finish their homework, which suggests that the light was essential or crucial to completing their task. The other answer choices do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a ticket booth and see a concert?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) clerk (B) indoors (C) movie theater (D) venue (E) auditorium", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. venue\nExplanation: A ticket booth is typically located at the entrance of a venue where events such as concerts are held. The venue could be an outdoor amphitheater, indoor arena, or any other location where live performances take place. Therefore, option D is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Who is not famous for a superhighway with no speed limit?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) europe (B) germany (C) industrialized country (D) city (E) america", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Europe.\nExplanation: While Germany is known for its famous autobahn with no speed limit, Europe as a whole does not have a superhighway with no speed limit. Some countries in Europe do have sections of highways with no speed limit, but it is not a widespread practice throughout the continent. Additionally, the other answer choices (industrialized country, city, and America) do not specifically relate to a superhighway with no speed limit."}}
{"Q": "The low trickle of water revealed a stone, where was the stone found?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) ocean (B) gallbladder (C) driveway (D) river bed (E) creek bed", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. river bed\nExplanation: The low trickle of water suggests a small amount of water flowing, which is more likely to be found in a river or creek bed rather than the ocean. The stone could have been uncovered by the movement of the water in the river bed. Gallbladder and driveway are unlikely locations for a stone to be found in this context."}}
{"Q": "Where is the closest place from where you could borrow salt?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) ocean water (B) table (C) shaker (D) neighbor's house (E) lake", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. neighbor's house.\nExplanation: Borrowing salt from a neighbor's house is a more plausible answer as it is a common practice to borrow small items like salt from neighbors in case of emergency. The other options like ocean water, lake, table, and shaker are not practical sources of salt for borrowing."}}
{"Q": "No matter what date you put on it, we all know the universe to be what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) very old (B) infiniverse (C) getting younger (D) infinite (E) real", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. very old\nExplanation: The current scientific consensus is that the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old. This age has been determined through various methods, including observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the study of the expansion rate of the universe.

This behavior can be physical, verbal, or emotional and is often repeated over time. It can cause significant harm to the victim's mental and emotional well-being and can lead to long-term consequences such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem."}}
{"Q": "She had an interest in the man, what did she want to do with him?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) see particular program (B) see exhibits (C) see people play game (D) have conversation (E) watch film", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. have conversation.\n\nExplanation: The question does not provide enough context to determine the woman's intentions with the man. However, out of the given choices, having a conversation seems like the most plausible option as it is a common way for people to get to know each other and express their interests. The other options, such as seeing a particular program or watching a film, do not necessarily involve interacting with the man and may not be indicative of her interest in him."}}
{"Q": "Where is a drug kept in a home bathroom?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) nursery (B) ghetto (C) cupboard (D) pharmacy (E) medicine cabinet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. medicine cabinet\nExplanation: A medicine cabinet is a common storage location for drugs in a home bathroom. It is typically a small cabinet or shelf above the sink where medications, first aid supplies, and personal care items are kept.

Universities typically have designated study areas, libraries, and classrooms where students can sit in chairs and work towards their degree. The other options, such as an airport, church, or furniture store, are less likely places for someone to work on an advanced degree. The living room could be a possibility, but it is not as specific as the university option."}}

Therefore, the most plausible answer is D, farming areas. While A, countryside, and E, Illinois, may also be associated with farming, they are not as specific as D. Michigan and North Dakota are states and do not necessarily relate to the use of farm land."}}
{"Q": "A good interview after applying for a job may cause you to feel what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) offer (B) income (C) rejection (D) hostile (E) hope", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: A good interview after applying for a job may cause you to feel hopeful that you will receive an offer. A positive interview experience can increase your chances of being selected for the position and can leave you feeling optimistic about your prospects.

Tire wear.\nExplanation: When driving, the tires of the vehicle are in constant contact with the road surface, causing friction and wear on the tires. This wear can be accelerated by factors such as driving style, road conditions, and tire maintenance. Over time, tire wear can lead to decreased traction, reduced fuel efficiency, and even tire failure, making it an important factor to consider for safe and efficient driving."}}
{"Q": "What are our bodies doing after having food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) falling down (B) digesting (C) gas (D) weight gain (E) not hungry", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Digesting.\n\nExplanation: After having food, our bodies start the process of digestion. This involves breaking down the food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and used by the body for energy and other functions. Digestion involves the release of enzymes and other digestive juices, as well as contractions of the muscles in the digestive tract to move the food along. It can take several hours for the food to be fully digested and absorbed, depending on the type and amount of food consumed."}}
{"Q": "Why would one try to avoid work?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) making money (B) leave home (C) success (D) malaise (E) bad mood", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. malaise\nExplanation: Malaise refers to a general feeling of discomfort or unease, often accompanied by a lack of motivation or energy. If someone is experiencing malaise, they may try to avoid work because they simply don't feel up to it. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as stress, illness, or burnout. While making money, leaving home, achieving success, or being in a bad mood could all be factors that influence someone's decision to avoid work, malaise is a more plausible explanation for a general lack of motivation or energy."}}

In response, the lion would likely take an aggressive attitude to assert dominance and intimidate its competitor. This would increase the lion's chances of winning any potential conflict or competition for resources."}}
{"Q": "John felt a snake slither over him as he rested.  He was afraid to raise his covers for fear of startling it.  Where might he be?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) pet shops (B) oklahoma (C) basement (D) bedroom (E) dreams", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. bedroom.\n\nExplanation: Since John is resting in his bedroom, it is more plausible that he would feel a snake slither over him in his own bedroom rather than in a pet shop or basement. Oklahoma and dreams are not relevant to the scenario. Therefore, the most likely answer is that John is in his bedroom."}}
{"Q": "Where can you find a place to eat in an urban area close to local nightlife?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) city (B) downtown (C) mall (D) shopping center (E) own house", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. downtown.\nExplanation: Downtown areas in urban areas are often close to local nightlife and offer a variety of dining options, from casual to upscale. Many restaurants in downtown areas also stay open later to accommodate those enjoying the nightlife. Malls and shopping centers may have food options, but they are typically more geared towards quick bites and fast food rather than sit-down restaurants. Your own house is not a viable option for finding a place to eat in an urban area close to local nightlife."}}
{"Q": "You have to a lot of thinking while studying a new subject, but it is how you gain what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) fatigue (B) depression (C) best way (D) weight (E) knowledge", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: When studying a new subject, it requires a lot of mental effort and concentration. This can be tiring, but ultimately it leads to gaining knowledge and understanding of the subject. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E, knowledge."}}
{"Q": "How will you communicate if you are far away from who you want to communicate with?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) think (B) talk with people (C) talk to people (D) speak out (E) send email", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. Send email.\nExplanation: If you are far away from the person you want to communicate with, sending an email is a more plausible option as it allows you to communicate instantly and effectively. It is also a convenient way to share information, documents, and media files. While thinking, talking with people, talking to people, and speaking out are all forms of communication, they may not be practical or effective if the person you want to communicate with is not physically present."}}
{"Q": "Why would you not trust your friends after chatting with friends?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) fever (B) smoke (C) laughing (D) coughing (E) lie", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. lie\nExplanation: If your friends lied to you during the chat, it would be reasonable to question their trustworthiness. If they were caught in a lie, it could indicate that they are not honest or reliable, which could make it difficult to trust them in the future. Fever, smoke, laughing, and coughing are not relevant factors in determining trustworthiness after chatting with friends."}}
{"Q": "He came from old money and had a fortune, but he made new money making shrewd trades where?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) eat cake (B) cookie (C) stock market (D) real estate (E) treasure chest", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. stock market.\nExplanation: Making shrewd trades typically refers to investing in the stock market, where one can buy and sell stocks for profit. Real estate is also a common way to make money, but it is less likely to be described as \"shrewd trades.\" Eating cake, cookies, or finding a treasure chest are not realistic ways to make money through trading. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C. stock market."}}
{"Q": "Animals make up a large part of the?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) carrying cargo (B) favorite (C) ecosystem (D) nature (E) ecology", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Animals play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. They are an integral part of the food chain and help in pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling. Without animals, the ecosystem would be severely impacted, leading to a decline in biodiversity and the overall health of the environment. Therefore, animals make up a large part of the ecosystem."}}
{"Q": "At a shop what can you buy to put your spare unused things?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) basement (B) cardboard box (C) ocean floor (D) high school (E) container", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. container\nExplanation: At a shop, you can buy containers to put your spare unused things. Containers come in various sizes and materials, such as plastic, glass, or metal, and can be used to store items in an organized and safe manner. A cardboard box could also be a temporary solution, but it may not be as durable or secure as a container. The basement and ocean floor are not options for purchasing at a shop, and high school is not relevant to this question."}}
{"Q": "A person with digestion issues eats a meat-filled breakfast, what does he feel?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) heartburn (B) overeating (C) happiness (D) being satisfied (E) gain energy", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. heartburn\n\nExplanation: A person with digestion issues may experience heartburn after eating a meat-filled breakfast. Meat is high in protein and fat, which can be difficult for some people to digest, leading to discomfort and heartburn. This is especially true if the person has a condition like acid reflux or GERD. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person would feel heartburn rather than overeating, happiness, being satisfied, or gaining energy."}}
{"Q": "What is a prisoner sentenced to do?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) scape jail (B) dream of freedom (C) become a hairdresser (D) attempt to escape (E) do time", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: E. do time\nExplanation: When a person is sentenced to prison, they are required to serve a certain amount of time as punishment for their crime. This means they must remain in prison and follow the rules and regulations set by the prison authorities until their sentence is complete. While some prisoners may attempt to escape, this is not a requirement of their sentence and is actually a criminal offense that can result in additional charges and a longer prison sentence. Becoming a hairdresser or dreaming of freedom are not relevant to the sentence a prisoner receives."}}
{"Q": "Jesse  enjoyed remembering the past because he helped him understand it.  And understanding the past helped him with doing what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) phoning (B) nostalgia (C) writing down (D) active (E) being prepared", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D. active\n\nExplanation: Understanding the past can help someone be more active in the present. By learning from past experiences, Jesse can make better decisions and take more effective actions in his current life. This answer is the most logical choice as the other options do not directly relate to the benefits of understanding the past."}}
{"Q": "David watched some nesting birds using his binoculars while on vacation.  Where might David be?.", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sky (B) vaccation (C) forest (D) countryside (E) roof", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. forest\nExplanation: It is more likely that David would be in a forest if he is watching nesting birds with binoculars. Birds typically nest in trees and wooded areas, making a forest the most plausible location for bird watching. While it is possible that David could be on a roof or in the countryside, these options are less likely given the context of the question. The sky is also an unlikely option as it would be difficult to observe nesting birds from such a distance without specialized equipment. Finally, the fact that David is on vacation is not relevant to determining his location for bird watching."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find many varieties of plants including a rosebush?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) kew gardens (B) garder (C) backyard (D) shop (E) beautiful garden", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kew Gardens\nExplanation: Kew Gardens is a famous botanical garden in London, UK, known for its vast collection of plants from all over the world. It is a popular destination for plant enthusiasts and researchers, and it is likely to have many varieties of plants, including a rosebush. The other options, such as a backyard or a shop, may have some plants, but they are unlikely to have a wide variety of species like Kew Gardens."}}
{"Q": "If I did not have a rosebush, where would I get one?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pot (B) museum (C) garden center (D) formal garden (E) backyard", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: C. garden center\nExplanation: A garden center is a place where plants, including rosebushes, are sold. It is a more plausible option than a museum or formal garden, which may not sell plants, and a backyard, which assumes the person already has a rosebush to begin with. While a pot could be used to grow a rosebush, it would still need to be purchased from a garden center or other plant retailer."}}
{"Q": "What does a person with a what likely do?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) feel important (B) trust himself (C) own house (D) electrical circuit (E) know what time", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. trust himself.\nExplanation: The question is incomplete and does not provide a clear context. However, the phrase \"a person with a what\" suggests that the missing word could be a trait or characteristic. Out of the given choices, only \"trust himself\" seems like a plausible trait that a person could have. Feeling important or owning a house are not necessarily related to a specific trait, while knowing what time is a basic skill that most people possess. The option \"electrical circuit\" is completely unrelated to the question. Therefore, option B, \"trust himself,\" is the most likely answer."}}
{"Q": "What are cats often known for?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) whiskers (B) sharp teeth (C) purr (D) four legs (E) sharp claws", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. whiskers\nExplanation: Cats are often known for their long, sensitive whiskers that help them navigate their surroundings and detect prey. While they do have sharp teeth and claws, and four legs like most animals, their whiskers are a unique and distinctive feature that sets them apart. Additionally, many cats are known for their ability to purr, but not all cats purr and it is not as universal a trait as their whiskers."}}
{"Q": "As he looked out the window, he knew the landing was happening soon, and it made him nervous, but where would he be soon?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) apartment building (B) disembark (C) stairwell (D) deplane (E) airport", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: D) deplane\n\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the landing is happening soon, which suggests that the person is on an airplane. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D) deplane, which means to exit the airplane after it has landed. The other options (apartment building, disembark, stairwell, airport) do not fit the context of being on an airplane."}}
{"Q": "Where can you find a dogs house?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) found outside (B) faithful (C) frightening (D) cold (E) four legs", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. found outside\nExplanation: A dog's house is typically found outside, in the yard or on a porch. It provides shelter and a safe place for the dog to rest and sleep. While dogs are often referred to as faithful and have four legs, these options do not directly relate to where a dog's house can be found. Frightening and cold are also not appropriate options as they do not describe a dog's house."}}
{"Q": "Tweed is a rare fabric in modern clothing, what brand should I look for when buying it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) scotland (B) brown (C) fabric store (D) clothing stores (E) eddie bauer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Scotland.\nExplanation: Tweed is a traditional fabric that originated in Scotland, so it makes sense to look for brands that specialize in producing high-quality tweed garments. Some well-known Scottish tweed brands include Harris Tweed, Lochcarron of Scotland, and Johnstons of Elgin. These brands have a long history of producing tweed fabrics and are known for their durability and unique patterns."}}
{"Q": "If you really wanted a grape, where would you go to get it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) winery (B) fruit stand (C) field (D) kitchen (E) food", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Fruit stand.\nExplanation: A fruit stand is a place where fresh fruits are sold, including grapes. Wineries produce wine from grapes, not fresh grapes. Fields may have grape vines, but they are not typically accessible to the public. The kitchen is where food is prepared, not where it is obtained. Therefore, a fruit stand is the most plausible option for obtaining a fresh grape."}}
{"Q": "What would you do to a rock when climb up a cliff?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) grab (B) look down (C) throw (D) falling (E) may fall", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. grab\nExplanation: When climbing up a cliff, it is important to have a good grip on the rocks to maintain balance and prevent falling. Therefore, grabbing onto the rocks would be the most plausible action to take. Looking down or throwing rocks could distract from the task at hand and increase the risk of falling. Falling or the possibility of falling (may fall) is not an action that one would intentionally do while climbing."}}
{"Q": "His compressor needed a new hose, where did he go?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) garden shed (B) hardware store (C) brothel (D) garage (E) greenhouse", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. hardware store.\nExplanation: A compressor is a tool used for air compression, commonly used in construction and automotive industries. A hardware store is a more plausible option for finding replacement parts for tools and machinery. The other options, such as a garden shed, brothel, greenhouse, or garage, are unlikely to have the necessary parts for a compressor hose."}}
{"Q": "The man closed his eyes as the music played, what effect did the music have?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) coma (B) enjoyable (C) soothing (D) universal (E) good or bad", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) soothing\nExplanation: The fact that the man closed his eyes while the music played suggests that he was able to relax and let go of any tension or stress he may have been feeling. This indicates that the music had a calming and soothing effect on him. Therefore, option (C) is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Setting up framing, truss and beam are some of the first steps in what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) new construction (B) warehouse (C) driving (D) ceiling (E) bridge", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Setting up framing, truss and beam are some of the first steps in new construction. These steps are essential in creating the structure of a building, which includes the walls, roof, and floors. The framing, truss, and beam work together to provide support and stability to the building. This process is typically done at the beginning of the construction process, before any other work can be done."}}
{"Q": "What is another name for a disk for storing information?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) computer store (B) computer to store data (C) computer hard drive (D) cd player (E) usb mouse", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Computer hard drive.\nExplanation: A computer hard drive is a common term used to refer to a disk for storing information in a computer. It is a non-volatile storage device that stores digital data on magnetic surfaces. Other options like \"computer store\" and \"computer to store data\" are not commonly used terms for a disk, while \"cd player\" and \"usb mouse\" are completely unrelated to storage devices."}}
