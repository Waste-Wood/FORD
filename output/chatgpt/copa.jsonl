{"Q": "The item was packaged in bubble wrap. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was fragile. (B) It was small.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was fragile.\nExplanation: Bubble wrap is commonly used to protect fragile items during shipping or transportation. The bubbles provide cushioning and absorb shock, reducing the risk of damage to the item. Therefore, it is more plausible that the item was packaged in bubble wrap because it was fragile and needed extra protection."}}
{"Q": "I emptied my pockets. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I retrieved a ticket stub. (B) I found a weapon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I retrieved a ticket stub.\nExplanation: Since the sentence states that \"I emptied my pockets,\" it implies that the action was intentional and done to search for something. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person found something they were looking for, such as a ticket stub, rather than randomly discovering a weapon in their pockets."}}
{"Q": "Termites invaded the house. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The termites disappeared from the house. (B) The termites ate through the wood in the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The termites ate through the wood in the house.\nExplanation: Termites are known for feeding on wood, and when they invade a house, they can cause significant damage by eating through the wooden structures. Therefore, it is more plausible that the termites would eat through the wood in the house rather than disappear on their own."}}
{"Q": "The travelers reached the border. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The patrol agent checked their passports. (B) The patrol agent accused them of smuggling.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The patrol agent checked their passports.\nExplanation: When travelers reach a border, it is common for patrol agents to check their passports or travel documents to verify their identity and ensure they have the necessary permissions to enter the country. Accusing them of smuggling without any evidence or suspicion would be unlikely and inappropriate. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The office was closed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was a holiday. (B) It was summer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was a holiday.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for an office to be closed is due to a holiday. It is common for offices to close on major holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and New Year's Day. On the other hand, the fact that it was summer does not necessarily mean that the office would be closed. Many businesses operate year-round regardless of the season. Therefore, option A is the more likely reason for the office being closed."}}
{"Q": "The girl ran out of energy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She played checkers. (B) She jumped rope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She jumped rope.\nExplanation: Jumping rope is a physical activity that requires a lot of energy and can quickly tire out a person. Playing checkers, on the other hand, is a sedentary activity that does not require much physical exertion. Therefore, it is more plausible that the girl ran out of energy because she jumped rope."}}
{"Q": "The woman lost her place in line. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) More people entered the line. (B) She stepped out of the line.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She stepped out of the line.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly states that the woman herself did something that caused her to lose her place in line. Option (A) suggests that other people caused her to lose her place, which is possible but not necessarily the most likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "The girl pinched her nose. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The baby drooled on her bib. (B) The baby soiled her diaper.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The baby soiled her diaper.\nExplanation: Pinching one's nose is a common reaction to a foul smell, which is likely to be caused by a soiled diaper. Drooling, on the other hand, does not typically produce a strong odor that would warrant such a reaction. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The band played their hit song. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The audience clapped along to the music. (B) The audience politely listened in silence.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The audience clapped along to the music.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the audience would react positively to the band's hit song by clapping along to the music, rather than politely listening in silence. A hit song is usually a crowd-pleaser and would elicit a more enthusiastic response from the audience."}}
{"Q": "The girl wanted to thank her math teacher. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The girl stayed after school for detention. (B) The girl brought the teacher an apple.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The girl brought the teacher an apple.\nExplanation: Bringing an apple to a teacher is a common way to show appreciation and gratitude. It is a more plausible answer than the girl staying after school for detention, which would not make sense as a result of wanting to thank her math teacher."}}
{"Q": "The young campers felt scared. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their camp counselor told them a ghost story. (B) They toasted marshmallows on the campfire.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Their camp counselor told them a ghost story.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the young campers felt scared because their camp counselor told them a ghost story, which is often associated with fear and spookiness. Toasting marshmallows on a campfire is a common and enjoyable activity that is unlikely to cause fear or anxiety."}}
{"Q": "The man hit his head. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got lost in thought. (B) He got a concussion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He got a concussion.\nExplanation: When someone hits their head, it is possible for them to suffer a concussion, which is a type of traumatic brain injury. Symptoms of a concussion can include confusion, dizziness, headache, and memory problems. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man got a concussion as a result of hitting his head. Getting lost in thought is not a typical outcome of hitting one's head."}}
{"Q": "The check I wrote bounced. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My bank account was empty. (B) I earned a pay raise.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My bank account was empty.\nExplanation: When a check bounces, it means that there were insufficient funds in the account to cover the amount of the check. This could happen if the account holder had spent more money than they had in their account, or if there were pending transactions that had not yet cleared. Option B, earning a pay raise, would not have any direct impact on the ability to cover a check."}}
{"Q": "The man's email inbox was full of spam. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He deleted the spam. (B) He sent out a mass email.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He deleted the spam.\nExplanation: It is a common practice to delete spam emails from the inbox to keep it organized and to avoid missing important emails. Sending out a mass email is not a logical solution to a full inbox of spam. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The sailor was quarantined. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was exposed to the disease. (B) He recovered from the disease.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was exposed to the disease.\nExplanation: Quarantine is a measure taken to prevent the spread of a contagious disease. If a sailor is quarantined, it means that they have been exposed to a disease and are being isolated to prevent the spread of the disease to others. Option B, that the sailor recovered from the disease, would not require quarantine as they would no longer be contagious. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl memorized the code. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She recited it to herself. (B) She forgot to write it down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She recited it to herself.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the girl memorized the code by reciting it to herself rather than forgetting to write it down. Reciting information is a common method of memorization, especially when someone needs to remember something important like a code. Forgetting to write it down would not necessarily lead to memorization, as the girl could have simply asked for the code again or found another way to access the information."}}
{"Q": "I poured the water into the glass. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The water quenched my thirst. (B) The glass became full.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The glass became full.\nExplanation: When water is poured into a glass, the most likely result is that the glass becomes full. While it is possible that the person pouring the water was thirsty and drank the water, it is not a guaranteed outcome and therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "The man remained silent when his friend finishing speaking. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wanted to offer his friend support. (B) He was thinking about his friend's words.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man remained silent because he was thinking about his friend's words. If he wanted to offer support, he would likely have said something to that effect. However, the fact that he remained silent suggests that he was processing what his friend had said and perhaps considering how to respond."}}
{"Q": "The accident was my fault. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I felt guilty. (B) I pressed charges.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I felt guilty.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person would feel guilty after causing an accident rather than pressing charges against themselves. Pressing charges would not make sense in this scenario as the person would be the one at fault. Feeling guilty is a natural emotional response to causing harm or damage to someone or something."}}
{"Q": "The chain came apart. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The chain was wrapped around a tire. (B) There was a broken link in the chain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There was a broken link in the chain.\nExplanation: A broken link in the chain is a more plausible cause for the chain coming apart than it being wrapped around a tire. If the chain was wrapped around a tire, it would likely cause the chain to become tangled or twisted, but not necessarily come apart completely. On the other hand, a broken link in the chain would cause the chain to separate and come apart."}}
{"Q": "The couple decided to compromise. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They grew tired of arguing. (B) They avoided discussing the problem.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They grew tired of arguing.\nExplanation: The word \"compromise\" implies that there was a disagreement or conflict between the couple. If they avoided discussing the problem, there would be no need for a compromise. Therefore, it is more likely that they reached a compromise because they grew tired of arguing and wanted to find a solution that would satisfy both parties."}}
{"Q": "The woman decided to run for public office. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She hired a campaign manager. (B) She testified in court.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She hired a campaign manager.\nExplanation: When someone decides to run for public office, one of the first steps they usually take is to hire a campaign manager. This person helps with fundraising, organizing events, creating a campaign strategy, and other important tasks. Testifying in court is not necessarily a typical result of running for public office, unless there is a specific legal issue related to the campaign. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man anticipated cold weather on his trip. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He packed warm clothing in his suitcase. (B) He travelled with a big suitcase.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He packed warm clothing in his suitcase.\nExplanation: Since the man anticipated cold weather on his trip, it is more plausible that he would pack warm clothing in his suitcase to prepare for the weather. Travelling with a big suitcase is not necessarily related to anticipating cold weather."}}
{"Q": "The student knew the answer to the question. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He raised his hand. (B) He goofed off.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He raised his hand.\nExplanation: When a student knows the answer to a question, the most plausible and appropriate action would be to raise their hand to indicate that they are ready to answer. This allows the teacher to call on them and gives the student the opportunity to share their knowledge with the class. Goofing off would not be a logical or appropriate response in this situation."}}
{"Q": "The man's eyes watered. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dust got into his eyes. (B) He put goggles over his eyes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Dust got into his eyes.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that dust got into his eyes, causing them to water. This is a common reaction to foreign particles entering the eyes and can cause irritation and discomfort. On the other hand, putting goggles over his eyes would not typically cause watering unless they were too tight or caused pressure on the tear ducts."}}
{"Q": "The player won five games in a row. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her opponent accused her of cheating. (B) Her opponent felt sorry for her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) The player gained confidence and felt proud of her accomplishment.\nExplanation: Winning five games in a row is a significant achievement, and it is likely that the player would feel a sense of pride and confidence in her abilities. It is not plausible that her opponent would accuse her of cheating or feel sorry for her, as winning multiple games in a row is a common occurrence in competitive games."}}
{"Q": "The teacher tore up the student's exam. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He caught the student cheating. (B) The student's answers were incorrect.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He caught the student cheating.\nExplanation: The act of tearing up an exam is a severe action that a teacher would only take if they caught a student cheating. If the student's answers were incorrect, the teacher would likely provide feedback and a grade rather than tearing up the exam. Therefore, (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I paused to stop talking. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I lost my voice. (B) I ran out of breath.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I ran out of breath.\nExplanation: Pausing to stop talking is a common occurrence when someone runs out of breath while speaking. It is unlikely that someone would pause because they lost their voice, as they would likely continue to try to speak or indicate that they were unable to speak. Running out of breath, on the other hand, is a natural and common reason for pausing while speaking."}}
{"Q": "The frozen food thawed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I put it in the microwave. (B) I covered it with plastic wrap.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I put it in the microwave.\nExplanation: When food is put in the microwave, it is heated up quickly, causing the ice crystals in frozen food to melt and turn into liquid. This is likely the cause of the frozen food thawing. On the other hand, covering the food with plastic wrap would not cause it to thaw, as it would simply help to retain moisture and prevent freezer burn."}}
{"Q": "The employee faked sick. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had stomach cramps. (B) He wanted a day off.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He wanted a day off.\nExplanation: While it is possible that the employee had stomach cramps, the fact that they \"faked sick\" suggests that they were not actually experiencing any physical symptoms. The more likely explanation is that they simply wanted a day off from work and used the excuse of being sick to justify their absence."}}
{"Q": "The girl landed in the pool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She ran on the pool deck. (B) She jumped off the diving board.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She jumped off the diving board.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the girl landed in the pool because she jumped off the diving board, as this is a common activity in a swimming pool. Running on the pool deck is dangerous and prohibited in most pools, so it is less likely that this would be the cause of her landing in the pool."}}
{"Q": "The movie tickets sold out. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was opening day for the movie. (B) The movie received poor reviews.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that it was opening day for the movie. This is because when a highly anticipated movie is released, many people rush to see it on the first day. On the other hand, if the movie received poor reviews, it is less likely that it would sell out quickly."}}
{"Q": "The man lost weight. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People isolated him. (B) People complimented him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. People complimented him.\nExplanation: Losing weight is often seen as a positive change and people tend to compliment those who have lost weight. It is unlikely that people would isolate someone for losing weight, so option A is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "The girl's hands became blistered. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She typed up a letter. (B) She climbed up a rope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She climbed up a rope.\nExplanation: Climbing up a rope requires a lot of physical effort and can cause friction between the hands and the rope, leading to blisters. Typing up a letter, on the other hand, does not typically cause blisters on the hands. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The circus performer juggled while riding a unicycle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The audience cheered in astonishment. (B) The acrobat swung from a trapeze.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The audience cheered in astonishment.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the audience would react to the impressive feat of juggling while riding a unicycle with cheers and amazement rather than the acrobat suddenly switching to swinging from a trapeze. Juggling while riding a unicycle is a difficult and impressive skill that would likely garner a positive reaction from the audience."}}
{"Q": "I lost my patience. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My friend kept me waiting. (B) My friend arrived on time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My friend kept me waiting.\nExplanation: It is more likely that losing patience was caused by waiting for someone who was late rather than someone who arrived on time. Waiting for someone who is late can be frustrating and can lead to impatience."}}
{"Q": "The warring countries wanted peace. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They developed nuclear weapons. (B) They negotiated a treaty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They negotiated a treaty.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the warring countries would negotiate a treaty to achieve peace rather than developing nuclear weapons, which would only escalate the conflict and potentially lead to catastrophic consequences. Negotiating a treaty involves diplomatic efforts to find common ground and resolve the issues that led to the conflict, which is a more peaceful and rational approach to achieving peace."}}
{"Q": "The man took sleeping medication. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He became drowsy. (B) He ran a fever.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He became drowsy.\nExplanation: Sleeping medication is designed to induce drowsiness and help a person fall asleep. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man became drowsy as a result of taking the medication rather than running a fever."}}
{"Q": "The woman bumped into the sofa. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The leg of the sofa came loose. (B) She bruised her knee.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She bruised her knee.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the woman would suffer a minor injury like a bruised knee from bumping into a sofa rather than the leg of the sofa coming loose. Sofas are typically sturdy and well-constructed, and it would take more force than a simple bump to cause damage to the sofa itself. On the other hand, it is common for people to accidentally bump into furniture and suffer minor injuries like bruises or bumps."}}
{"Q": "The boy squeezed the balloon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The balloon popped. (B) The balloon flew away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The balloon popped.\nExplanation: When a balloon is squeezed, the air inside the balloon is compressed, causing the balloon to burst or pop. Therefore, it is more plausible that the balloon popped as a result of the boy squeezing it."}}
{"Q": "They travelers checked into their hotel room. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They unpacked their suitcases. (B) They went to the airport.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) They unpacked their suitcases.\nExplanation: It is more likely that after checking into their hotel room, the travelers would unpack their suitcases and settle into their room rather than immediately going to the airport. Going to the airport would be a separate activity and not a direct result of checking into their hotel room."}}
{"Q": "I bit into the peach. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The peach bruised. (B) Juice spilled out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Juice spilled out.\nExplanation: When you bite into a peach, the pressure from your teeth breaks the skin and flesh of the fruit, causing the juice to spill out. It is more plausible than the peach bruising, which would require a significant amount of force and pressure."}}
{"Q": "My hands became sticky. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I ate a doughnut. (B) I had a sweet tooth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I ate a doughnut.\nExplanation: Doughnuts are often coated with sugar or glaze, which can make your hands sticky when you touch them. This is a common occurrence when eating doughnuts or other sweet treats. Option B, \"I had a sweet tooth,\" is not a direct cause of sticky hands and does not provide a clear explanation for why the hands became sticky."}}
{"Q": "I pushed the door. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The door opened. (B) The door locked.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The door opened.\nExplanation: When you push a door, it is designed to swing open in the direction you are pushing it. Therefore, it is more plausible that the door opened as a result of your action rather than locking."}}
{"Q": "Activists boycotted the products. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The products were tested for quality assurance. (B) The products were manufactured through child labor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The products were manufactured through child labor.\nExplanation: Activists often boycott products that are manufactured through child labor as it is considered unethical and exploitative. Testing for quality assurance is a standard practice and is unlikely to be the cause of a boycott."}}
{"Q": "I drilled a hole in the wall. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A mouse crawled out of the hole. (B) Dust blew out of the hole.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Dust blew out of the hole.\nExplanation: When drilling a hole in the wall, it is common for dust and debris to be created and blown out of the hole. It is unlikely that a mouse would crawl out of the hole unless there was already a mouse nest or hiding spot inside the wall."}}
{"Q": "The woman felt envious of her sister. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her sister was happy. (B) Her sister got divorced.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Her sister was happy.\nExplanation: Envy is a feeling of discontent or resentment towards someone because of their possessions, qualities, or achievements. In this case, the cause of the woman's envy is her sister's happiness, which suggests that the woman is not happy herself. It is unlikely that her sister's divorce would be the cause of her envy, as divorce is generally not seen as a desirable outcome."}}
{"Q": "I spilled wine on my shirt. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I put on an apron. (B) I changed my shirt.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I changed my shirt.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that someone would change their shirt after spilling wine on it rather than putting on an apron, which is typically used to prevent spills while cooking or working with messy materials. Changing the shirt would be a more effective solution to remove the stain and avoid further embarrassment or discomfort."}}
{"Q": "The cashier opened the cash register. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The customer searched his wallet. (B) The customer handed her money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The customer handed her money.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for a cashier to open the cash register is to receive payment from a customer. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of the cashier opening the cash register. Option A, where the customer searches his wallet, does not necessarily require the cashier to open the cash register."}}
{"Q": "The street musician attracted a crowd. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People gave him change. (B) He sent the crowd away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. People gave him change.\nExplanation: It is common for street musicians to receive tips or change from the crowd that gathers around them. Therefore, it is more plausible that people gave him change rather than him sending the crowd away."}}
{"Q": "The little boy cried to his babysitter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He missed his parents. (B) It was snack time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He missed his parents.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a little boy would cry because he misses his parents rather than because it is snack time. Separation anxiety is common in young children, especially when they are left with a new caregiver. Crying is a common way for children to express their emotions and seek comfort when they are feeling upset or scared. Therefore, it is more plausible that the little boy cried because he missed his parents."}}
{"Q": "The pilot's radar detected a storm. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The pilot navigated away from the storm. (B) The pilot flew through the storm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The pilot navigated away from the storm.\nExplanation: It is common practice for pilots to avoid flying through storms as they can be dangerous and cause turbulence. Therefore, it is more plausible that the pilot would navigate away from the storm to ensure the safety of the passengers and crew on board."}}
{"Q": "The tree shed its leaves. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The leaves turned colors. (B) The leaves accumulated on the ground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The leaves accumulated on the ground.\nExplanation: When a tree sheds its leaves, the leaves fall off and accumulate on the ground. This is a natural process that happens during the autumn season when trees prepare for winter. The leaves do turn colors before falling off, but that is not the direct result of the tree shedding its leaves. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy was in a mischievous mood. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided to play a card game with his sister. (B) He decided to play a practical joke on his sister.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He decided to play a practical joke on his sister.\nExplanation: Since the boy was in a mischievous mood, it is more likely that he would choose to play a prank on his sister rather than play a card game with her. Playing a practical joke is a common behavior associated with mischievousness, while playing a card game is not necessarily related to mischievousness."}}
{"Q": "The child complained that he had to go to the bathroom. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His father gave him a soda to drink. (B) His father stopped the car at a gas station.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His father stopped the car at a gas station.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the father would stop at a gas station to allow the child to use the bathroom rather than giving him a soda to drink, which would only make the situation worse. Stopping at a gas station would provide a suitable location for the child to use the restroom."}}
{"Q": "The child sprinkled fish food into the tank. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fish leapt out of the tank. (B) The fish swam towards the food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The fish swam towards the food.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the fish would be attracted to the food and swim towards it, rather than leaping out of the tank. Fish are known to have a strong sense of smell and are able to detect food in the water, so it is natural for them to swim towards it when it is added to their tank."}}
{"Q": "The woman's political views changed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She switched her party affiliation. (B) She engaged in a protest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She switched her party affiliation.\nExplanation: If the woman's political views changed, it is more likely that she would switch her party affiliation to align with her new beliefs rather than immediately engaging in a protest. Switching party affiliation is a common response to a change in political views and allows the individual to have a more significant impact on the political process."}}
{"Q": "The bathroom sink was clogged. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I turned on the faucet. (B) I poured drain cleaner into it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I poured drain cleaner into it.\nExplanation: If the bathroom sink was clogged, turning on the faucet would not have solved the problem and may have even made it worse by causing the water to overflow. Pouring drain cleaner into the sink is a more plausible solution as it can dissolve the blockage and allow the water to flow freely again."}}
{"Q": "The passengers got off the train. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The train arrived at the station. (B) The train blared its whistle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The train arrived at the station.\nExplanation: When a train arrives at a station, it is common for passengers to get off the train. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the passengers getting off the train was the train arriving at the station rather than the train blaring its whistle."}}
{"Q": "The man pressed down on the moist flap of the envelope. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He put a stamp on the envelope. (B) He sealed the envelope shut.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He sealed the envelope shut.\n\nExplanation: Pressing down on the moist flap of an envelope is a common way to seal it shut. This action activates the adhesive on the flap, causing it to stick to the rest of the envelope and keep its contents secure. Putting a stamp on the envelope is a separate action that does not necessarily require pressing down on the flap. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The friends lost touch. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They enjoyed each other's company. (B) They moved to different cities.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They moved to different cities.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the friends lost touch because they moved to different cities. When people move away, it can be difficult to maintain regular contact and keep up with each other's lives. While enjoying each other's company is important for maintaining a friendship, it is not necessarily a cause for losing touch."}}
{"Q": "The accountant mismanaged the company's funds. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was fired from her position. (B) She went on maternity leave.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was fired from her position.\nExplanation: Mismanaging company funds is a serious offense and can lead to financial losses for the company. Therefore, it is likely that the accountant would be held accountable for her actions and face consequences such as termination of employment. Maternity leave is not a relevant consequence in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "I looked at the clock. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I heard the clock tick. (B) I wanted to check the time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I wanted to check the time.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for someone to look at a clock is to check the time. While hearing the clock tick may draw someone's attention to it, it is not necessarily the cause for them to look at it. Therefore, option (B) is a more likely reason for someone to look at a clock."}}
{"Q": "My hand cramped up. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wrote the essay by hand. (B) My wife and I held hands.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I wrote the essay by hand.\nExplanation: Writing by hand for an extended period of time can cause hand cramps due to the repetitive motion and strain on the muscles in the hand. Holding hands with someone would not typically cause hand cramps unless there was an unusual amount of pressure or tension involved."}}
{"Q": "The bolt tightened. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I replaced the bolt. (B) I twisted the wrench.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I twisted the wrench.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the bolt tightening is that someone applied force to it with a wrench, which would be twisting the wrench. Option (A) suggests that the bolt was replaced, but replacing a bolt does not necessarily mean it would automatically tighten. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The couple signed a lease for an apartment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The couple moved into the apartment. (B) The city condemned the apartment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The couple moved into the apartment.\nExplanation: Signing a lease typically means that the couple has agreed to rent the apartment and will move in as tenants. Option B, where the city condemns the apartment, is not a likely outcome of signing a lease unless there were pre-existing issues with the apartment that were not disclosed before signing the lease."}}
{"Q": "The woman sat outside on the porch. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She wanted to watch the sunset. (B) She thought she saw lightning.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She wanted to watch the sunset.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because sitting outside on the porch to watch the sunset is a common and enjoyable activity. On the other hand, thinking she saw lightning would likely cause her to seek shelter indoors rather than sit outside on the porch."}}
{"Q": "The man wore a lifejacket in the water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He couldn't swim. (B) The water was shallow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He couldn't swim.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man wore a lifejacket in the water because he couldn't swim. A lifejacket is a flotation device that helps keep a person afloat in the water, and it is commonly used by non-swimmers or weak swimmers to prevent drowning. If the water was shallow, there would be no need for a lifejacket as the person could simply stand up or walk out of the water. Therefore, option (B) is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman made a typo in the word processor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She deleted the document. (B) She hit the backspace key.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She hit the backspace key.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the woman would simply hit the backspace key to correct the typo rather than deleting the entire document. Deleting the document would be an extreme and unnecessary action for a simple typo."}}
{"Q": "The girl bragged to her friends. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She got a bad grade. (B) She won a contest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She won a contest.\nExplanation: Winning a contest is a common reason for someone to brag to their friends. It is a positive achievement that they are proud of and want to share with others. Getting a bad grade, on the other hand, is not typically something someone would brag about."}}
{"Q": "The lawn was muddy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It poured overnight. (B) It was full of weeds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It poured overnight.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of a muddy lawn is heavy rainfall, which would make the soil saturated and muddy. Weeds would not necessarily cause a lawn to be muddy."}}
{"Q": "The woman overslept. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She stayed the night in a hotel. (B) She forgot to set her alarm clock.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She forgot to set her alarm clock.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because oversleeping due to forgetting to set an alarm is a common occurrence. Staying in a hotel may also cause oversleeping, but it is not necessarily the most likely cause in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "The man put on sunscreen. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He sat in the shade. (B) He went to the beach.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that he went to the beach. Sunscreen is typically used to protect the skin from the harmful effects of the sun's UV rays, which are more intense at the beach due to the reflection of the sun off the water and sand. Sitting in the shade may provide some protection from the sun, but it is unlikely that someone would apply sunscreen solely for that reason."}}
{"Q": "The researchers proved the theory. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researchers retracted the theory. (B) Individuals accepted the theory.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Individuals accepted the theory.\nExplanation: If the researchers proved the theory, it means that they provided evidence or data to support it. Therefore, it is more likely that individuals would accept the theory rather than the researchers retracting it."}}
{"Q": "The fans at the game booed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The game went into overtime. (B) The referee made a bad call.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The referee made a bad call.\nExplanation: The fans booing at a game is a common reaction when they feel that the referee has made a bad call. It is unlikely that the game going into overtime would cause such a negative reaction from the fans. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I entered my combination on the lock. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I shut the lock. (B) The lock popped open.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The lock popped open.\nExplanation: When the correct combination is entered on a combination lock, the lock mechanism is released and the lock can be opened. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lock would pop open rather than simply shutting after entering the combination."}}
{"Q": "The crowd intensified. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The father handed his son some money. (B) The father grabbed his son's hand.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The father grabbed his son's hand.\nExplanation: As the crowd intensified, it is likely that the father would want to ensure the safety of his son by holding his hand and keeping him close. Hand-holding is a common way for parents to protect their children in crowded or potentially dangerous situations. On the other hand, there is no clear connection between the crowd intensifying and the father handing his son some money."}}
{"Q": "The snow was blocking the driveway. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I gathered the snow into a snowball. (B) I shoveled the snow out of the way.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I shoveled the snow out of the way.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the person would need to clear the snow from the driveway in order to be able to use it, rather than gathering the snow into a snowball. Shoveling the snow out of the way would be the most practical solution to the problem."}}
{"Q": "The kayakers paddled their oars. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The kayak reached the shore. (B) The kayak hit a wave.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The kayak moved forward.\nExplanation: When the kayakers paddled their oars, the kayak would have moved forward in the water. Neither option A nor B necessarily follows from the given sentence, as there is no information about the proximity of the shore or the presence of waves."}}
{"Q": "The girl lost control of her bike. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She let go of the handlebars. (B) She crashed into a fence.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She crashed into a fence.\nExplanation: If the girl lost control of her bike, it is more likely that she would crash into something rather than simply letting go of the handlebars. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I turned on the fan. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Water sprinkled onto my skin. (B) I felt cool air pass over me.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I felt cool air pass over me.\nExplanation: When a fan is turned on, it circulates the air in the room, creating a breeze that can make us feel cooler. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person would feel cool air passing over them rather than water sprinkling onto their skin."}}
{"Q": "The surfers returned to the beach. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They were drenched. (B) They saw a shark.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They saw a shark.\nExplanation: Seeing a shark is a more plausible reason for surfers to return to the beach as it poses a potential threat to their safety. Being drenched is a common occurrence while surfing and would not necessarily cause them to abruptly end their session."}}
{"Q": "I pulled the drain plug in the bathtub. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The water drained out of the tub. (B) The water splashed onto the floor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The water drained out of the tub.\nExplanation: When the drain plug is pulled in the bathtub, it creates an opening for the water to flow out of the tub and into the drain. This is the intended function of the drain plug, and it is unlikely that the water would splash onto the floor unless there was a blockage in the drain or some other issue with the plumbing. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The husband felt guilty about cheating on his wife. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He accused her of infidelity. (B) He confessed his infidelity to her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He confessed his infidelity to her.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the husband would confess his infidelity to his wife as a result of feeling guilty. Accusing her of infidelity would not alleviate his guilt and would only create more problems in their relationship. Confessing his infidelity would allow for honesty and potentially lead to the couple working through their issues together."}}
{"Q": "The ink on the poster smeared. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I waited for the ink to dry. (B) I spilled water on the poster.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I spilled water on the poster.\nExplanation: Water can cause ink to smear, especially if the ink has not fully dried. Waiting for the ink to dry (option A) would not cause the ink to smear unless there was some other external factor, such as humidity or moisture in the air. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The child woke up screaming. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He had a nightmare. (B) He wet the bed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He had a nightmare.\nExplanation: Waking up screaming is a common symptom of having a nightmare. On the other hand, wetting the bed may cause discomfort or embarrassment, but it is less likely to cause a sudden outburst of fear or distress. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy put his feet up on the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His father sat down at the table. (B) His father lectured him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His father lectured him.\nExplanation: Putting one's feet up on the table is generally considered impolite and disrespectful behavior, especially in a formal setting like a dining table. Therefore, it is more likely that the boy's father would lecture him about proper table manners rather than sit down at the table and ignore the behavior."}}
{"Q": "My friend turned his head in my direction. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I shouted his name. (B) I waved my arms.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the friend turned their head in response to hearing their name being shouted, rather than someone waving their arms. Hearing one's name being called is a common trigger for turning one's head towards the direction of the sound."}}
{"Q": "The government oppressed its citizens. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The citizens staged a revolt. (B) The citizens registered to vote.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The citizens staged a revolt.\nExplanation: When a government oppresses its citizens, it often leads to frustration, anger, and a desire for change. In extreme cases, citizens may resort to staging a revolt or rebellion to overthrow the oppressive government and establish a new system. Registering to vote may be a peaceful way to bring about change, but it is unlikely to be the first response to oppression."}}
{"Q": "The boy was lost in the woods. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He pitched a tent. (B) He screamed for help.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He screamed for help.\nExplanation: When someone is lost in the woods, the first thing they should do is try to find their way back or call for help. Pitching a tent would not be a priority in this situation as it does not address the immediate need for assistance. Therefore, screaming for help is the most plausible answer as it increases the chances of being heard by someone who can provide assistance."}}
{"Q": "The woman travelled abroad. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She wanted to learn how to draw. (B) She wanted to learn about other cultures.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She wanted to learn about other cultures.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because travelling abroad is a common way to experience and learn about different cultures. Learning how to draw could be done locally and does not necessarily require travelling abroad."}}
{"Q": "The man was jealous of his coworker. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His coworker got a promotion. (B) His coworker worked late.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His coworker got a promotion.\nExplanation: The fact that the coworker got a promotion suggests that he was doing well at work and was recognized for his efforts. This could have made the man feel inadequate or overlooked, leading to feelings of jealousy. Working late alone does not necessarily indicate success or recognition, so it is less likely to be the cause of the man's jealousy."}}
{"Q": "The man witnessed aliens. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was hallucinating. (B) He was meditating.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was hallucinating.\nExplanation: While it is possible that someone may have a spiritual experience during meditation, witnessing aliens is not a common occurrence. On the other hand, hallucinations can be caused by various factors such as drug use, mental illness, or even sleep deprivation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man was hallucinating rather than meditating."}}
{"Q": "The man's hair turned blonde. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He put bleach in it. (B) He put shampoo in it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He put bleach in it.\nExplanation: Bleach is a common chemical used to lighten hair color. Shampoo, on the other hand, is not known to change hair color in such a drastic way. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man's hair turned blonde because he put bleach in it."}}
{"Q": "The artist created new work. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She critiqued her previous work. (B) She felt a stroke of inspiration.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the artist created new work due to a stroke of inspiration rather than critiquing her previous work. While artists may critique their work to improve upon it, it is not always the sole reason for creating new pieces. Inspiration can come from a variety of sources and can lead to new and exciting creations."}}
{"Q": "The son moved away from home. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was discharged from the military. (B) He was going to college.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was going to college.\nExplanation: Going to college is a common reason for young adults to move away from home. Being discharged from the military may also cause someone to move away, but it is less common and not mentioned in the question as a reason."}}
{"Q": "Books fell out of the bookcase. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The shelves were covered with dust. (B) An earthquake shook the bookcase.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: An earthquake shaking the bookcase is a more plausible explanation for books falling out of the bookcase than the shelves being covered with dust. Dust on the shelves would not cause the books to fall out unless the dust was so thick that it caused the shelves to collapse, which is unlikely. On the other hand, an earthquake can cause objects to shake and fall off of surfaces, including books falling out of a bookcase."}}
{"Q": "The electricity in my house shut off. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I turned on a light. (B) I reset the circuit breaker.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I reset the circuit breaker.\nExplanation: If the electricity in the house shut off, it is likely that a circuit breaker tripped. Resetting the circuit breaker would restore power to the house. Turning on a light would not be possible if there is no electricity."}}
{"Q": "We rode the roller coaster. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It looked scary. (B) It looked fun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It looked fun.\nExplanation: The reason for riding the roller coaster was most likely because it looked fun. Roller coasters are designed to provide an exciting and thrilling experience, and many people enjoy the adrenaline rush that comes with riding them. While some people may find roller coasters scary, the fact that the person in the question rode it suggests that they found it appealing and enjoyable."}}
{"Q": "The bag of popcorn began to pop. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I poured butter into the bag. (B) I heated it in the microwave.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the bag of popcorn began to pop because it was heated in the microwave. Popcorn kernels pop when they are exposed to heat, and microwaving is a common method of cooking popcorn. Pouring butter into the bag would not cause the popcorn to pop, but rather would be added as a topping after the popcorn is popped."}}
{"Q": "A tree fell on the power line. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The electricity in the neighborhood went out. (B) The forecast predicted heavy winds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The electricity in the neighborhood went out.\nExplanation: When a tree falls on a power line, it can cause a power outage in the surrounding area. The weight of the tree can damage the power line, causing it to break or disconnect from the power source. As a result, the flow of electricity is interrupted, and the neighborhood experiences a power outage until the power company can repair the damage. Option B, forecasting heavy winds, is not a direct result of a tree falling on a power line."}}
{"Q": "The speaker made politically incorrect comments. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bored the audience. (B) He offended the audience.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He offended the audience.\nExplanation: Making politically incorrect comments can often be seen as insensitive or offensive to certain groups of people. Therefore, it is more likely that the audience would be offended rather than bored by such comments."}}
{"Q": "I pricked myself with the pin. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A bead of sweat dripped from my face. (B) A drop of blood formed on my finger.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. A drop of blood formed on my finger.\nExplanation: When someone pricks themselves with a pin, it is likely that a small wound is created, causing a drop of blood to form on the finger. Sweating is not a typical response to a pin prick, making option A less plausible."}}
{"Q": "The fish floated on the surface of the tank. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was hungry. (B) It was dead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the fish was dead. When fish die, they often float to the surface of the water due to the gases that build up in their body. Hunger would not cause a fish to float on the surface."}}
{"Q": "The man's voice sounded hoarse. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He had a cold. (B) He quit smoking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He had a cold.\nExplanation: A hoarse voice is a common symptom of a cold or upper respiratory infection. Smoking cessation may also cause a hoarse voice, but it is less likely to be the cause in this scenario as it is not mentioned that the man was a smoker or had recently quit smoking. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The elevator doors opened. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The elevator arrived at the designated floor. (B) The elevator got stuck between floors.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The elevator arrived at the designated floor.\nExplanation: When the elevator arrives at the designated floor, the doors automatically open to allow passengers to enter or exit. On the other hand, if the elevator gets stuck between floors, the doors may not open, and passengers may need to be rescued by maintenance personnel. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The teenager snuck out of the house. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He lied to his parents. (B) His parents grounded him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He lied to his parents.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for a teenager to sneak out of the house is because they want to do something that their parents have forbidden them from doing. If the parents had grounded the teenager, it would make more sense for them to stay in the house and serve their punishment. However, if the teenager lied to their parents about where they were going or what they were doing, they may feel the need to sneak out to avoid getting caught in their lie."}}
{"Q": "The bathroom flooded. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The toilet overflowed. (B) The water heater broke.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The toilet overflowed.\nExplanation: The toilet overflowing is a more plausible cause of a bathroom flood than the water heater breaking. Toilets can overflow due to clogs, flushing inappropriate items, or a malfunctioning valve. Water heaters breaking can cause leaks, but it is less likely to result in a flood in the bathroom specifically."}}
{"Q": "The puppy stayed near its owner. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The owner put a collar on the puppy. (B) The owner kept the puppy on a leash.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The owner kept the puppy on a leash.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the owner kept the puppy on a leash. This is because a leash is a common tool used to keep a puppy close to its owner and prevent it from running away or getting into trouble. While a collar may also be used, it does not necessarily keep the puppy close to the owner. Therefore, it is more likely that the puppy stayed near its owner because it was on a leash."}}
{"Q": "The man caught his reflection. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He stood under the sprawling tree. (B) He stood over the calm lake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He stood over the calm lake.\nExplanation: When standing over a calm lake, the surface of the water acts as a mirror, reflecting the image of anything above it. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man caught his reflection while standing over the calm lake rather than standing under a sprawling tree."}}
{"Q": "I missed my girlfriend's phone call. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I called her back. (B) I met her for dinner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I called her back.\nExplanation: It is more likely that if you missed your girlfriend's phone call, you would call her back to see what she wanted or to apologize for missing the call. Meeting her for dinner seems like a less likely outcome, as it would require more planning and coordination."}}
{"Q": "The family searched the neighborhood. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their dog ran away from home. (B) Expensive jewelry was missing from their home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Their dog ran away from home.\nExplanation: The fact that the family searched the neighborhood suggests that they were looking for something that had gone missing. However, the missing item is not specified in the sentence. Given that the sentence mentions \"their dog,\" it is more likely that the family was searching for their lost pet rather than expensive jewelry. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I saw my breath when I exhaled. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather was chilly. (B) My chest felt tight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The weather was chilly.\nExplanation: When the temperature drops, the air becomes colder and can no longer hold as much moisture. As a result, the water vapor in our breath condenses into visible droplets, which we can see as mist or fog. This is why we can see our breath on a cold day, especially when the air is dry. On the other hand, if our chest feels tight, it may be a symptom of asthma or other respiratory conditions, but it is not directly related to the visibility of our breath."}}
{"Q": "The employees formed a union. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They wanted better working conditions. (B) Their employer raised their wages.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They wanted better working conditions.\nExplanation: The formation of a union by employees is usually a response to poor working conditions, low wages, lack of benefits, or other grievances against their employer. While a wage increase may be a factor in their decision to unionize, it is more likely that the employees were seeking better working conditions overall."}}
{"Q": "I baked an apple pie. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A rotting smell filled the kitchen. (B) A warm aroma filled the kitchen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. A warm aroma filled the kitchen.\nExplanation: When an apple pie is baked, it releases a warm and sweet aroma due to the combination of cinnamon, sugar, and baked apples. This is a common and expected result of baking an apple pie. Option A, a rotting smell, is not a plausible result as an apple pie is made with fresh apples and does not contain any ingredients that would cause a rotting smell."}}
{"Q": "The woman struggled to walk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She wore high heels. (B) She took off her shoes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She wore high heels.\nExplanation: High heels can cause discomfort and pain in the feet, ankles, and legs, making it difficult to walk. The woman's struggle to walk is likely due to the discomfort caused by the high heels she was wearing. On the other hand, taking off her shoes would likely provide relief and make it easier for her to walk."}}
{"Q": "Steam rose off of the pot of water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The water boiled. (B) I covered the pot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The water boiled.\nExplanation: When water reaches its boiling point, it turns into steam and rises off the surface of the water. This is a natural process that occurs when heat is applied to water, causing the molecules to move faster and eventually turn into gas. Covering the pot may cause the steam to condense and fall back into the water, but it does not cause the steam to rise in the first place. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "All my socks were in the laundry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wore sandals. (B) I wore boots.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I wore sandals.\nExplanation: If all the socks were in the laundry, it is more likely that the person would choose to wear sandals rather than boots, as sandals do not require socks. Additionally, if it was warm weather, sandals would be a more comfortable and practical choice."}}
{"Q": "The politician's argument was considered absurd. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He lost the support of voters. (B) He was accused of corruption.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He lost the support of voters.\nExplanation: When a politician's argument is considered absurd, it is likely that voters will lose confidence in their ability to make sound decisions and represent their interests. This can lead to a loss of support and ultimately affect their chances of winning an election. On the other hand, being accused of corruption is a separate issue that may or may not be related to the politician's argument being considered absurd."}}
{"Q": "Everyone disapproved of the couple's engagement. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The couple got pregnant. (B) The couple eloped.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The couple eloped.\nExplanation: Since everyone disapproved of their engagement, it is likely that the couple faced opposition from their families and friends. In such a situation, eloping is a more plausible option than getting pregnant, which would only add to their problems. Eloping would allow the couple to get married without the approval of their families and avoid any potential conflicts."}}
{"Q": "The building was dedicated to the millionaire. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The millionaire wanted the building torn down. (B) The millionaire contributed the funds to build it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The millionaire contributed the funds to build it.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the building was dedicated to the millionaire because they contributed the funds to build it. It is common for wealthy individuals to donate money to fund the construction of buildings, and in return, the building may be named after them or dedicated to them as a sign of gratitude. It is unlikely that the millionaire would want the building torn down if they had contributed funds to build it."}}
{"Q": "The sale associate accused the girl of stealing. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sales associate saw the girl put merchandise in her purse. (B) The sales associate helped the girl find the purse she liked.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: The cause of the sales associate accusing the girl of stealing was that the sales associate saw the girl put merchandise in her purse. This suggests that the sales associate had evidence or reason to believe that the girl was stealing, rather than simply making an unfounded accusation."}}
{"Q": "The country declared war on the neighboring territory. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Soldiers were sent out to fight. (B) Soldiers were reunited with their families.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Soldiers were sent out to fight.\nExplanation: When a country declares war on another territory, it usually means that military action will be taken. In this case, soldiers would be sent out to fight in the war. It is unlikely that soldiers would be reunited with their families during a time of war, as they would be needed for combat."}}
{"Q": "The court upheld the controversial ruling. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A riot broke loose in front of the courthouse. (B) A couple exchanged vows in front of the courthouse.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A riot broke loose in front of the courthouse.\nExplanation: The use of the word \"controversial\" suggests that the ruling was likely to have been divisive and could have sparked strong reactions from those who disagreed with it. Therefore, it is more plausible that a riot would break out in response to the ruling rather than a couple exchanging vows."}}
{"Q": "The girl smelled something burning. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She took the cookies out of the jar. (B) She left the cookies in the oven.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She left the cookies in the oven.\nExplanation: If the girl smelled something burning, it is more likely that she left the cookies in the oven for too long and they burned, rather than simply taking them out of the jar."}}
{"Q": "The rain was pouring down. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The storm worsened. (B) I dashed to get inside.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I dashed to get inside.\nExplanation: When it is raining heavily, it is natural for people to seek shelter. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person in the sentence would try to get inside to avoid getting wet rather than the storm worsening."}}
{"Q": "The building was evacuated. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The elevator stopped functioning. (B) The fire alarm went off.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The fire alarm went off.\nExplanation: If a building is evacuated, it is most likely due to a fire alarm going off. This is a safety measure to ensure that everyone in the building is safe and accounted for in case of a fire. While an elevator malfunction could also lead to an evacuation, it is less common and would not be the first assumption."}}
{"Q": "The father resented his son's alcoholism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The father bought his son a beer. (B) The father kicked his son out of the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The father kicked his son out of the house.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the father would take a tough love approach and not enable his son's addiction by buying him alcohol. Kicking his son out of the house may be a consequence of the father's frustration and disappointment with his son's behavior. It could also be a way to protect the rest of the family from the negative effects of the son's alcoholism."}}
{"Q": "The lawyer took the stairs up to her office. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The secretary went home for the day. (B) The elevator was out of order.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The elevator was out of order.\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer because if the secretary went home for the day, it wouldn't necessarily mean that the lawyer couldn't use the elevator. However, if the elevator was out of order, then the lawyer would have no choice but to take the stairs up to her office."}}
{"Q": "The man became annoyed with his friend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His friend interrupted him. (B) His friend bought him lunch.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) His friend interrupted him.\nExplanation: Interruptions can be frustrating and disruptive to a conversation or activity. It is a more plausible reason for someone to become annoyed with their friend compared to their friend buying them lunch, which is typically seen as a kind gesture."}}
{"Q": "The girl handed her money to the cashier. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cashier gave the girl her change. (B) The cashier forgot to give the girl a receipt.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The cashier gave the girl her change.\nExplanation: It is common practice for cashiers to give customers their change after receiving payment. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cashier gave the girl her change rather than forgetting to give her a receipt."}}
{"Q": "The woman was put in a wheelchair. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was paralyzed in an accident. (B) She entered the hospital in a stretcher.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was paralyzed in an accident.\nExplanation: The most likely reason for someone to be put in a wheelchair is if they are unable to walk due to a physical disability or injury. Option A suggests that the woman was paralyzed in an accident, which would result in her needing a wheelchair for mobility. Option B, on the other hand, only suggests that she was brought to the hospital on a stretcher, which does not necessarily mean she would need a wheelchair afterwards."}}
{"Q": "Citizens hung the national flag up outside their homes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The country was commemorating its independence. (B) The country was facing economic hardship.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The country was commemorating its independence.\nExplanation: Hanging the national flag outside homes is a common way of showing patriotism and pride in one's country, especially during national holidays or events. Commemorating independence is a significant event for any country, and citizens often display their national flag to celebrate their freedom and sovereignty. On the other hand, economic hardship is unlikely to be the cause of citizens hanging the national flag outside their homes. While economic hardship may lead to protests or demonstrations, it is not directly related to displaying the national flag."}}
{"Q": "The team lost the tournament. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They disappointed their fans. (B) They inspired their fans.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They disappointed their fans.\nExplanation: Losing a tournament is generally seen as a negative outcome, especially for fans who were hoping for a win. The team's loss would likely lead to disappointment among their supporters, rather than inspiration."}}
{"Q": "My friend pointed out that I had food stuck in my teeth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I felt embarrassed. (B) I felt proud.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I felt embarrassed.\nExplanation: It is a common social norm to maintain good oral hygiene and appearance in public. Having food stuck in teeth can be embarrassing and may lead to social discomfort. Therefore, feeling embarrassed is a more plausible reaction in this situation. Feeling proud would not be a logical response as having food stuck in teeth is not something to be proud of."}}
{"Q": "The boy failed his history exam. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He paid attention in class. (B) He forgot to study.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He forgot to study.\nExplanation: If the boy failed his history exam, it is more plausible that he did not study enough or at all, rather than paying attention in class. Paying attention in class is important, but it does not guarantee success on an exam if the student does not review and study the material. Forgetting to study is a common reason for failing an exam."}}
{"Q": "The downtown building collapsed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An earthquake hit the city. (B) Crime rates in the city increased.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. An earthquake hit the city.\nExplanation: The collapse of a building is more likely to be caused by a natural disaster such as an earthquake rather than an increase in crime rates. Crime rates may lead to other issues in a city, but they are not directly related to the structural integrity of a building."}}
{"Q": "The man's girlfriend broke up with him. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He begged her to take him back. (B) She introduced him to her parents.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man would try to win his girlfriend back by begging her to take him back after a breakup rather than her introducing him to her parents. Introducing someone to parents is usually a sign of a serious and committed relationship, which is unlikely to happen after a breakup."}}
{"Q": "The two children simultaneously reached down to retrieve the ball. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The ball rolled away. (B) Their heads collided.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The ball rolled away.\nExplanation: Since both children reached down to retrieve the ball at the same time, it is more likely that the ball would roll away from them rather than their heads colliding. This is because their hands would have pushed the ball in opposite directions, causing it to move away from them."}}
{"Q": "The raccoon ransacked the garbage can. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was cardboard in the garbage can. (B) The lid was off the garbage can.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The lid was off the garbage can.\nExplanation: Raccoons are known for their scavenging behavior and are attracted to garbage cans. If the lid is off the garbage can, it is easier for the raccoon to access the contents inside and therefore more likely to ransack it. While cardboard may also be an attractant for raccoons, it is not as significant a factor as the accessibility of the garbage can."}}
{"Q": "The boy sharpened the pencil. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was cheap. (B) It was dull.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It was dull.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the pencil was dull, which is a common reason for sharpening a pencil. If the pencil was cheap, it wouldn't necessarily need to be sharpened, and if it was already sharp, there would be no need to sharpen it. Therefore, the most likely cause of the boy sharpening the pencil is that it was dull and needed to be sharpened."}}
{"Q": "The cashier denied the woman a refund for the dress. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She lost her receipt. (B) The dress didn't fit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) She lost her receipt.\nExplanation: Without a receipt, it is difficult for the cashier to verify the purchase and ensure that the dress was not worn or damaged before the woman attempted to return it. Many stores have strict policies regarding returns without a receipt, and it is common for cashiers to deny refunds in these situations. On the other hand, if the dress didn't fit, the woman may have been able to exchange it for a different size or style, or receive store credit."}}
{"Q": "The scratch in my skin was deep. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It healed quickly. (B) It left a scar.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It left a scar.\nExplanation: When a scratch is deep, it can damage the deeper layers of the skin, including the dermis. The dermis contains collagen fibers that give the skin its strength and elasticity. When these fibers are damaged, the body produces scar tissue to repair the area. Scar tissue is not as flexible as normal skin and can appear as a visible mark on the skin's surface. Therefore, it is more plausible that a deep scratch would leave a scar rather than heal quickly without any visible mark."}}
{"Q": "The man received strange looks from passengers on the train. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was staring at the ground. (B) He was talking to himself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was talking to himself.\nExplanation: People often give strange looks to someone who appears to be talking to themselves in public. This behavior is considered unusual and may make others uncomfortable or concerned. On the other hand, staring at the ground is a common behavior and is unlikely to attract much attention or cause people to give strange looks. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The child left crumbs on the floor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ants crawled to the crumbs. (B) The child put the bread away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ants crawled to the crumbs.\nExplanation: It is more likely that leaving crumbs on the floor would attract ants, rather than the child putting the bread away. Ants are known to be attracted to food crumbs and would likely come to the area to feed on them."}}
{"Q": "The woman handed her sister a tissue. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The woman's sister folded her hands. (B) The woman's sister began to cry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The woman's sister began to cry.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the woman's sister began to cry, which prompted the woman to hand her a tissue. This is a common gesture of offering comfort and support to someone who is upset or emotional. The fact that the woman handed her sister a tissue suggests that she noticed her sister's tears and wanted to help her feel better. On the other hand, the option (A) that the woman's sister folded her hands does not provide any context or reason for the woman to hand her a tissue."}}
{"Q": "The man took a mint. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His lips were chapped. (B) He worried about bad breath.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He worried about bad breath.\nExplanation: Taking a mint is a common solution for freshening one's breath. It is more plausible that the man took a mint because he was concerned about having bad breath rather than his lips being chapped, which would not necessarily be alleviated by taking a mint."}}
{"Q": "The couple left early for the show. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They anticipated traffic around the theatre. (B) They got directions to the theatre.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They anticipated traffic around the theatre.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the couple left early to avoid traffic around the theatre, as this is a common reason for leaving early to attend a show or event. Getting directions to the theatre would not necessarily require leaving early, as they could have done this beforehand or used GPS to navigate."}}
{"Q": "The woman stayed home from work. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her boss praised her. (B) Her coworker covered for her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Her coworker covered for her.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that if the woman stayed home from work, her coworker would cover for her rather than her boss praising her. It is common for coworkers to help each other out in the workplace, especially if someone is absent."}}
{"Q": "The man signed the activists' petition. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He supported their cause. (B) He denounced them as crazy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He supported their cause.\nExplanation: The fact that the man signed the activists' petition suggests that he is in favor of their cause and wants to support it. If he denounced them as crazy, he would not have signed the petition. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The actor's heart was fluttering before his performance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He had stage fright. (B) He memorized his lines.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He had stage fright.\nExplanation: Stage fright is a common phenomenon experienced by actors before a performance. It is characterized by symptoms such as increased heart rate, sweating, and nervousness. Memorizing lines, on the other hand, is a normal part of an actor's preparation and is unlikely to cause physical symptoms such as a fluttering heart. Therefore, it is more plausible that the actor's heart was fluttering due to stage fright."}}
{"Q": "I was lost. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I counted my cash. (B) I unfolded a map.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I unfolded a map.\nExplanation: If someone is lost, it is more plausible that they would try to find their way by using a map rather than counting their cash. Counting cash would not help them find their way or determine their location. Unfolding a map, on the other hand, would provide them with a visual representation of their surroundings and help them navigate to their desired destination."}}
{"Q": "The ripe fruit lingered in the sun. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was eaten. (B) It shriveled up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It shriveled up.\nExplanation: When ripe fruit is left in the sun for too long, it can become dehydrated and lose moisture, causing it to shrivel up and become unappetizing. This is a common occurrence with fruits like grapes, berries, and tomatoes that are left out in the sun for too long. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The car broke down. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I turned the ignition. (B) The engine overheated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The engine overheated.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the car broke down due to the engine overheating rather than simply turning the ignition. When the engine overheats, it can cause damage to various components and ultimately lead to the car breaking down. Additionally, turning the ignition is just the first step in starting the car and does not necessarily indicate a cause for the breakdown."}}
{"Q": "The man hurt his back. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He went to see a psychiatrist. (B) He stayed in bed for several days.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He stayed in bed for several days.\nExplanation: If the man hurt his back, it is more likely that he would need to rest and recover, which would require him to stay in bed for several days. Seeing a psychiatrist would not be a typical response to a physical injury."}}
{"Q": "I started a fire in the fireplace. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was out of firewood. (B) It was cold in the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the fire was started because it was cold in the house and the fireplace was being used as a source of heat. If the person was out of firewood, they would not have been able to start a fire in the first place."}}
{"Q": "The woman stopped jogging. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She got a cramp in her side. (B) She got a second wind.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She got a cramp in her side.\nExplanation: Getting a cramp in the side is a common occurrence during exercise, especially while jogging. It can cause discomfort and pain, making it difficult to continue jogging. On the other hand, getting a second wind means feeling a sudden burst of energy and renewed strength, which would not cause someone to stop jogging. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I knocked on my neighbor's door. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My neighbor invited me in. (B) My neighbor left her house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My neighbor invited me in.\nExplanation: It is more likely that if you knocked on your neighbor's door, they would invite you in rather than leaving their house. Knocking on someone's door is usually a sign of wanting to talk or visit with them, and it is common for neighbors to invite each other in for a chat or a cup of coffee. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman sighed with frustration. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her husband misunderstood her concerns. (B) Her husband kissed her goodbye.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her husband misunderstood her concerns.\nExplanation: The use of the word \"frustration\" suggests that the woman is feeling annoyed or irritated. If her husband kissed her goodbye, it is unlikely to cause frustration. However, if he misunderstood her concerns, it could lead to frustration as she may feel unheard or dismissed. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The teacher commended the student. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The student answered the question correctly. (B) The student hesitated to answer the question.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The student answered the question correctly.\nExplanation: The word \"commended\" means to praise or express approval. Therefore, it is more likely that the teacher commended the student for answering the question correctly rather than hesitating to answer it."}}
{"Q": "The woman ran out of eggs. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She went to the farm. (B) She went to the supermarket.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She went to the supermarket.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the woman would go to the supermarket to buy eggs as it is a common place to purchase groceries. Going to the farm would be less likely as it implies that the woman has direct access to a farm and can obtain eggs from there."}}
{"Q": "I encountered an old friend. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I revealed a secret to him. (B) I gave him a hug.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I gave him a hug.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the encounter with an old friend would result in a hug rather than revealing a secret. Hugging is a common way to greet and show affection towards friends, especially those who haven't seen each other in a long time. Revealing a secret, on the other hand, would depend on the nature of the secret and the relationship between the two friends."}}
{"Q": "The woman avoided going in the lake. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She caught a fish. (B) It looked contaminated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It looked contaminated.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the woman avoided going in the lake because it looked contaminated. This suggests that the woman may have observed something about the lake that made her believe it was not safe to swim in, such as an unusual color or odor, or signs warning of pollution or harmful bacteria. On the other hand, catching a fish does not necessarily explain why the woman avoided going in the lake, as fishing and swimming are two different activities."}}
{"Q": "The student arrived to class soaking wet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His umbrella was broken. (B) His bike was stolen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His umbrella was broken.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the student got wet due to a broken umbrella, as it would have left him unprotected from the rain. On the other hand, a stolen bike would not necessarily result in the student getting wet."}}
{"Q": "The cursor on the computer screen moved. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The user clicked the mouse. (B) The user shifted the mouse.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The user clicked the mouse.\nExplanation: When the user clicks the mouse, it sends a signal to the computer to move the cursor on the screen. Shifting the mouse without clicking it does not have any effect on the cursor movement. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The driver took a detour. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An accident occurred on the main road. (B) She followed the truck in front of her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that an accident occurred on the main road, causing the driver to take a detour. This is a common reason for drivers to take alternate routes, as accidents can cause traffic delays and road closures. Following a truck in front of her may not be a valid reason for taking a detour, as the driver may not know where the truck is going or if it is taking a safe route. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for the driver's detour."}}
{"Q": "I hung the wet linen on the outdoor clothesline. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The linen dried. (B) The linen stained.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The linen dried.\nExplanation: When wet linen is hung on a clothesline, it is exposed to the sun and wind, which helps to evaporate the moisture from the fabric. As a result, the linen dries and becomes ready to use again. Staining is not a likely outcome unless the clothesline is dirty or the linen is exposed to something that could cause a stain, such as a spill or a chemical."}}
{"Q": "The woman put on her shades. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sunlight was bright. (B) She hailed a cab.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The sunlight was bright.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for someone to put on shades is to protect their eyes from the bright sunlight. Hailing a cab does not require wearing shades, so option B is not a likely cause."}}
{"Q": "The man gazed at the night sky. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wished it were summer. (B) He thought it was beautiful.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He thought it was beautiful.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the man \"gazed\" at the night sky, which implies that he was looking at it for an extended period of time. Additionally, the use of the word \"gazed\" suggests that he was admiring or appreciating the sky. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man was gazing at the night sky because he thought it was beautiful, rather than because he wished it were summer."}}
{"Q": "I felt exhausted. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I went to bed early. (B) I stayed up all night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I went to bed early.\nExplanation: When feeling exhausted, the most plausible response would be to rest and recharge. Going to bed early would allow the body to get the necessary rest it needs to recover from the exhaustion. Staying up all night would only exacerbate the exhaustion and lead to further fatigue."}}
{"Q": "The man went to the barber. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was growing out his hair. (B) His hair was getting long.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His hair was getting long.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the man went to the barber, which implies that he needed a haircut. The reason given is that his hair was getting long, which is a common reason for visiting a barber. Option (A) suggests that the man was intentionally growing out his hair, which is not supported by the given sentence. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy played mean tricks on his new classmate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boy welcomed the new classmate. (B) The boy disliked the new classmate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The boy disliked the new classmate.\nExplanation: The fact that the boy played mean tricks on his new classmate suggests that he had negative feelings towards the new student. If he had welcomed the new classmate, he would have been more likely to be friendly and helpful towards them. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I craved a glass of milk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was eating cookies. (B) I was baking bread.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the craving for milk was caused by eating cookies, as milk is a common beverage to pair with cookies. Baking bread does not necessarily have a direct association with craving milk."}}
{"Q": "It began to rain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The driver turned on the headlights. (B) The driver shifted the car into reverse.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The driver turned on the headlights.\nExplanation: When it starts to rain, visibility on the road decreases, and it becomes difficult to see the road and other vehicles. Therefore, it is necessary to turn on the headlights to improve visibility and avoid accidents. Shifting the car into reverse is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the situation of rain."}}
{"Q": "The parking lot of the building was empty. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I parked across the street. (B) I parked near the entrance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I parked across the street.\nExplanation: Since the parking lot of the building was empty, it is more likely that there were no available parking spaces near the entrance. Therefore, it would be more plausible to park across the street where there may be more available parking spaces."}}
{"Q": "The writer missed her deadline for the draft submission. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She had writer's block. (B) She edited the draft.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She edited the draft.\nExplanation: Editing can be a time-consuming process, and it is possible that the writer spent too much time editing the draft and did not have enough time to complete it before the deadline. Writer's block is also a possibility, but without further information, editing seems like a more plausible explanation."}}
{"Q": "The associate hung up on me. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I asked to speak to a supervisor. (B) I provided my identification number.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I asked to speak to a supervisor.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the associate hung up on the caller because they asked to speak to a supervisor, which may have been perceived as confrontational or challenging. Providing an identification number is a routine part of many customer service interactions and is unlikely to have caused the associate to hang up."}}
{"Q": "The wind blew through the open window. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doorbell rang. (B) The curtains shuddered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The curtains shuddered.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the wind blowing through the open window would cause the curtains to move or shudder, rather than causing the doorbell to ring. The movement of the curtains is a common occurrence when there is a gust of wind, and it is a logical result of the wind blowing through the open window."}}
{"Q": "The electricity in my house shut off. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I unplugged the lamp. (B) I blew a fuse.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I blew a fuse.\nExplanation: If the electricity in the entire house shut off, it is more likely that a fuse was blown rather than just one lamp being unplugged. A blown fuse can occur due to overloading the circuit or a short circuit. It is important to check the fuse box and replace the blown fuse to restore power."}}
{"Q": "The weightlifter grunted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He flexed his muscles in the mirror. (B) He lifted the bar over his head.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He lifted the bar over his head.\nExplanation: Weightlifting requires a lot of physical effort and exertion, especially when lifting heavy weights. The weightlifter grunting is a common occurrence during weightlifting as it helps them to exhale forcefully and stabilize their core muscles, which in turn helps them to lift the weight more effectively. Therefore, it is more plausible that the weightlifter grunted due to the physical effort of lifting the bar over his head rather than flexing his muscles in the mirror."}}
{"Q": "The student tried to do the math in his head. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got out a calculator. (B) He got confused.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He got confused.\nExplanation: Doing math in one's head can be challenging, especially if the problem is complex or involves multiple steps. It is common for students to get confused or make mistakes when trying to solve math problems mentally. While some students may choose to use a calculator to check their work, the given scenario does not suggest that the student did so. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student got confused while trying to do the math in his head."}}
{"Q": "The baby fell asleep. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The father changed the baby's diaper. (B) The father gently rocked the baby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The father gently rocked the baby.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the baby fell asleep because the father gently rocked the baby. Rocking is a common method used to soothe babies and help them fall asleep. Changing a diaper may have made the baby more comfortable, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the baby falling asleep."}}
{"Q": "The girl threw the water balloon at the boy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boy got a concussion. (B) The boy got soaked.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The boy got soaked.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy got wet as a result of the water balloon being thrown at him, rather than getting a concussion. Getting a concussion from a water balloon is highly unlikely and would require a significant amount of force, which is not typically associated with a water balloon. On the other hand, getting soaked is a common result of being hit with a water balloon."}}
{"Q": "The photographer forgot to use the flash on the camera. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The photos turned out blurry. (B) Everyone in the photos refused to smile.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The photos turned out blurry.\nExplanation: When the photographer forgets to use the flash on the camera, the photos may turn out blurry if there is not enough light in the environment. This is because the camera will use a slower shutter speed to compensate for the lack of light, which can result in motion blur if the subjects or the camera move even slightly during the exposure. On the other hand, the lack of flash does not necessarily affect the subjects' willingness to smile or pose for the photo."}}
{"Q": "I declined the invitation to the birthday party. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was lonely. (B) I was out of town.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I was out of town.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if someone is out of town, they may not be able to attend a birthday party. On the other hand, if someone is feeling lonely, they may be more likely to attend a social event like a birthday party."}}
{"Q": "I exercised. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I felt energetic. (B) I was scared.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Feeling energetic is a more plausible cause for exercising than being scared. When we feel energetic, we are more likely to engage in physical activity, whereas fear may cause us to freeze or flee rather than exercise. Additionally, exercise is known to increase energy levels, so it is possible that the act of exercising itself contributed to the feeling of energy."}}
{"Q": "I squeezed the damp sponge. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It soaked up water. (B) Water seeped out of it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Water seeped out of it.\n\nExplanation: When a sponge is damp, it is already saturated with water. Squeezing it will cause the excess water to be forced out of the sponge, resulting in water seeping out of it. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer. Option A would be the result if the sponge was dry and then soaked up water when squeezed."}}
{"Q": "The vacationers took a ferry to the resort. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The resort was booked. (B) The resort was on an island.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The resort was on an island.\nExplanation: The fact that the vacationers took a ferry to the resort suggests that the resort was located on an island, which would make it inaccessible by car or other means of transportation. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) is unlikely because if the resort was fully booked, the vacationers would have had to find alternative accommodation, rather than taking a ferry to the resort."}}
{"Q": "The teenager got a tattoo. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was afraid of needles. (B) She wanted to rebel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She wanted to rebel.\nExplanation: Teenagers often get tattoos as a way to express their individuality and rebellion against societal norms. It is unlikely that someone who is afraid of needles would voluntarily get a tattoo, which involves multiple needle pricks. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "An unfamiliar car parked outside my house. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I became suspicious. (B) I called the police.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I became suspicious.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that seeing an unfamiliar car parked outside one's house would make them suspicious rather than immediately calling the police. It is possible that the car belongs to a neighbor or a visitor, and calling the police without any evidence of suspicious activity could be an overreaction. Therefore, becoming suspicious and keeping an eye on the car would be a more reasonable first step."}}
{"Q": "The criminal turned himself in. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The evidence implicated him. (B)  There was no evidence against him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The evidence implicated him.\nExplanation: If the criminal turned himself in, it is likely because he knew that the evidence against him was strong and that he would eventually be caught. It is unlikely that someone would turn themselves in if there was no evidence against them. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The heavyset man decided to lose weight. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He cut out sweets. (B) He avoided caffeine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He cut out sweets.\nExplanation: Cutting out sweets is a more plausible answer as it is a common step people take when trying to lose weight. Sweets are high in calories and cutting them out can lead to a significant reduction in calorie intake, which can result in weight loss. Avoiding caffeine may have some health benefits, but it is not directly related to weight loss."}}
{"Q": "The girl stepped on the ice. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She slid. (B) She shivered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She slid.\nExplanation: When someone steps on ice, it is likely that they will slide due to the slippery surface. Shivering may also occur if the temperature is very cold, but it is not a direct result of stepping on ice. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman had rings under her eyes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She stayed up all night. (B) She put her son to bed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She stayed up all night.\nExplanation: Rings under the eyes are a common symptom of sleep deprivation, which can be caused by staying up all night. Putting her son to bed may have caused her to lose some sleep, but it is unlikely to cause significant enough sleep deprivation to result in rings under her eyes."}}
{"Q": "Lava flowed from the volcano. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The volcano erupted. (B) The volcano was dormant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The volcano erupted.\nExplanation: Lava is molten rock that is expelled from a volcano during an eruption. Therefore, the most plausible cause of lava flowing from a volcano is that the volcano has erupted. Option B, which suggests that the volcano was dormant, does not explain the presence of lava."}}
{"Q": "The woman put her shoes on. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She knew everyone at the party. (B) She wanted to leave the party.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She wanted to leave the party.\nExplanation: The action of putting on shoes is often associated with leaving a place or going somewhere. Therefore, it is more plausible that the woman put on her shoes because she wanted to leave the party. Option (A) does not provide a clear reason for why she would put on her shoes."}}
{"Q": "I paid the tollbooth attendant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She let me pass through the tollbooth. (B) She detained me at the tollbooth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She let me pass through the tollbooth.\nExplanation: It is common practice for tollbooth attendants to collect payment and allow vehicles to pass through. Therefore, it is more plausible that the attendant would let the person pass through after payment rather than detain them."}}
{"Q": "The executive went bankrupt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He sold his company stock. (B) He squandered his fortune.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Squandering one's fortune is a more plausible cause of bankruptcy than selling company stock. Selling stock may result in financial loss, but it does not necessarily lead to bankruptcy. On the other hand, squandering one's fortune through excessive spending or poor investments can quickly deplete one's financial resources and lead to bankruptcy."}}
{"Q": "The man went to the doctor. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor was on leave. (B) The man felt ill.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The man felt ill.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for a person to visit a doctor is when they feel ill or have some health concerns. Option (A) that the doctor was on leave is not a likely cause for the man to visit the doctor. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I exited my bedroom through the window. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The house was on fire. (B) The house was empty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The house was empty.\nExplanation: If the house was on fire, it would be more logical to exit through the door and use the designated fire escape route. Exiting through the window would be a last resort. However, if the house was empty, it is possible that the person exited through the window to avoid being seen or to access a different part of the property."}}
{"Q": "The boy's fingers became pruny. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He took a long shower. (B) He lathered his hands with soap.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He took a long shower.\nExplanation: When skin is exposed to water for a prolonged period of time, it can cause the outer layer of skin to absorb water and swell, which can lead to the wrinkling or pruning of the skin on the fingers. This is a common occurrence when someone takes a long shower or bath. Lathering hands with soap alone would not typically cause the fingers to become pruny."}}
{"Q": "I spit out the milk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The milk tasted sour. (B) My mouth was dry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The milk tasted sour.\nExplanation: If the milk tasted sour, it would be a natural reaction to spit it out. On the other hand, if the mouth was dry, it would not necessarily cause someone to spit out the milk. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I missed the bus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was early to work. (B) I was late to work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I was late to work.\nExplanation: If you missed the bus, it means you were not able to catch it on time and had to wait for the next one or find an alternative mode of transportation. This delay would have caused you to arrive at work later than expected, making option (B) the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The truck collided with the car. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The truck sped up. (B) The car got smashed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The car got smashed.\nExplanation: When a truck collides with a car, it is highly likely that the car will get smashed or damaged due to the impact. It is not plausible that the truck would speed up after a collision as it would be unsafe and could cause further accidents. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The team rigged the contest in their favor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They won. (B)  They dropped out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They won.\nExplanation: If the team rigged the contest in their favor, it is likely that they would have an advantage over the other participants and would be more likely to win. Rigging a contest usually involves manipulating the rules or the judging process to ensure a desired outcome. Therefore, it is more plausible that the team would win rather than drop out."}}
{"Q": "The soda bottle hissed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I turned over the bottle. (B) I twisted off the cap.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I twisted off the cap.\nExplanation: The hissing sound from a soda bottle is usually caused by the release of carbon dioxide gas that is dissolved in the liquid. When the cap is twisted off, the pressure inside the bottle decreases, causing the gas to escape and creating the hissing sound. Turning over the bottle would not necessarily cause the hissing sound unless the cap was already partially open or damaged."}}
{"Q": "The boy was locked out of his house. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He crawled in through an open window. (B) He climbed up to the roof.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He crawled in through an open window.\nExplanation: Climbing up to the roof is a dangerous and unlikely solution to being locked out of the house. Crawling in through an open window, on the other hand, is a more plausible solution as it is a common way for people to enter their homes when they are locked out."}}
{"Q": "The doorbell rang. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The visitor tapped the knocker on the door. (B) The woman peered through the keyhole in the door.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The visitor tapped the knocker on the door.\nExplanation: The doorbell ringing is usually associated with a button or switch that is pressed outside the door, which triggers a sound inside the house. Therefore, it is more likely that the visitor tapped the knocker on the door to make a sound, rather than the woman peering through the keyhole in the door."}}
{"Q": "The man stained his suit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He got it dry-cleaned. (B) He hung it in his closet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He got it dry-cleaned.\nExplanation: If the man stained his suit, it is likely that he would want to clean it. Hanging it in his closet would not remove the stain, so option B is not a plausible answer. Therefore, option A, getting it dry-cleaned, is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "The girl squeezed the tube of toothpaste. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The toothpaste squirted out of the tube. (B) The girl spit out the toothpaste.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The toothpaste squirted out of the tube.\nExplanation: When a tube of toothpaste is squeezed, the pressure inside the tube increases, causing the toothpaste to be forced out of the opening. Therefore, it is more plausible that the toothpaste squirted out of the tube rather than the girl spitting it out."}}
{"Q": "Civilian deaths from the war surged. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Pacifists staged a protest. (B) Pacifists held a parade.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Pacifists staged a protest.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that pacifists would stage a protest in response to an increase in civilian deaths from the war, as they are opposed to violence and would likely want to draw attention to the human cost of war. Holding a parade would not be an appropriate response to such a serious issue."}}
{"Q": "The girl yanked the ribbon out of her hair. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She tied the ribbon. (B) The ribbon looked babyish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The ribbon looked babyish.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the girl yanked the ribbon out of her hair, which implies that she did it abruptly and forcefully. The reason for this action is given in the second part of the sentence, which states that the ribbon looked babyish. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it provides a logical explanation for the girl's behavior."}}
{"Q": "The man got plastic surgery. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He aged. (B) He looked younger.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He looked younger.\nExplanation: Plastic surgery is often done to improve one's appearance and reduce the signs of aging. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man looked younger after getting plastic surgery."}}
{"Q": "A baby chicken emerged from the egg. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The egg hatched. (B) I cracked the egg.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The egg hatched.\nExplanation: When a baby chicken emerges from an egg, it means that the egg has hatched. This is a natural process that occurs when the chick inside the egg has developed enough to break through the shell and emerge into the world. Cracking the egg would not result in a live baby chicken, as the embryo inside would not have had the opportunity to fully develop and hatch."}}
{"Q": "The prisoner starved. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He died. (B) He fled.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He died.\nExplanation: When a person starves, their body begins to break down its own tissues for energy, leading to organ failure and eventually death. Fleeing would require physical strength and energy, which the prisoner would not have if they were starving. Therefore, it is more plausible that the prisoner died as a result of starvation."}}
{"Q": "The man lost his balance on the ladder. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He climbed up the ladder. (B) He fell off the ladder.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He fell off the ladder.\nExplanation: Losing balance on a ladder often leads to falling off the ladder, which can result in injuries or even death. Climbing up the ladder is not a plausible outcome in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "The child burped. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He took a swig of soda. (B) He opened the soda can.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He took a swig of soda.\nExplanation: Burping is a common reaction to drinking carbonated beverages, such as soda. When the child took a swig of soda, they likely ingested a significant amount of carbon dioxide gas, which can build up in the stomach and cause a burp. Opening a soda can alone would not typically cause a burp, as the gas is released slowly and does not enter the stomach in large quantities."}}
{"Q": "A cold draft came in through the window. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I relaxed. (B) I shivered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I shivered.\nExplanation: When a cold draft comes in through a window, it lowers the temperature in the room and can cause a person to feel cold. Shivering is a natural response of the body to generate heat and maintain its core temperature. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person would shiver rather than relax in response to a cold draft."}}
{"Q": "The student received a scholarship to go to college. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her classmates respected her. (B) She made good grades.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She made good grades.\nExplanation: Scholarships are typically awarded based on academic merit, which is often measured by a student's grades. While being respected by classmates can be a positive factor in a student's life, it is not typically a determining factor in receiving a scholarship. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student received the scholarship due to her good grades."}}
{"Q": "The girl poked fun at the boy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She lived next door to him. (B) She had a crush on him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She had a crush on him.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the girl poked fun at the boy because she had a crush on him. Teasing or making fun of someone is a common way for children to express their feelings of attraction or affection. Living next door to someone does not necessarily lead to teasing or making fun of them."}}
{"Q": "The hungry vagrant stole food. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He incited pity. (B) He had no money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He had no money.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for the hungry vagrant to steal food is that he had no money to buy it. This is a common reason for theft, especially among those who are homeless or living in poverty. While it is possible that the vagrant incited pity, this alone would not necessarily lead to stealing food."}}
{"Q": "I called my friend to chat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I wanted privacy. (B) I felt lonely.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I felt lonely.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for calling a friend to chat is because one is feeling lonely and wants to connect with someone. Privacy may be a factor in some cases, but it is not the most likely reason for calling a friend to chat."}}
{"Q": "The man extended his hand to me. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I shook his hand. (B) I slapped him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I shook his hand.\nExplanation: It is a common social norm to shake hands when someone extends their hand towards you. Slapping someone's hand in this situation would be considered rude and inappropriate. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person shook the man's hand as a sign of greeting or introduction."}}
{"Q": "I ducked. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fireworks launched up in the air. (B) The frisbee soared towards my head.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The fireworks launched up in the air.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cause of ducking was the fireworks launched up in the air as they are known to be loud and can startle people, causing them to duck for cover. On the other hand, a frisbee soaring towards someone's head is not a common occurrence and may not be the first thing that comes to mind when someone says they ducked."}}
{"Q": "The girl bit her nails. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was worried. (B) She was surprised.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was worried.\nExplanation: Nail biting is a common habit that people often do when they are anxious or stressed. Therefore, it is more plausible that the girl was biting her nails because she was worried about something rather than being surprised."}}
{"Q": "I turned the page on the calendar. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I marked an appointment on the calendar. (B) It was the beginning of a new month.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It was the beginning of a new month.\nExplanation: The act of turning the page on a calendar is typically done at the start of a new month. It is a common practice to use a calendar to keep track of dates and events, and turning the page to a new month is a natural progression of time. While it is possible that someone may turn the page on a calendar to mark an appointment or event, it is more likely that the cause of turning the page is simply the start of a new month."}}
{"Q": "The husband discovered that his wife was having an affair. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He fired his lawyer. (B) He filed for divorce.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He filed for divorce.\nExplanation: Discovering that one's spouse is having an affair is a serious breach of trust in a marriage. It often leads to feelings of betrayal and hurt, and can ultimately result in the breakdown of the relationship. Filing for divorce is a common response to this situation, as the injured party may feel that they can no longer trust or continue to be with their partner. Firing a lawyer is not a logical response to discovering an affair, as it is not related to legal representation."}}
{"Q": "The girl dropped the rubber ball. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The ball bounced. (B) The ball glowed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The ball bounced.\nExplanation: When a rubber ball is dropped, it is likely to bounce due to its elastic properties. The force of the impact with the ground causes the ball to compress, and then it quickly rebounds back to its original shape, resulting in a bouncing motion. On the other hand, there is no logical reason for the ball to glow just because it was dropped. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl made a mistake on her exam. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She guessed at the answer. (B) She erased her answer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: She received a lower grade on her exam.\nExplanation: It is more likely that making a mistake on an exam would result in a lower grade rather than guessing or erasing an answer."}}
{"Q": "The player tackled his opponent. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His opponent caught the pass. (B) His opponent hit the ground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. His opponent hit the ground.\nExplanation: When a player tackles their opponent in football, the goal is to bring them to the ground and prevent them from advancing with the ball. Therefore, it is more plausible that the opponent hit the ground as a result of the tackle rather than catching a pass, which would be unrelated to the tackle."}}
{"Q": "I picked the tomatoes from the vine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were ripe. (B) I watered them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They were ripe.\nExplanation: Tomatoes are typically picked when they are fully ripe and have reached their peak flavor and texture. Watering the tomatoes may help them grow, but it does not necessarily cause them to be ready for picking. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man wanted to act romantic. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He met his ex-girlfriend for lunch. (B) He bought his girlfriend chocolates.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He bought his girlfriend chocolates.\nExplanation: Buying chocolates is a common romantic gesture, so it is more plausible than meeting an ex-girlfriend for lunch."}}
{"Q": "The mercury in the thermometer rose. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I dropped the thermometer. (B) The weather got warmer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The weather got warmer.\nExplanation: The rise in temperature indicated by the mercury in the thermometer is more likely to be caused by external factors such as changes in the weather, rather than internal factors such as dropping the thermometer. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A tornado came through the town. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The roof of the courthouse blew off. (B) The highway became dangerously icy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The roof of the courthouse blew off.\nExplanation: Tornadoes are known for their strong winds that can cause significant damage to buildings and structures. It is plausible that the courthouse, being a large and prominent building, would be affected by the tornado and have its roof blown off. On the other hand, the highway becoming dangerously icy is not a likely result of a tornado, as tornadoes are associated with warm and humid weather conditions, not cold and icy ones."}}
{"Q": "The student received tutoring. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His grades improved. (B) He cheated on the exam.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His grades improved.\nExplanation: It is more likely that receiving tutoring would lead to an improvement in grades, as the student would have received additional help and support in understanding the material. Cheating on an exam would not be a direct result of receiving tutoring."}}
{"Q": "I felt comfortable. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I kneeled down on the ground. (B) I wrapped myself in a blanket.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I wrapped myself in a blanket.\nExplanation: Wrapping oneself in a blanket can provide warmth and a sense of security, which can lead to feelings of comfort. Kneeling down on the ground may not necessarily lead to feelings of comfort."}}
{"Q": "I polished the stone. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It became slippery. (B) It became shiny.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It became shiny.\nExplanation: When a stone is polished, it means that its surface has been smoothed and made shiny by rubbing it with a material like sandpaper or a polishing compound. Therefore, the most plausible result of polishing a stone is that it becomes shiny. While it may also become slightly smoother, it is unlikely to become slippery unless it is wet or coated with a substance that makes it slippery."}}
{"Q": "I added sugar to the coffee. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The coffee smelled strong. (B) The coffee tasted sweet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The coffee tasted sweet.\nExplanation: Adding sugar to coffee typically results in a sweeter taste, as sugar is a sweetener. It is unlikely that adding sugar would affect the smell of the coffee. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man shuffled through the papers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He got a paper cut. (B) He shredded the papers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: None of the above.\nExplanation: The sentence does not provide enough information to determine what happened as a result of the man shuffling through the papers. It is possible that he found what he was looking for, or that he simply organized the papers without any significant outcome. Therefore, neither option A nor B is a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I pounded the nail with the hammer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The nail sunk into the wood. (B) The nail became rusty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The nail sunk into the wood.\nExplanation: When a nail is pounded with a hammer, the force applied by the hammer causes the nail to penetrate the wood, sinking it into the surface. Rust is a chemical reaction that occurs over time due to exposure to moisture and oxygen, and is not a direct result of hammering a nail. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The fish bit the line. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fisherman reeled in the fish. (B) The fisherman recast the line.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The fisherman reeled in the fish.\nExplanation: When a fish bites the line, the natural response of the fisherman is to reel in the line to catch the fish. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B, which suggests that the fisherman recast the line, is less likely as it would not make sense to cast the line again after a fish has already bitten it."}}
{"Q": "The teenager was embarrassed to go to school. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She got a pimple. (B) She got her braces off.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She got a pimple.\nExplanation: Teenagers often feel self-conscious about their appearance, and a sudden breakout of acne can be particularly embarrassing. Getting braces off, on the other hand, is usually seen as a positive change and is unlikely to cause embarrassment. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My facial expression lit up. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I received good news. (B) I lost my patience.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I received good news.\nExplanation: When someone's facial expression lights up, it usually indicates a positive emotion such as happiness, excitement, or surprise. Receiving good news is a common cause of such a reaction, while losing patience is more likely to result in a negative or frustrated expression. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "I wiped my hands with a towel. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The towel was wet. (B) My hands were wet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. My hands were wet.\nExplanation: If the towel was wet, it would not necessarily mean that I would wipe my hands with it. However, if my hands were wet, it would make sense to wipe them with a towel to dry them off. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man lost his balance on the stool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The stool wobbled underneath him. (B) He spilled paint on the stool.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The stool wobbled underneath him.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man lost his balance on the stool because it wobbled underneath him. This is a common cause of falling off a stool, as opposed to spilling paint on the stool, which would not necessarily affect the stability of the stool."}}
{"Q": "The teammates directed blame at each other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They lost their game. (B) Their coach cancelled practice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They lost their game.\nExplanation: It is common for teammates to direct blame at each other after losing a game. They may feel frustrated and disappointed, and may try to find someone to blame for the loss. On the other hand, if their coach cancelled practice, it is unlikely that they would direct blame at each other."}}
{"Q": "I asked for forgiveness. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I regretted my mistake. (B) I achieved my goal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I regretted my mistake.\nExplanation: Asking for forgiveness usually implies that one has done something wrong or hurtful to another person. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of asking for forgiveness is due to regretting a mistake or wrongdoing, rather than achieving a goal."}}
{"Q": "The woman became bored with her date. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He asked her questions about herself. (B) He talked incessantly about himself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He talked incessantly about himself.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the woman became bored with her date because he talked too much about himself, rather than because he asked her questions about herself. When someone talks excessively about themselves, it can come across as self-centered and uninterested in the other person. On the other hand, asking questions about the other person shows a genuine interest in getting to know them. Therefore, it is more plausible that the woman became bored because her date was not engaging in a balanced conversation."}}
{"Q": "The girl flashed a smile. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her cheeks reddened. (B) Her dimples showed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Her dimples showed.\nExplanation: When someone flashes a smile, it usually means they are showing their teeth and their facial muscles are contracting. In some people, this contraction causes their dimples to show. Therefore, it is more plausible that the girl's dimples showed as a result of her smile rather than her cheeks reddening, which is not a common physiological response to smiling."}}
{"Q": "The enemy ship blew up. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It passed over the mine. (B) It sailed into the harbor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the enemy ship blew up because it passed over a mine. Sailing into a harbor alone would not typically cause a ship to explode. Mines are commonly used as a defensive measure to protect harbors and other strategic locations, and passing over one could easily result in an explosion."}}
{"Q": "The man punctured his foot. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He walked into a puddle. (B) He stepped on broken glass.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He stepped on broken glass.\nExplanation: Stepping on broken glass is a common cause of foot punctures. Walking into a puddle is unlikely to cause a foot puncture unless there was sharp debris in the water. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The detectives dusted the crime scene for fingerprints. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They discovered the identity of the murderer. (B) They found the weapon at the crime scene.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) They discovered the identity of the murderer.\nExplanation: Dusting for fingerprints is a common technique used by detectives to identify potential suspects. By collecting and analyzing fingerprints found at the crime scene, detectives can match them to known individuals in a database or use them to eliminate suspects. While it is possible that the weapon could have been found through fingerprint analysis, it is more likely that the fingerprints would lead to the identification of the perpetrator. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There was a lot of traffic on the highway. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I took a detour. (B) I asked for a ride.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I took a detour.\nExplanation: When there is a lot of traffic on the highway, it can cause delays and make it difficult to reach your destination on time. Taking a detour is a common solution to avoid the traffic and reach your destination faster. Asking for a ride may not be a plausible solution as it may not be possible to find someone who is going in the same direction as you and has space in their vehicle."}}
{"Q": "The nation's economy declined. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many people got sick. (B) Many people faced unemployment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Many people faced unemployment.\nExplanation: When the economy declines, businesses may struggle to make profits and may have to lay off workers. This can lead to a rise in unemployment rates as many people lose their jobs. It is a common consequence of an economic downturn. While a decline in the economy may have other negative effects, such as a decrease in consumer spending or a decrease in government revenue, unemployment is a direct and significant impact on individuals and families."}}
{"Q": "The crossing guard blew her whistle at the children. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were about to walk into oncoming traffic. (B) She recognized them from her neighborhood.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the crossing guard blew her whistle at the children because they were about to walk into oncoming traffic. This is the primary responsibility of a crossing guard - to ensure the safety of pedestrians crossing the street. Blowing the whistle is a signal to the children to stop and wait for the traffic to clear before crossing the street. Option B is less likely as recognizing children from her neighborhood would not necessarily require blowing a whistle."}}
{"Q": "I rolled my eyes at my friend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He told me the truth. (B) He made a sarcastic remark.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He made a sarcastic remark.\nExplanation: Rolling one's eyes is often a nonverbal expression of annoyance or disbelief. In this case, the most plausible reason for rolling one's eyes at a friend would be if they made a sarcastic remark that was perceived as insincere or mocking. While it's possible that the friend told the truth about something that was frustrating or disappointing, that alone wouldn't necessarily warrant an eye roll."}}
{"Q": "The car ran out of gas. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The driver was stranded on the road. (B) The driver picked up a hitchhiker.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The driver was stranded on the road.\nExplanation: When a car runs out of gas, it cannot continue to run. Therefore, the driver would be unable to continue driving and would be stranded on the road until they can obtain more gas or assistance. Picking up a hitchhiker is not a likely result of running out of gas."}}
{"Q": "The woman went into labor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The baby was delivered. (B) The woman had morning sickness.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The baby was delivered.\nExplanation: When a woman goes into labor, it means that the process of childbirth has started. The contractions of the uterus become stronger and more frequent, leading to the opening of the cervix. This allows the baby to move through the birth canal and be delivered. Therefore, it is more plausible that the woman gave birth to the baby rather than experiencing morning sickness, which is a common symptom during the early stages of pregnancy."}}
{"Q": "The man's hat blew away. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He took off the hat. (B) It was windy outside.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It was windy outside.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that it was windy outside, which caused the man's hat to blow away. If the man had taken off his hat, it would not have blown away on its own. Therefore, the wind is the most likely cause of the hat blowing away."}}
{"Q": "The girl attended her classmate's birthday party. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She received an invitation. (B) She bought a gift.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She received an invitation.\nExplanation: The most common reason for attending a birthday party is receiving an invitation. It is not necessary to buy a gift to attend a party, although it is a nice gesture. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy's forehead felt hot. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His mother took his temperature. (B) His mother took him to the park.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His mother took his temperature.\nExplanation: When a person's forehead feels hot, it is often a sign of a fever. Therefore, the most plausible action for the mother to take would be to check the boy's temperature to determine if he is indeed running a fever. Taking him to the park would not be a logical response to a potential illness."}}
{"Q": "The man sprayed himself with cologne. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wanted to impress his date. (B) He put gel in his hair.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He wanted to impress his date.\nExplanation: The act of spraying oneself with cologne is often associated with wanting to smell good and make a good impression on others. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man sprayed himself with cologne to impress his date rather than because he put gel in his hair."}}
{"Q": "The electricity in the house shut off. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I looked for a flashlight. (B) I picked up a shovel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I looked for a flashlight.\nExplanation: When the electricity in the house shuts off, it becomes dark and difficult to see. Therefore, the most plausible action would be to look for a flashlight or other source of light to navigate through the darkness. Picking up a shovel would not be a logical response to a power outage."}}
{"Q": "The family moved into a bigger house. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The son graduated from high school. (B) The mother gave birth to twins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The mother gave birth to twins.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the family needed a bigger house due to the addition of two new family members, rather than the son graduating from high school. Graduating from high school does not typically require a family to move into a bigger house, whereas having twins would require more space and accommodations."}}
{"Q": "The marathoner kept at a slow pace. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She wanted to conserve her energy. (B) She saw the finish line.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She wanted to conserve her energy.\nExplanation: Marathon runners often pace themselves to conserve their energy and avoid burning out too quickly. By maintaining a slower pace, the runner can sustain their energy levels and finish the race strong. Seeing the finish line may motivate the runner, but it is unlikely to cause them to slow down their pace."}}
{"Q": "The boy kicked the vending machine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The machine spit out the change. (B) The bag of chips was stuck.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The bag of chips was stuck.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy kicked the vending machine because the bag of chips was stuck and he was frustrated that he couldn't get his snack. It is unlikely that the machine would spit out change as a cause for the boy's behavior."}}
{"Q": "My friend's dog died. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I rolled my eyes at him. (B) I gave him a hug.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I gave him a hug.\nExplanation: It is more plausible to offer comfort and support to a friend who has lost a beloved pet. Rolling one's eyes would be insensitive and inappropriate in this situation. A hug can convey empathy and show that you are there for your friend during a difficult time."}}
{"Q": "The businessman's credit card got declined. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wrote an IOU. (B) He paid with cash.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He paid with cash.\nExplanation: If the businessman's credit card got declined, it means that the transaction could not be completed using the card. Therefore, the most plausible option would be for him to pay with cash instead. Writing an IOU would not be a practical solution as it would require the other party to trust that the businessman would pay them back at a later time."}}
{"Q": "The man cursed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He clipped his nails. (B) He stubbed his toe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Stubbing one's toe is a common and painful experience that often elicits a curse or exclamation of frustration. Clipping one's nails, on the other hand, is a routine and relatively painless activity that is unlikely to provoke such a reaction. Therefore, option B is a more plausible cause for the man's cursing."}}
{"Q": "The man felt proud of his brother. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His brother got in an argument with their parents. (B) His brother got accepted into law school.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His brother got accepted into law school.\nExplanation: Getting accepted into law school is a significant achievement that requires hard work and dedication. It is a cause for pride for the man as his brother has accomplished something that is not easy to achieve. On the other hand, getting into an argument with parents is not necessarily a positive thing and may not be a cause for pride. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl wanted to learn about the solar system. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She went to the library. (B) She looked at the stars.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She went to the library.\nExplanation: Going to the library is a more plausible answer as it is a common place to find books and resources about the solar system. Looking at the stars may be interesting, but it may not provide enough information for someone who wants to learn about the solar system."}}
{"Q": "The poster stuck to the wall. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I positioned the poster above the door. (B) I put tape on the back of the poster.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I put tape on the back of the poster.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the poster being stuck to the wall is that tape was used to attach it. Positioning the poster above the door may have contributed to it staying in place, but without some form of adhesive, it would not have stuck to the wall. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The client approved the architect's plans for the building. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The architect constructed the building. (B) The architect adjusted the plans.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The architect constructed the building.\nExplanation: If the client approved the architect's plans for the building, it means that the client was satisfied with the design and gave permission for the architect to proceed with the construction. Therefore, the architect would have constructed the building according to the approved plans. Option B, where the architect adjusted the plans, would only be applicable if the client requested changes to the plans after approval."}}
{"Q": "The man dropped his spoon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His hand was shaking. (B) He licked the spoon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His hand was shaking.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man's hand was shaking, causing him to drop his spoon. Licking the spoon would not cause it to drop, and is not a likely cause of the incident. On the other hand, hand tremors or shaking can be caused by a variety of factors such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, or even just nervousness. Therefore, option A is the most logical explanation for the man dropping his spoon."}}
{"Q": "The CEO of the company resigned. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The board of directors dissolved the company. (B) The board of directors found his replacement.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The board of directors found his replacement.\nExplanation: It is unlikely that the resignation of the CEO would result in the dissolution of the entire company. Instead, the board of directors would likely search for a new CEO to fill the position and continue running the company. This is a common practice in the business world when a CEO resigns or retires."}}
{"Q": "I arrived late to the lecture. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I took a seat in the back row. (B) I approached the podium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I took a seat in the back row.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that if someone arrives late to a lecture, they would try to find a seat in the back row rather than approaching the podium. Approaching the podium would draw attention to oneself and disrupt the lecture, whereas taking a seat in the back row would allow the person to quietly enter and not disturb the lecture."}}
{"Q": "The man was released from jail. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His family paid his bail. (B) He attacked a fellow inmate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His family paid his bail.\nExplanation: If the man was released from jail, it is more likely that his family paid his bail rather than him attacking a fellow inmate. Attacking a fellow inmate would likely result in additional charges and a longer stay in jail. Paying bail, on the other hand, is a common way for individuals to be released from jail while awaiting trial or sentencing."}}
{"Q": "The family lost all their belongings. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They sold their house. (B) Their house caught fire.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Their house caught fire.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as a fire can quickly destroy all of a family's belongings, including their home. Selling a house would not necessarily result in the loss of all belongings, as they could be moved to a new location."}}
{"Q": "I stomped on the aluminum can. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The can was recycled. (B) The can got crushed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The can got crushed.\nExplanation: When you stomp on an aluminum can, the pressure and force applied to it causes it to collapse and become crushed. This is a common way to prepare cans for recycling, but it does not necessarily mean that the can was recycled immediately after being crushed."}}
{"Q": "The girl joined the debate team. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She learned to use a computer. (B) She learned communication skills.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She learned communication skills.\nExplanation: Joining the debate team would likely involve practicing and improving communication skills such as public speaking, critical thinking, and persuasive argumentation. Learning to use a computer is not necessarily a direct result of joining a debate team."}}
{"Q": "My mood improved. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I listened to music. (B) I did the dishes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I listened to music.\nExplanation: Listening to music has been shown to have a positive effect on mood by releasing dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. Doing the dishes may provide a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction, but it is less likely to directly impact mood in the same way that music can."}}
{"Q": "The charity made a goal to raise money. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They fed the homeless. (B) They held an auction.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They held an auction.\nExplanation: Since the charity made a goal to raise money, holding an auction would be a more plausible answer as it is a common fundraising event. Feeding the homeless may be a possible outcome of the money raised, but it is not a direct result of the charity's goal to raise funds."}}
{"Q": "The roller coaster plunged down the steep drop. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The passengers giggled. (B) The passengers screamed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The passengers screamed.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the passengers would scream as a result of the roller coaster plunging down a steep drop. Screaming is a common reaction to the sudden drop and rush of adrenaline that comes with riding a roller coaster. Giggling may also occur, but it is less likely to be the immediate and predominant reaction."}}
{"Q": "I was furious. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I checked the mailbox upon leaving the house. (B) I slammed the door upon leaving the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I slammed the door upon leaving the house.\nExplanation: Slamming the door is a common physical expression of anger and frustration. Checking the mailbox does not seem like a logical response to being furious. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man wanted to watch the sunrise. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He travelled north. (B) He got up early.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He got up early.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man got up early because watching the sunrise is typically an early morning activity. Traveling north may or may not have been necessary depending on the man's location, but getting up early would be a necessary step to watch the sunrise regardless of location."}}
{"Q": "I folded the paper. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I recycled the paper. (B) The paper creased.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The paper creased.\nExplanation: When you fold a paper, it creates a crease or a bend in the paper. Recycling the paper is not a direct result of folding it."}}
{"Q": "The nation endured a natural disaster. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Leaders of other countries formed an alliance. (B) Leaders of other countries sent emergency relief.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Leaders of other countries sent emergency relief.\nExplanation: When a nation endures a natural disaster, it is common for other countries to send emergency relief to help those affected. This can include supplies such as food, water, and medical aid, as well as personnel to assist with search and rescue efforts. Forming an alliance may be a long-term goal, but immediate aid is typically the first priority."}}
{"Q": "The boy's clothes got soaked. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He climbed out of the pool. (B) He fell into the pool.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He fell into the pool.\nExplanation: If the boy climbed out of the pool, it is unlikely that his clothes would get soaked unless he was dripping wet or it was raining heavily. However, if he fell into the pool, it is highly probable that his clothes would get soaked. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The student rushed to finish the book. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was due to be returned to the library. (B) He borrowed it from a friend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was due to be returned to the library.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the student rushed to finish the book because it was due to be returned to the library. When borrowing a book from the library, there is usually a set due date by which the book must be returned. If the student did not finish the book before the due date, they would have to pay a fine or risk losing their borrowing privileges. Therefore, it is likely that the student rushed to finish the book in order to return it on time and avoid any penalties. Option B, that the student borrowed it from a friend, does not provide a clear reason for why the student would need to rush to finish the book."}}
{"Q": "The criminal was executed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was thrown in jail. (B) He was convicted of murder.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was convicted of murder.\nExplanation: The word \"executed\" implies that the criminal was put to death as a punishment for a serious crime. The only plausible option from the given choices is that he was convicted of murder, which is a capital offense in many countries. Being thrown in jail is a possible consequence of committing a crime, but it does not necessarily lead to execution. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of the criminal's execution."}}
{"Q": "Sunlight entered the room. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I opened the curtains. (B) I unlocked the door.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I opened the curtains.\nExplanation: Sunlight entering a room is usually caused by the opening of curtains or blinds, allowing the light to pass through the window. Unlocking the door would not necessarily result in sunlight entering the room unless the door led to an area with windows or an open space. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I yanked the imposter's hair. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her wig came off. (B) She went bald.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her wig came off.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the imposter was wearing a wig, which came off when their hair was yanked, rather than them going bald instantly. Yanking someone's hair can cause discomfort and pain, but it is unlikely to cause immediate baldness. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "The editor reworded a sentence in the manuscript. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found the manuscript compelling. (B) He deemed the sentence unclear.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He deemed the sentence unclear.\nExplanation: The editor's decision to reword a sentence in the manuscript suggests that he found it difficult to understand or ambiguous. Therefore, it is more plausible that he deemed the sentence unclear rather than finding the manuscript compelling, which is not directly related to the need for rewording a sentence."}}
{"Q": "The woman cancelled her credit card account. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She realized the card was missing. (B) She realized the card was expired.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She realized the card was missing.\nExplanation: If the woman realized that her credit card was missing, she would likely cancel the account to prevent any unauthorized charges. On the other hand, if she realized that the card was expired, she would simply need to request a new card from the issuer and would not necessarily need to cancel the account. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man and woman fell in love. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They attended college. (B) They got married.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They got married.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that falling in love would lead to marriage rather than attending college. While attending college may be a possibility for the couple, it is not necessarily a direct result of falling in love. On the other hand, getting married is a common outcome of a romantic relationship."}}
{"Q": "The music was too faint to hear. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I turned up the volume. (B) I composed my own song.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I turned up the volume.\nExplanation: If the music was too faint to hear, the most plausible solution would be to turn up the volume so that it becomes audible. Composing a new song would not solve the problem of not being able to hear the current music."}}
{"Q": "The boy's hair was sticking up. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The girl ruffled it. (B) The girl pulled it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The girl ruffled it.\nExplanation: If the boy's hair was sticking up, it is more likely that someone ruffled it, which means they ran their fingers through it or messed it up playfully. Pulling someone's hair would likely result in a different appearance, such as a pulled or tangled look. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The bug got squashed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I sprayed myself with bug repellent. (B) I stepped on the bug.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I stepped on the bug.\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer because \"squashed\" implies that the bug was physically crushed, which is more likely to happen if someone steps on it rather than spraying themselves with bug repellent."}}
{"Q": "I opened my eyes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I woke up. (B) I relaxed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I woke up.\nExplanation: Opening one's eyes is a natural response to waking up from sleep. It is a common physiological response that occurs when the brain signals the body to become alert and conscious. On the other hand, relaxing may cause a person to close their eyes, but it is unlikely to be the direct cause of opening them. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My neighbor's music was blaring. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I asked him to turn it down. (B) I asked to borrow the CD from him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I asked him to turn it down.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person would ask their neighbor to turn down the music rather than asking to borrow the CD. Borrowing the CD would not solve the immediate problem of the loud music and may not be a priority for the person. Asking the neighbor to turn down the music is a more reasonable and practical solution to the noise disturbance."}}
{"Q": "The man's family lived in poverty. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was frugal with his earnings. (B) He earned below minimum wage.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He earned below minimum wage.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man earned below minimum wage, which is a common cause of poverty. Even if he was frugal with his earnings, it would be difficult to make ends meet if he was not earning enough to cover basic expenses."}}
{"Q": "The student graduated from the university. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He looked for a job. (B) He took up a hobby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He looked for a job.\nExplanation: Graduating from university usually marks the end of formal education and the beginning of a career. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student would start looking for a job after graduation rather than taking up a hobby. While the student may pursue hobbies in their free time, finding employment is typically a more pressing concern after completing a degree program."}}
{"Q": "The artist mixed yellow paint into blue paint. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The paint splattered everywhere. (B) The paint turned green.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The paint turned green.\nExplanation: When yellow paint is mixed with blue paint, it creates green paint. This is because yellow and blue are primary colors, and when they are mixed together, they create a secondary color, which is green. Therefore, it is more plausible that the paint turned green rather than splattering everywhere."}}
{"Q": "I changed the topic of conversation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I ran out of things to talk about. (B) The conversation became tense.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The conversation became tense.\nExplanation: Changing the topic of conversation is often a way to diffuse tension or avoid a potentially uncomfortable or sensitive subject. If the conversation had run out of things to talk about, it would be more likely that the conversation would simply come to a natural end rather than abruptly changing topics. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of changing the topic was due to tension in the conversation."}}
{"Q": "My brother was released from the hospital. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I welcomed him back home. (B) I gave him the cold shoulder.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I welcomed him back home.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the person would welcome their brother back home after being released from the hospital, rather than giving them the cold shoulder. It is a natural response to show concern and care for a loved one who has been through a difficult time."}}
{"Q": "The curtain on the stage went up. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The opening scene of the play began. (B) The actors in the play exited the stage.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The opening scene of the play began.\nExplanation: When the curtain on the stage goes up, it is usually an indication that the performance is about to begin. The opening scene of the play usually starts with the curtain going up, and the actors appearing on stage to start the performance. Therefore, it is more plausible that the opening scene of the play began as a result of the curtain going up. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not make sense for the actors to exit the stage when the curtain goes up, as they are supposed to perform on stage."}}
{"Q": "The hostage submitted to the kidnapper's mandates. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The kidnapper threatened to hurt the hostage. (B) The kidnapper left the hostage by himself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The kidnapper threatened to hurt the hostage.\nExplanation: The word \"submitted\" implies that the hostage gave in to the kidnapper's demands, which suggests that there was some sort of threat or coercion involved. Option A states that the kidnapper threatened to hurt the hostage, which is a plausible reason for the hostage's submission. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that the kidnapper left the hostage alone, which does not explain why the hostage would submit to the kidnapper's mandates."}}
{"Q": "A boom reverberated across the stage. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The musician tapped his foot. (B) The musician pounded the drum.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The musician pounded the drum.\nExplanation: A boom is a loud, deep sound, which is more likely to be produced by pounding a drum than tapping a foot. Additionally, the use of the word \"reverberated\" suggests that the sound was strong and echoed across the stage, which is more consistent with the forceful action of pounding a drum."}}
{"Q": "The parents rushed to their child's bedroom. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The child awoke screaming from a nightmare. (B) The child was scared to look under her bed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The child awoke screaming from a nightmare.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it is common for children to have nightmares and wake up screaming, causing their parents to rush to their bedroom to comfort them. On the other hand, being scared to look under the bed may not necessarily warrant such an urgent response from the parents."}}
{"Q": "The woman communicated with sign language. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was born premature. (B) She was born deaf.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She was born deaf.\nExplanation: Sign language is primarily used by individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to communicate with others. While premature birth can lead to a variety of health issues, it is not a direct cause of deafness. Therefore, it is more plausible that the woman communicated with sign language because she was born deaf."}}
{"Q": "A drought occurred in the region. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The water became contaminated. (B) The crops perished.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The crops perished.\nExplanation: During a drought, there is a lack of rainfall which leads to a shortage of water for crops. This can cause the crops to wither and die, resulting in a loss of food production and income for farmers. While water contamination can occur during a drought, it is not a direct result of the lack of rainfall."}}
{"Q": "The cat chased the bird. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bird flew away. (B) The bird caught a worm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The bird flew away.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the bird would fly away to escape from the cat rather than catching a worm while being chased."}}
{"Q": "The girl switched schools. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) School let out for the summer. (B) She moved to a new town.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She moved to a new town.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for a girl to switch schools is that she moved to a new town. If school let out for the summer, she would simply be on break and would return to the same school in the fall. Moving to a new town would require her to enroll in a new school."}}
{"Q": "The factory owner refused to raise employees' wages. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The owner appointed a new manager. (B) The employees went on strike.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The employees went on strike.\nExplanation: When the factory owner refuses to raise employees' wages, the employees may feel undervalued and may choose to take action. Going on strike is a common way for employees to protest against their employer's decision and demand better pay and working conditions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the employees went on strike rather than the owner appointing a new manager, as the latter does not address the issue of low wages."}}
{"Q": "The leader antagonized the extremists among his country. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The extremists influenced him. (B) The extremists assassinated him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The extremists assassinated him.\nExplanation: When a leader antagonizes extremists, it can lead to a violent response from them. In this case, the extremists may have felt threatened or provoked by the leader's actions, leading them to take extreme measures such as assassination. While it is possible that the extremists could have influenced the leader, it is less likely as the question states that the leader antagonized them, indicating a confrontational relationship rather than one of cooperation."}}
{"Q": "I walked barefoot on the beach. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sand stuck to my feet. (B) Waves crashed along the shore.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sand stuck to my feet.\nExplanation: When walking barefoot on the beach, it is likely that sand will stick to your feet due to the texture and composition of the sand. Waves crashing along the shore is a common occurrence at the beach, but it is not a direct result of walking barefoot. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I woke up in the middle of the night feeling cold. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I put sweatpants on. (B) I drank a glass of water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I put sweatpants on.\nExplanation: Feeling cold in the middle of the night is a common experience, especially during the winter months. Putting on warm clothing like sweatpants can help regulate body temperature and make you feel more comfortable. Drinking a glass of water may not necessarily help with feeling cold, unless you were dehydrated and feeling cold due to that reason. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The mother hushed her son. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her son smirked. (B) Her son whined.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Her son whined.\nExplanation: The word \"hushed\" implies that the mother wanted her son to be quiet. Smirking does not necessarily make noise, but whining does. Therefore, it is more likely that the mother hushed her son because he was whining."}}
{"Q": "A hole ripped in my jeans. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I zipped up the jeans. (B) I tripped on the pavement.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I tripped on the pavement.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the hole in the jeans was caused by a physical impact, such as tripping on the pavement, rather than by simply zipping up the jeans. Zipping up the jeans may cause a snag or a small tear, but it is unlikely to result in a large rip. On the other hand, tripping on the pavement can cause a significant tear in the fabric due to the force of the fall."}}
{"Q": "The boy wore braces. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got a cavity. (B) His teeth became straight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. His teeth became straight.\nExplanation: Braces are orthodontic devices used to straighten teeth and correct bite issues. Therefore, it is more plausible that wearing braces would result in straighter teeth rather than getting a cavity."}}
{"Q": "I worked out at the gym yesterday. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I woke up today with sore muscles. (B) I woke up today with a sore throat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: When you work out at the gym, it is common to experience muscle soreness the next day due to the strain on your muscles during the workout. Sore throat, on the other hand, is not a typical result of a gym workout unless you were exposed to germs or viruses at the gym. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl whispered back and forth to each other at the lunch table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Other students sat down at the lunch table. (B) Other students at the lunch table felt left out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Other students at the lunch table felt left out.\nExplanation: When the girl whispered back and forth to each other at the lunch table, it indicates that they were having a private conversation that excluded others. This behavior can make other students feel left out and excluded, leading to a negative social atmosphere at the lunch table. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The child landed on the trampoline. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She sprung back up into the air. (B) She decided to try to do a flip.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She sprung back up into the air.\nExplanation: When a child lands on a trampoline, the springs underneath the surface of the trampoline absorb the impact and propel the child back up into the air. This is a common and expected result of landing on a trampoline. Option B, where the child decides to try a flip, is not necessarily a direct result of landing on the trampoline and is more of a personal choice or decision."}}
{"Q": "I deposited the letter in the mailbox. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The post office delivered the letter. (B) The post office expedited the letter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The post office delivered the letter.\nExplanation: When a letter is deposited in a mailbox, it is collected by the postal service during their regular rounds. The letter is then sorted and delivered to its intended recipient. There is no indication that the letter was expedited, so option B is not a plausible answer. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "The gambler was confident. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bet all of his money. (B) He went home broke.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He bet all of his money.\nExplanation: When someone is confident in their gambling abilities, they may be more likely to take risks and bet larger amounts of money. This can lead to them betting all of their money, as they believe they will win. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B is also possible, but it is not necessarily the only outcome of the gambler's confidence."}}
{"Q": "The forest fire spread. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The winds became stronger. (B) The arsonists were apprehended.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The winds became stronger.\nExplanation: Forest fires can spread rapidly due to strong winds that carry the flames and embers to new areas. Arsonists may also start fires intentionally, but without evidence or context in the given sentence, it is more plausible to assume that the spread of the fire was due to natural causes such as wind."}}
{"Q": "The child skinned his knee. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mother sent him to his room. (B) His mother put a bandage on the wound.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His mother put a bandage on the wound.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the mother would attend to the child's injury by putting a bandage on the wound rather than punishing him by sending him to his room. Skinning a knee is a common injury for children and it is natural for a parent to provide first aid to their child."}}
{"Q": "The man survived the deadly illness. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He signed his will. (B) He received an organ transplant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He received an organ transplant.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the man had a deadly illness, which implies that he was suffering from a life-threatening condition. Signing a will would not have any direct impact on his survival. On the other hand, receiving an organ transplant could have saved his life by replacing a damaged or malfunctioning organ with a healthy one. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I took a sip of the scalding coffee. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I bit my tongue. (B) I burnt my tongue.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I burnt my tongue.\nExplanation: When you take a sip of scalding coffee, the high temperature of the liquid can cause burns to your tongue, mouth, and throat. This can result in pain, swelling, and difficulty eating or drinking. Biting your tongue is also a possibility, but it is less likely to occur than burning your tongue."}}
{"Q": "The editor fired the writer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The writer avoided bias in her stories. (B) The writer missed an important deadline.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The writer missed an important deadline.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the editor fired the writer, which implies that the writer did something wrong or failed to meet expectations. Option (B) is a more plausible answer as missing an important deadline is a serious offense in the writing industry and can lead to termination. Option (A) is not a likely cause for termination as avoiding bias in stories is a positive trait for a writer."}}
{"Q": "I felt exhausted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I slept all day. (B) I studied all day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I studied all day.\nExplanation: Studying for an extended period of time can be mentally and physically draining, leading to exhaustion. Sleeping all day, on the other hand, would typically result in feeling rested rather than exhausted. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The physician diagnosed the patient. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She identified the patient's symptoms. (B) She prescribed pills to the patient.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She identified the patient's symptoms.\nExplanation: The physician diagnosed the patient by identifying the patient's symptoms and determining the underlying medical condition causing those symptoms. Prescribing pills may be part of the treatment plan, but it is not the cause of the diagnosis."}}
{"Q": "I scratched my skin. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was sweaty. (B) It felt itchy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It felt itchy.\nExplanation: Scratching is a natural response to an itchy sensation on the skin. Itching can be caused by a variety of factors such as dry skin, insect bites, allergic reactions, or skin conditions like eczema. Sweating alone is not typically a direct cause of scratching, although it can contribute to skin irritation and make itching worse in some cases."}}
{"Q": "The man underwent emergency surgery. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He lost his temper. (B) He suffered a heart attack.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He suffered a heart attack.\nExplanation: A heart attack is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment, often through surgery. Losing one's temper may lead to high blood pressure or other health issues, but it is unlikely to require emergency surgery. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man's arm muscles bulged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He flexed his arms. (B) He rubbed his arms.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He flexed his arms.\nExplanation: When someone flexes their arms, their muscles contract and become more visible, causing them to bulge. Rubbing one's arms may cause temporary redness or warmth, but it would not cause visible muscle bulging. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man raised his eyebrows. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was surprised. (B) He felt discouraged.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was surprised.\nExplanation: Raising eyebrows is a common nonverbal cue that indicates surprise or disbelief. It is a natural reaction to unexpected or surprising information or events. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man raised his eyebrows because he was surprised rather than feeling discouraged."}}
{"Q": "I excused my colleague's blunder. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I believed his intentions were good. (B) I believed that he knew better.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I believed his intentions were good.\nExplanation: By excusing the colleague's blunder, it suggests that the mistake was not intentional and that the colleague had good intentions. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests that the colleague knew better but still made a mistake."}}
{"Q": "The man quit smoking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He began exercising more. (B) He started waking up earlier.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He began exercising more.\nExplanation: Quitting smoking often leads to an improvement in overall health and a desire to engage in healthier habits. Exercise is a common choice for individuals who quit smoking as it can help manage cravings and improve lung function. Waking up earlier is not necessarily a direct result of quitting smoking and is less likely to occur."}}
{"Q": "The woman punched her attacker in the nose. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The attacker's body went lifeless. (B) The attacker started to bleed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The attacker started to bleed.\nExplanation: When someone is punched in the nose, it is likely that they will start to bleed due to the sensitive and delicate nature of the nasal area. It is unlikely that the attacker's body would go lifeless from a single punch to the nose. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The dart missed the bull's eye. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man's aim was off. (B) The man was losing the game.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The man's aim was off.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the dart missing the bull's eye is that the man's aim was off. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as poor technique, lack of practice, or distractions in the environment. Option B, that the man was losing the game, is not a plausible explanation as missing the bull's eye does not necessarily mean the man is losing the game."}}
{"Q": "The homeowner requested that an exterminator come to his house. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He discovered rats in the basement. (B) He kept an ant farm in his room.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He discovered rats in the basement.\nExplanation: Rats are a common pest that can cause damage to a home and pose health risks to humans. Discovering rats in the basement would be a valid reason for a homeowner to request an exterminator. Keeping an ant farm in one's room would not typically require the services of an exterminator."}}
{"Q": "I suggested to my houseguest that we go out to dinner. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was too tired to prepare anything. (B) My houseguest overstayed her welcome.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that I was too tired to prepare anything. This is a common reason for suggesting going out to dinner, especially when hosting a guest. It is unlikely that the cause was that the houseguest overstayed her welcome, as this would be a rude and confrontational way to handle the situation."}}
{"Q": "The girl caught her brother reading her diary. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She started hiding the diary. (B) She got a new diary.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She started hiding the diary.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the girl would start hiding her diary after catching her brother reading it, rather than getting a new diary altogether. Hiding the diary would prevent her brother from accessing it again and protect her privacy. Getting a new diary may not necessarily solve the problem if her brother continues to snoop around."}}
{"Q": "The woman was short on money for rent. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She worked overtime. (B) She quit her job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) She worked overtime.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the woman would work overtime to earn extra money to pay for her rent rather than quitting her job, which would only worsen her financial situation. Working overtime is a common solution for people who need to make extra money quickly."}}
{"Q": "The child's hand quickly recoiled. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He touched the hot stove. (B) He patted the puppy's head.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He touched the hot stove.\nExplanation: The use of the word \"recoiled\" suggests a sudden and forceful movement away from something. Touching a hot stove would cause this type of reaction due to the pain and potential for injury. Patting a puppy's head would not typically cause a sudden and forceful recoil of the hand."}}
{"Q": "The company wanted to gauge customer satisfaction. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They offered a discount to new customers. (B) They distributed a survey to customers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They distributed a survey to customers.\nExplanation: Distributing a survey to customers is a common method used by companies to gauge customer satisfaction. It allows customers to provide feedback on their experience with the company's products or services, which can then be used to improve the customer experience. Offering a discount to new customers may attract new business, but it does not necessarily address the issue of customer satisfaction. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The wood floor became scratched. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boy threw the cushions off the couch. (B) The boy dragged a chair across the floor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The boy dragged a chair across the floor.\nExplanation: Dragging a chair across a wooden floor can cause scratches due to the friction between the chair legs and the floor surface. On the other hand, throwing cushions off the couch is less likely to cause scratches on the floor."}}
{"Q": "I shielded my face. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My enemy taunted me. (B) My enemy cocked a fist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) My enemy cocked a fist.\nExplanation: When someone cocks their fist, it is a clear indication that they are about to strike. Therefore, it is a natural instinct to shield one's face to protect themselves from the impending blow. In contrast, if someone taunts you, it may not necessarily warrant shielding your face unless there is a physical threat involved."}}
{"Q": "The famous statue burned down. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was struck by lightning. (B) People came to venerate it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was struck by lightning.\nExplanation: While it is possible for people to cause damage to a statue through vandalism or overcrowding, it is much more likely for a statue to be damaged or destroyed by natural causes such as lightning strikes. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I left the fruit out on the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fruit shed seeds. (B) Flies swarmed the fruit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Flies swarmed the fruit.\nExplanation: Leaving fruit out on the table can attract flies, especially if the fruit is ripe or starting to spoil. Flies are attracted to the sweet smell of fruit and can quickly swarm around it, making it unappetizing and potentially spreading bacteria. While some fruits may shed seeds over time, this is not a direct result of leaving them out on the table. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The ballerina tore a ligament. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She pointed her toes. (B) She twisted her ankle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She twisted her ankle.\nExplanation: Tearing a ligament is a common injury that occurs when a joint is forced beyond its normal range of motion. Twisting an ankle is a common cause of ligament tears, as the ligaments in the ankle are stretched and can tear when the foot is twisted in an unnatural direction. While pointing toes can cause strain on the muscles and tendons in the foot and ankle, it is less likely to cause a ligament tear compared to a sudden twisting motion."}}
{"Q": "The child's shoelaces came untied. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He learned how to tie them. (B) He ran around on the playground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He ran around on the playground.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the child's shoelaces came untied due to physical activity, such as running around on the playground, rather than simply learning how to tie them. When a person moves around, their shoes can shift and cause the laces to loosen and come undone."}}
{"Q": "I became enthralled in the book. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I returned the book. (B) I lost track of time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I lost track of time.\nExplanation: When someone becomes enthralled in a book, they are usually fully engaged in the story and may lose track of time. It is unlikely that they would return the book before finishing it, especially if they are enjoying it. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man held similar beliefs to those of his parents. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His parents influenced him. (B) His parents disowned him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His parents influenced him.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the man's beliefs were shaped by his parents' influence rather than being disowned by them. Children often adopt the beliefs and values of their parents, especially if they have a close relationship with them. Disownment, on the other hand, is a severe form of rejection that is less likely to result in the adoption of similar beliefs."}}
{"Q": "The car gradually slowed to a stop. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It ran out of gas. (B) The driver fell asleep.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It ran out of gas.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the car ran out of gas, as this is a common reason for a car to gradually slow to a stop. The other option, that the driver fell asleep, is less likely as it would result in a sudden stop rather than a gradual one. Additionally, if the driver had fallen asleep, it is possible that the car would have veered off the road or hit something before coming to a stop."}}
{"Q": "The man ate the ice cream in the sun. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The ice cream lost its flavor. (B) The ice cream dripped from the cone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The ice cream dripped from the cone.\nExplanation: When ice cream is exposed to the sun, it melts quickly due to the heat. As a result, it can drip from the cone and make a mess. This is a more plausible answer than (A) because the flavor of the ice cream is not affected by being in the sun."}}
{"Q": "I hung artwork in the room. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The carpet looked dirty. (B) The walls looked bare.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The walls looked bare.\nExplanation: The statement mentions hanging artwork in the room, which suggests that the reason for doing so was to add some decoration to the walls. Option (A) about the carpet looking dirty is not relevant to the action of hanging artwork on the walls. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I left work early. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had a headache. (B) My boss held a meeting.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) I had a headache.\nExplanation: Leaving work early due to a headache is a common and plausible reason. It is a physical ailment that can affect one's ability to work and requires rest or medical attention. On the other hand, leaving work early because of a meeting held by the boss is less likely as it is a regular occurrence in most workplaces and employees are expected to attend them."}}
{"Q": "The puppy soiled the carpet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The owner scolded the puppy. (B) The owner gave the puppy a treat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The owner scolded the puppy.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the owner would scold the puppy for soiling the carpet, as this behavior is undesirable and goes against the owner's expectations for the puppy's behavior. Giving the puppy a treat would not be an appropriate response to this situation."}}
{"Q": "I apologized to my friend. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My friend forgave me. (B) My friend became infuriated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My friend forgave me.\nExplanation: Apologizing is a way of acknowledging one's mistake and expressing regret for it. It shows that the person is willing to take responsibility for their actions and make amends. In most cases, when someone apologizes to a friend, the friend is likely to forgive them and move on. It helps to restore trust and strengthen the relationship. While there may be instances where the friend may not forgive immediately, it is unlikely that they would become infuriated unless the apology was insincere or the offense was severe."}}
{"Q": "The man stood out in the crowd. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He carried a backpack. (B) He wore a neon vest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He wore a neon vest.\nExplanation: Wearing a neon vest is more likely to make someone stand out in a crowd than carrying a backpack. A neon vest is a bright and attention-grabbing piece of clothing that is often worn by construction workers, road workers, and other people who work in hazardous environments. It is designed to make the wearer visible and easily identifiable, which is why it would cause the man to stand out in a crowd. On the other hand, carrying a backpack is a common activity that many people do, and it is unlikely to make someone stand out in a crowd."}}
{"Q": "The witness lied under oath. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He completed his testimony. (B) He was charged with perjury.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was charged with perjury.\nExplanation: Lying under oath is a serious offense and is considered perjury. Therefore, the witness would likely face legal consequences, such as being charged with perjury. Option A is not a plausible answer as completing the testimony does not absolve the witness of the crime committed."}}
{"Q": "The woman dyed her hair. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She wanted a new look. (B) She wanted to blend in.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She wanted a new look.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the woman dyed her hair, which implies that she made a deliberate choice to change her hair color. The phrase \"wanted a new look\" suggests that she was seeking a change in her appearance, which is a common reason for dyeing one's hair. On the other hand, the option \"wanted to blend in\" does not seem to fit the context, as dyeing one's hair to blend in with others would require knowing what the others look like and what hair color they have."}}
{"Q": "The immigrants were caught illegally residing in the country. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They found employment. (B) They were deported.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They were deported.\nExplanation: When immigrants are caught residing illegally in a country, the usual consequence is deportation. This means that they are forced to leave the country and return to their home country. Finding employment is not a likely outcome as they would not have legal status to work in the country."}}
{"Q": "The public speaker cracked a joke. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The audience laughed. (B) The audience stood up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The audience laughed.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the audience would laugh in response to a joke made by a public speaker, as laughter is a common reaction to humor. Standing up would be a less likely response, unless the joke was particularly inspiring or motivational."}}
{"Q": "I looked into the sun. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sun blinded me. (B) The sun tanned my skin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The sun blinded me.\nExplanation: Looking directly into the sun can cause temporary or permanent damage to the retina, which is the part of the eye responsible for vision. This can result in a condition called solar retinopathy, which can cause blurred vision, blind spots, and even permanent vision loss. Therefore, it is not plausible that looking into the sun would result in tanning of the skin, but it is plausible that it could cause temporary or permanent blindness."}}
{"Q": "I felt bored. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I snorted. (B) I yawned.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I yawned.\nExplanation: Yawning is a common physiological response to boredom, fatigue, or drowsiness. It is a reflex action that helps to increase oxygen intake and blood flow to the brain, which can help to alleviate feelings of boredom or tiredness. Snorting, on the other hand, is not a typical response to boredom and is more commonly associated with drug use or allergies. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The steak was difficult to cut. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The knife was dull. (B) The steak was raw.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The knife was dull.\nExplanation: A dull knife can make it difficult to cut through meat, as it requires more force and pressure to slice through. On the other hand, a raw steak would be tender and easy to cut, but may not be safe to eat. Therefore, the most plausible cause of the difficulty in cutting the steak is a dull knife."}}
{"Q": "The woman declared bankruptcy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She received alimony payment. (B) She acquired massive debt.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She acquired massive debt.\nExplanation: Bankruptcy is usually declared when a person or business is unable to pay off their debts. Therefore, it is more plausible that the woman declared bankruptcy due to acquiring massive debt rather than receiving alimony payments, which are typically meant to support a person's financial stability."}}
{"Q": "The lights in my friend's apartment were on. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I wondered if he was out. (B) I decided to pay him a visit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I wondered if he was out.\nExplanation: Seeing the lights on in your friend's apartment does not necessarily mean that they are home and available for a visit. It is more plausible to assume that they may be out and left the lights on for security reasons or forgot to turn them off before leaving. Therefore, it is more reasonable to wonder if they are out rather than immediately deciding to pay them a visit."}}
{"Q": "I put the flower under my nose. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The petals came off the flower. (B) I picked up the flower's scent.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I picked up the flower's scent.\nExplanation: When you put a flower under your nose, you are likely to inhale its fragrance or scent. This is because flowers release volatile organic compounds that can be detected by our sense of smell. It is unlikely that the petals would come off the flower just by putting it under your nose, unless you were handling it roughly or the flower was already damaged. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman felt nostalgic. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She ran into a childhood friend. (B) She yelled at her children.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She ran into a childhood friend.\nExplanation: Nostalgia is a feeling of longing or wistfulness for a past time or experience. Running into a childhood friend can trigger memories and emotions associated with that time period, leading to feelings of nostalgia. Yelling at her children would not likely cause feelings of nostalgia."}}
{"Q": "The student procrastinated on the paper. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He submitted the paper early. (B) He submitted the paper incomplete.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He submitted the paper incomplete.\nExplanation: Procrastination often leads to rushing and incomplete work. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student submitted an incomplete paper rather than submitting it early."}}
{"Q": "My car broke down. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I went to the mall. (B) I called a mechanic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I called a mechanic.\nExplanation: When a car breaks down, the most logical and practical solution is to call a mechanic to diagnose and fix the problem. Going to the mall would not solve the issue with the car."}}
{"Q": "I discarded the note. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was anonymous. (B) It was illegible.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It was illegible.\nExplanation: The word \"illegible\" means difficult or impossible to read. If the note was illegible, it would be understandable why the person discarded it. On the other hand, if the note was anonymous, it doesn't necessarily mean that the person would discard it. It could still contain important information or a message that the person would want to know. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The bird flapped its wings. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It laid eggs. (B) It ascended upwards.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It ascended upwards.\nExplanation: Flapping wings is a common behavior of birds to generate lift and propel themselves upwards. Therefore, it is more plausible that the bird ascended upwards as a result of flapping its wings rather than laying eggs."}}
{"Q": "I parked in the driveway. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The garage was open. (B) The garage was full.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The garage was full.\nExplanation: If the garage was open, there would be no reason to park in the driveway instead of the garage. Therefore, it is more plausible that the garage was full and there was no space to park inside."}}
{"Q": "The criminal aimed the gun at his victim. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The criminal put down the gun. (B) The victim put his hands up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The victim put his hands up.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the victim would react to the threat of a gun by putting his hands up in a defensive gesture, rather than the criminal suddenly deciding to put down the weapon. This is a common response in situations where someone is being threatened with a gun."}}
{"Q": "I looked forward to the weekend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I planned to attend my uncle's funeral. (B) I planned to attend my friend's wedding.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cause of looking forward to the weekend is attending a friend's wedding, which is typically a happy and exciting event, rather than attending a funeral, which is typically a sad and somber event."}}
{"Q": "I lost track of time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was daydreaming. (B) I was nauseous.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I was daydreaming.\nExplanation: Daydreaming is a common cause of losing track of time. When we are lost in our thoughts, we tend to lose awareness of our surroundings and the passage of time. On the other hand, feeling nauseous may cause us to be more aware of time passing as we may be focused on when we will feel better or when we can take medication. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The document printed out illegibly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The printer was low on ink. (B) The print was out of paper.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The printer was low on ink.\nExplanation: If the document printed out illegibly, it is more likely that the printer was low on ink rather than out of paper. When a printer runs low on ink, the text or images may appear faded, streaky, or incomplete. On the other hand, if the printer is out of paper, the document would not print at all. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The stadium played the national anthem. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fans turned to the flag. (B) The fans rushed the field.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The fans turned to the flag.\nExplanation: It is a common practice for fans to stand and face the flag while the national anthem is being played as a sign of respect and patriotism. Rushing the field would be an unlikely response to the national anthem being played."}}
{"Q": "The dip tasted bland. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I served it. (B) I put salt in it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I put salt in it.\nExplanation: If the dip tasted bland, it is likely that it needed more seasoning, such as salt. Therefore, adding salt would be a plausible solution to improve the taste of the dip. Serving it without any adjustments would not address the issue of blandness."}}
{"Q": "I set the paper towel on the spill. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The towel absorbed the liquid. (B) The spill left a sticky residue.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The towel absorbed the liquid.\nExplanation: Paper towels are designed to absorb liquids, so it is more plausible that the towel absorbed the spill rather than leaving a sticky residue. Additionally, if the spill was left on the surface without being cleaned up, it could potentially leave a sticky residue, but placing a paper towel on top of it would not cause this to happen."}}
{"Q": "The woman was interrupted in the midst of reading her book. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She bookmarked her page. (B) She reread the book.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She bookmarked her page.\nExplanation: When someone is interrupted while reading a book, the most plausible response would be to bookmark the page they were on so they can easily pick up where they left off. Rereading the entire book would be an unlikely and time-consuming response to being interrupted. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The plane hit some turbulence. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man tightened his seatbelt. (B) The man looked out the window.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The man tightened his seatbelt.\nExplanation: When a plane hits turbulence, it can cause sudden and unexpected movements that can be dangerous for passengers who are not properly secured. Therefore, it is important to tighten the seatbelt to ensure safety. Looking out the window may not be a priority during such a situation."}}
{"Q": "The boy flinched. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The girl ignored him. (B) The girl poked him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The girl poked him.\nExplanation: Flinching is a natural reaction to sudden physical contact or pain. Therefore, it is more plausible that the boy flinched because the girl poked him, rather than simply ignoring him."}}
{"Q": "The doctors gave the patient an artificial limb. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They amputated her leg. (B) They monitored her vitals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They amputated her leg.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the patient had a condition or injury that required amputation of her leg, and the doctors provided her with an artificial limb as a replacement. Monitoring vitals would not typically lead to the need for an artificial limb."}}
{"Q": "The boy pinched the girl's elbow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She shrugged her shoulders at him. (B) She jerked her arm away from him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She jerked her arm away from him.\nExplanation: Pinching someone's elbow is a physical action that can cause discomfort or pain. It is a natural reaction for someone to jerk their arm away from the person who pinched them in order to avoid further discomfort. Shrugging one's shoulders would not be a typical response to being pinched on the elbow."}}
{"Q": "I asked my friend for advice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I valued his opinion. (B) I knew I was right.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: The fact that the person asked their friend for advice suggests that they value their friend's opinion and are seeking guidance or input from someone they trust. Option B, on the other hand, implies that the person is not open to other perspectives and is confident in their own beliefs, which would not lead them to seek advice from someone else."}}
{"Q": "The boy stepped in mud. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The mud stuck to his shoes. (B) The mud hit him in the face.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The mud stuck to his shoes.\nExplanation: When someone steps in mud, it is more likely that the mud will stick to their shoes rather than hit them in the face. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The town received several inches of snow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Schools shut down. (B) People hid underground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Schools shut down.\nExplanation: It is common for schools to shut down in areas that receive several inches of snow due to safety concerns for students and staff traveling to and from school. People hiding underground is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the situation of snowfall."}}
{"Q": "The employee's shift ended. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He went home for the day. (B) He threatened to quit the job.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He went home for the day.\nExplanation: It is a common and expected outcome for an employee's shift to end and for them to go home for the day. Option B, where the employee threatens to quit the job, is not a likely outcome unless there are other factors involved. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The tree damaged the house. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The tree fell onto the roof. (B) The tree shaded the backyard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The tree fell onto the roof.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the tree caused damage to the house by falling onto the roof rather than simply shading the backyard. Falling trees are a common cause of property damage during storms or high winds."}}
{"Q": "The wood split in half. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I stacked the wood in the fireplace. (B) I swung the axe down to the wood.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I swung the axe down to the wood.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the wood split in half due to the force of the axe being swung down onto it, rather than simply being stacked in the fireplace."}}
{"Q": "The family congratulated the couple. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The couple announced that they were separating. (B) The couple announced that they were having a baby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The couple announced that they were having a baby.\nExplanation: It is common for families to congratulate a couple when they announce that they are expecting a baby. On the other hand, if the couple announced that they were separating, it is unlikely that the family would congratulate them. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl sent the boy a valentine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She liked him. (B) She kissed him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She liked him.\nExplanation: Sending someone a valentine is typically a way of expressing romantic interest or affection. While kissing someone could also be a sign of attraction, it is not necessarily related to the act of sending a valentine. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I nodded my head at my friend's statement. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was confused. (B) I agreed with him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I agreed with him.\nExplanation: When someone nods their head, it is usually a nonverbal way of indicating agreement or affirmation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of nodding in this scenario is agreement with the friend's statement rather than confusion."}}
{"Q": "The friends flipped a coin. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They wanted to find a compromise. (B) They wanted to make a fair decision.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They wanted to make a fair decision.\nExplanation: Flipping a coin is a common way to make a fair decision when there are two options and both parties have equal chances of winning. It is often used to settle disputes or make a choice when there is no clear preference. Therefore, it is more plausible that the friends flipped a coin to make a fair decision rather than to find a compromise."}}
{"Q": "The timer in the kitchen went off. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The man unloaded the groceries into the refrigerator. (B) The man took the pizza out of the oven.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The man took the pizza out of the oven.\nExplanation: The timer in the kitchen is usually set to remind the person cooking that the food is ready. In this case, since the timer went off, it is more plausible that the man took the pizza out of the oven as it would have been ready to eat. Unloading groceries into the refrigerator would not be affected by the timer going off."}}
{"Q": "The woman set an ambitious goal. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She slacked off. (B) She worked hard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She worked hard.\nExplanation: If the woman set an ambitious goal, it is more likely that she would work hard to achieve it rather than slack off. Ambitious goals require dedication and effort to accomplish, so it is reasonable to assume that the woman would work hard to reach her goal."}}
{"Q": "The wealthy man died of old age. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His son got into legal trouble. (B) His son inherited his fortune.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His son inherited his fortune.\nExplanation: It is a common practice for wealthy individuals to leave their fortune to their heirs after their death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the wealthy man's son inherited his fortune rather than getting into legal trouble."}}
{"Q": "The woman stomped on the flames. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The flames went out. (B) Smoke arose from the flames.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The flames went out.\nExplanation: When someone stomps on flames, the lack of oxygen and the pressure from the stomping can extinguish the fire. Therefore, it is more plausible that the flames went out rather than smoke arising from the flames."}}
{"Q": "The woman's car was in the shop. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her driver's license was revoked. (B) She got in a car accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She got in a car accident.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as car accidents are a common reason for cars to be in the shop for repairs. On the other hand, having a revoked driver's license would prevent the woman from driving altogether, so it would not be the cause of her car being in the shop."}}
{"Q": "I slept through my alarm. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I made breakfast. (B) I missed breakfast.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I missed breakfast.\nExplanation: If you slept through your alarm, it means you woke up later than intended. As a result, you would have less time to get ready and may have missed breakfast."}}
{"Q": "The public figure got out of the limousine. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cameras flashed in his direction. (B) His family attended the press conference.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cameras flashed in his direction.\nExplanation: It is more likely that cameras would flash in the direction of a public figure getting out of a limousine, as this is a common occurrence during public appearances or events. It is less likely that his family would attend a press conference simply because he got out of a limousine."}}
{"Q": "The woman lingered in the bathtub. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bathwater became lukewarm. (B) The bathwater drained out of the tub.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The bathwater became lukewarm.\nExplanation: When someone lingers in a bathtub, the water tends to cool down gradually. Therefore, it is more plausible that the bathwater became lukewarm as a result of the woman lingering in the bathtub. Option B, which suggests that the bathwater drained out of the tub, is less likely as it does not necessarily follow from the given information."}}
{"Q": "The college student wanted to meet other students on campus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He joined a fraternity. (B) He majored in engineering.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He joined a fraternity.\nExplanation: Joining a fraternity is a common way for college students to meet other students on campus. Fraternities often have social events and activities that allow members to interact and form friendships. Majoring in engineering, on the other hand, is not directly related to meeting other students on campus. While engineering students may have opportunities to collaborate with their peers on projects, it is not a guaranteed way to meet new people."}}
{"Q": "I lifted up the couch cushions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was looking for loose change. (B) I was rearranging the living room.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: The most plausible reason for lifting up couch cushions is to look for loose change. It is a common practice for people to check under cushions for lost coins or other small items. Rearranging the living room may involve moving furniture around, but it is unlikely to involve lifting up couch cushions specifically."}}
{"Q": "The wasp flew towards the boy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The boy ran away. (B) The boy picked a flower.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The boy ran away.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy would run away from the wasp as it is a natural instinct to avoid getting stung. Picking a flower would not be a likely response to a wasp flying towards someone."}}
{"Q": "The woman was found guilty of a misdemeanor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was sentenced to perform community service. (B) She was put on death row.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was sentenced to perform community service.\nExplanation: A misdemeanor is a less serious crime than a felony, and typically carries a punishment of a fine, probation, or community service. Death row is reserved for the most serious crimes, such as murder, and would not be a plausible punishment for a misdemeanor. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I stirred the sugar into the hot tea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The tea steamed. (B) The sugar dissolved.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The sugar dissolved.\nExplanation: When sugar is stirred into hot tea, it dissolves due to the heat and agitation. The sugar molecules break down and mix with the tea molecules, creating a homogeneous mixture. The tea may steam as well, but that is not a direct result of stirring in the sugar. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The veteran walked with a limp. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was drafted for the war. (B) He was injured in battle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He was injured in battle.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the veteran's limp was caused by an injury sustained during battle rather than simply being drafted for the war. Many soldiers suffer injuries during combat that can result in long-term physical disabilities, such as limps."}}
{"Q": "The criminal ran away from the police. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The police attended to the victim. (B) The police chased the criminal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The police chased the criminal.\nExplanation: Since the criminal ran away from the police, it is likely that the police would chase after the criminal in an attempt to apprehend them. Option A, where the police attend to the victim, is not a likely outcome as there is no mention of a victim in the given statement. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The laptop wouldn't turn on. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I dropped it. (B) I charged it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I charged it.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the laptop wouldn't turn on because it was not charged or the battery was dead. Dropping the laptop may cause physical damage, but it does not necessarily prevent it from turning on."}}
{"Q": "The woman ran out of room in her closet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She acquired an extensive wardrobe. (B) She folded her laundry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She acquired an extensive wardrobe.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the woman ran out of room in her closet, which implies that she has too many clothes to fit in the space available. Option A, which suggests that she acquired an extensive wardrobe, is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests that she folded her laundry. Folding laundry would not necessarily cause a shortage of space in the closet, unless the woman had so much laundry that it added to her already extensive wardrobe."}}
{"Q": "The man was heartbroken. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His wife gave birth. (B) His wife left him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. His wife left him.\nExplanation: The phrase \"heartbroken\" typically refers to a deep emotional pain caused by a loss or rejection. In this case, the most plausible reason for the man's heartbreak would be his wife leaving him, rather than giving birth. While the birth of a child can certainly be an emotional event, it is not typically associated with the intense sadness and despair that comes with heartbreak. On the other hand, a spouse leaving can be a devastating experience that can leave a person feeling shattered and heartbroken."}}
{"Q": "The man obtained a degree. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He became qualified for the job he wanted. (B) His job offer was rescinded.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He became qualified for the job he wanted.\nExplanation: Obtaining a degree typically increases a person's qualifications and makes them more competitive in the job market. It is unlikely that a job offer would be rescinded simply because someone obtained a degree, unless there were other factors involved. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man's voice projected clearly throughout the auditorium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He greeted the audience. (B) He spoke into the microphone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He spoke into the microphone.\nExplanation: The use of a microphone amplifies the sound of the speaker's voice, making it louder and clearer for the audience to hear. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man's clear projection was due to him speaking into the microphone rather than simply greeting the audience."}}
{"Q": "I tossed a coin into the fountain of water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The coin sunk to the bottom. (B) The coin broke in half.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The coin sunk to the bottom.\nExplanation: When a coin is tossed into a fountain of water, it is likely to sink to the bottom due to the force of gravity. The water may also create some resistance, but it is not enough to break the coin in half. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The player hit the ball toward the hole. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The ball went in the hole. (B) The ball retreated back to the player.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The ball went in the hole.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the ball went in the hole as hitting the ball towards the hole is the objective of the game of golf. The ball retreating back to the player would be an unlikely outcome unless there was some sort of obstruction or error in the shot."}}
{"Q": "I breathed in the dust in the attic. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I hiccupped. (B) I sneezed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I sneezed.\nExplanation: Breathing in dust can irritate the nasal passages and cause sneezing as a reflex to expel the irritants. Hiccups are not a common reaction to inhaling dust."}}
{"Q": "The store cashier called security. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The customer used counterfeit money. (B) The customer left his headlights on.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The customer used counterfeit money.\nExplanation: The use of counterfeit money is a serious offense and can result in legal consequences. It is a plausible reason for the store cashier to call security to handle the situation. On the other hand, leaving headlights on is a minor issue that can be easily resolved without the need for security intervention."}}
{"Q": "I took the garbage out. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The garbage made the kitchen smell bad. (B) I accidentally threw away my shopping list.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the garbage made the kitchen smell bad, which prompted the person to take it out. It is unlikely that accidentally throwing away a shopping list would be the sole reason for taking out the garbage."}}
{"Q": "The family went to the zoo. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The children admired the animals. (B) The children chased the animals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The children admired the animals.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the children would admire the animals at the zoo rather than chase them. Zoos are designed for visitors to observe and learn about animals in a safe and controlled environment. Chasing the animals would not only be dangerous for the children but also disruptive to the animals' well-being. Therefore, it is more plausible that the children would admire the animals at the zoo."}}
{"Q": "The man's breathing was loud. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His kidneys were failing. (B) His lungs were congested.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His lungs were congested.\nExplanation: Loud breathing is often a symptom of congested or obstructed airways, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as allergies, infections, or lung diseases. Kidney failure, on the other hand, is unlikely to directly cause loud breathing unless it is accompanied by fluid buildup in the lungs. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I had an extra ticket for the concert. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I asked my friend for directions to the venue. (B) I asked my friend if he was interested in going.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I asked my friend if he was interested in going.\nExplanation: Since the statement mentions having an extra ticket for the concert, it is more plausible that the person would ask a friend if they were interested in going rather than asking for directions to the venue."}}
{"Q": "The air conditioner in the house broke. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I brought out blankets. (B) I opened the windows.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I opened the windows.\nExplanation: When the air conditioner in the house breaks, the temperature inside the house will rise. Opening the windows will allow fresh air to circulate and cool down the house. Bringing out blankets would not be a logical solution to a broken air conditioner as it would only make the house warmer."}}
{"Q": "The boy's back ached. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His backpack was open. (B) His backpack was heavy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His backpack was heavy.\nExplanation: Carrying a heavy backpack for an extended period can cause back pain, especially if the weight is not distributed evenly or the backpack is not adjusted properly. On the other hand, an open backpack may cause items to shift and create discomfort, but it is less likely to cause significant back pain. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I bought my mother a present. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I baked her a cake. (B) It was her birthday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It was her birthday.\nExplanation: Buying a present for someone is a common practice on their birthday, so it is more plausible that the cause of buying a present for the mother was her birthday rather than baking her a cake."}}
{"Q": "The daffodils in the garden were destroyed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A bee stung the gardener. (B) Squirrels dug up the bulbs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Squirrels dug up the bulbs.\nExplanation: Squirrels are known to dig up bulbs, especially in the fall when they are storing food for the winter. Daffodil bulbs are a common target for squirrels, as they are easy to dig up and provide a good source of nutrients. On the other hand, a bee sting would not have any direct impact on the daffodils in the garden."}}
{"Q": "I struck the match. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The flame faded out. (B) The match produced a flame.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The match produced a flame.\nExplanation: When a match is struck, the friction between the match head and the striking surface creates heat, which ignites the chemicals on the match head and produces a flame. Therefore, it is more plausible that the match produced a flame rather than the flame fading out."}}
{"Q": "The disputing parties reached a settlement. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They didn't want to debate in court. (B) They wanted to repair their personal relationship.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) They didn't want to debate in court.\nExplanation: The fact that the parties reached a settlement suggests that they were able to come to an agreement outside of court. This implies that they did not want to go through the time, expense, and uncertainty of a court battle. It is possible that they also wanted to avoid the negative publicity that can come with a public legal dispute. While repairing their personal relationship may have been a factor, it is less likely to be the primary cause of the settlement."}}
{"Q": "The children were sent to an orphanage. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their parents died. (B) Their parents spoiled them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Their parents died.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it is common for children to be sent to an orphanage if their parents have passed away and there are no other family members or guardians who can take care of them. On the other hand, it is unlikely for children to be sent to an orphanage simply because their parents spoiled them."}}
{"Q": "A meteorite landed in the ocean. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A tsunami occurred. (B) It began to hail.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A tsunami occurred.\nExplanation: When a meteorite lands in the ocean, it can create a large impact crater and cause a massive displacement of water. This displacement can result in a tsunami, which is a series of ocean waves with very long wavelengths and high speeds that can cause significant damage to coastal areas. Hail, on the other hand, is a type of precipitation that forms in thunderstorm clouds and falls to the ground as small, round pellets of ice. It is not related to meteorite impacts in the ocean."}}
{"Q": "The hiker encountered a poisonous snake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She became dehydrated. (B) She panicked.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She panicked.\nExplanation: When encountering a poisonous snake, it is common for people to experience fear and panic. This is a natural response to a potentially life-threatening situation. Becoming dehydrated would not be a direct result of encountering a snake, unless the hiker was already in a situation where they were lacking water. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The oven became hot. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I turned the oven on. (B) I put the dish in the oven.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I turned the oven on.\nExplanation: The most plausible cause of the oven becoming hot is that it was turned on. Turning on the oven is the direct action that leads to the heating up of the oven. Putting a dish in the oven may contribute to the oven becoming hotter, but it is not the initial cause of the oven becoming hot."}}
{"Q": "I squeezed the lemon wedge. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The lemon got moldy. (B) The lemon squirted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The lemon squirted.\nExplanation: When you squeeze a lemon wedge, the pressure applied to the lemon causes the juice to be released, resulting in the lemon squirting. Mold growth is not a direct result of squeezing a lemon wedge."}}
{"Q": "The country discovered new land. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The country abandoned the land. (B) The country colonized the land.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The country colonized the land.\nExplanation: When a country discovers new land, it is more likely that they will try to establish their presence and claim ownership over it. This often leads to colonization, where the country sends people to settle and develop the land. Abandoning the land would not make sense as it would be a wasted opportunity for the country to expand its territory and resources. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The glass toppled off the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It shattered all over the floor. (B) It landed in a pile of laundry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It shattered all over the floor.\nExplanation: When a glass topples off a table, it is likely to break if it falls on a hard surface like the floor. Glass is fragile and can easily shatter into pieces upon impact. Therefore, it is more plausible that the glass shattered all over the floor rather than landing in a pile of laundry, which would require a specific set of circumstances."}}
{"Q": "The table wobbled. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The floor was uneven. (B) The floor was slippery.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The floor was uneven.\nExplanation: An uneven floor can cause a table to wobble as it creates an unstable surface for the table legs to rest on. On the other hand, a slippery floor may cause the table to slide, but it is less likely to cause wobbling. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The father caught his son lying. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His son confessed the truth. (B) The father trusted his son.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His son confessed the truth.\nExplanation: When someone is caught lying, it is more likely that they will confess the truth rather than being trusted immediately. Confessing the truth is a way to regain trust and show remorse for their actions. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man's head throbbed with pain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He took cough syrup. (B) He took aspirin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He took aspirin.\nExplanation: Aspirin is a common pain reliever that is often used to treat headaches. Since the man's head is throbbing with pain, it is more plausible that he would take aspirin rather than cough syrup, which is used to treat coughs and other respiratory symptoms."}}
{"Q": "The train slowed down. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was approaching the station. (B) It was running behind schedule.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was approaching the station.\nExplanation: Trains typically slow down as they approach a station to prepare for stopping and allowing passengers to board and disembark. Running behind schedule may cause a train to speed up in order to make up time, rather than slowing down. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man went through therapy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mental illness ran in his family. (B) He was diagnosed with depression.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was diagnosed with depression.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the man went through therapy, which suggests that he sought treatment for a specific issue. While mental illness may run in his family, it is not specified in the sentence that this was the cause of his therapy. On the other hand, being diagnosed with depression is a common reason for seeking therapy, making it a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman clutched her throat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She swallowed her food. (B) She choked on her food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She choked on her food.\nExplanation: The act of clutching one's throat is a common sign of choking, which occurs when food or other objects become lodged in the airway and obstruct breathing. Swallowing food, on the other hand, is a normal bodily function that does not typically cause discomfort or distress. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "The woman had a sore throat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her voice sounded raspy. (B) She spoke with an accent.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her voice sounded raspy.\nExplanation: A sore throat can cause inflammation and irritation in the vocal cords, leading to a hoarse or raspy voice. Speaking with an accent is not a common result of a sore throat."}}
{"Q": "The dog eyed the juicy steak on the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It drooled. (B) It laid down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It drooled.\nExplanation: Dogs are known to drool when they see or smell food that they want. This is a natural response to the anticipation of eating. Laying down may be a possible reaction, but it is less likely than drooling. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman's business succeeded. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She fired her employees. (B) She became wealthy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She became wealthy.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a successful business would result in the owner becoming wealthy rather than firing employees. Success in business usually means increased profits and growth, which can lead to financial success for the owner."}}
{"Q": "The students exited the classroom. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bell rang. (B) The teacher assigned homework.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The bell rang.\nExplanation: The most common reason for students to exit a classroom is when the bell rings, indicating the end of the class period. It is less likely that the teacher assigning homework would cause all the students to leave the classroom at the same time. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman claimed she saw a ghost. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her acquaintances expressed skepticism. (B) Her acquaintances related to her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her acquaintances expressed skepticism.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the woman's claim of seeing a ghost would be met with skepticism rather than empathy or belief. Many people are skeptical of paranormal experiences and may question the validity of the woman's claim. Therefore, it is more plausible that her acquaintances expressed skepticism in response to her claim."}}
{"Q": "The man lost his hearing. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He nearly drowned in the ocean. (B) He was nearly killed in an explosion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man lost his hearing due to being nearly killed in an explosion. Explosions can cause damage to the ears and result in hearing loss, while nearly drowning in the ocean may cause other health issues but is less likely to directly cause hearing loss."}}
{"Q": "The child let go of the balloon string. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The balloon deflated. (B) The balloon rose into the air.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The balloon rose into the air.\nExplanation: When a balloon is released, it rises into the air due to the buoyancy of the helium gas inside it. The balloon does not deflate immediately unless it is punctured or damaged in some way. Therefore, it is more plausible that the balloon rose into the air when the child let go of the string."}}
{"Q": "The man lost his ability to speak. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He had a stroke. (B) He took a deep breath.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He had a stroke.\nExplanation: A stroke is a medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced, causing brain cells to die. Depending on the area of the brain affected, a stroke can cause various symptoms, including loss of speech. On the other hand, taking a deep breath is unlikely to cause a loss of speech. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman tripped on the sidewalk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There was a crack in the cement. (B) She heard her name being called.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There was a crack in the cement.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the woman tripped on the sidewalk due to a crack in the cement rather than hearing her name being called. Hearing her name being called would not directly cause her to trip, whereas a crack in the cement could easily cause someone to stumble and fall."}}
{"Q": "The man did a canon ball into the pool. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The lifeguard jumped in after him. (B) The man soaked the lifeguard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The man soaked the lifeguard.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man's cannonball caused a big splash and soaked the lifeguard, rather than the lifeguard immediately jumping in after him. Jumping in without assessing the situation could be dangerous and against lifeguard protocol."}}
{"Q": "I took antibiotics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My infection cleared up. (B) My infection spread.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My infection cleared up.\nExplanation: Antibiotics are medications that are used to treat bacterial infections. When taken as prescribed, antibiotics can help to kill the bacteria causing the infection and clear up the infection. Therefore, it is more plausible that taking antibiotics would result in the clearing up of the infection rather than the spreading of the infection. However, it is important to note that antibiotics do not work against viral infections, such as the common cold or flu."}}
{"Q": "The traffic light turned yellow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The driver pushed the brake. (B) The driver honked his horn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The driver pushed the brake.\nExplanation: When the traffic light turns yellow, it indicates that the signal is about to turn red. Therefore, a responsible driver would slow down and prepare to stop. The most plausible action in this situation would be to push the brake pedal to slow down the vehicle and stop safely before the light turns red. Honking the horn would not be a necessary or appropriate response in this situation."}}
{"Q": "The plastic container melted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I soaked the container in warm water. (B) I placed the container on the hot stove.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Placing the plastic container on a hot stove would generate enough heat to melt the plastic. On the other hand, soaking the container in warm water would not generate enough heat to melt the plastic. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The car got dented. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The driver hit a telephone pole. (B) The driver ran a red light.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The driver hit a telephone pole.\nExplanation: A dent in a car is more likely to be caused by a collision with a stationary object like a telephone pole than by running a red light, which would typically result in a more severe accident with greater damage to the car."}}
{"Q": "The boy studied all night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He skipped the exam. (B) He passed the exam.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He passed the exam.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the boy passed the exam as a result of studying all night. Studying for an extended period of time can improve one's understanding and retention of the material, leading to better performance on the exam. Skipping the exam would not be a logical outcome of studying all night."}}
{"Q": "The young boy clung to the ledge of the pool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He feared learning to swim. (B) The lifeguard was on duty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He feared learning to swim.\nExplanation: The fact that the young boy is clinging to the ledge of the pool suggests that he is afraid of being in the water. This fear could be due to a lack of experience or a previous negative experience in the water. The presence of a lifeguard does not necessarily explain why the boy is clinging to the ledge."}}
{"Q": "I put my hand to my chest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I felt my heartbeat. (B) My heart rate sped up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: When you put your hand to your chest, you are likely to feel your heartbeat. This is because the heart is located in the chest and the beating of the heart can be felt through the chest wall. It is unlikely that your heart rate would speed up just from placing your hand on your chest, as this would require a more significant stimulus or trigger."}}
{"Q": "The building adjacent to my office was under construction. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My office was crowded. (B) My office was noisy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. My office was noisy.\nExplanation: Construction work is usually associated with loud noises from machinery, drilling, hammering, and other activities. Therefore, it is more plausible that the building under construction would cause noise disturbance in the adjacent office rather than crowding."}}
{"Q": "The family wanted to get to know their new neighbors. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The family invited the neighbors over for dinner. (B) The family waved to the neighbors from their yard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The family invited the neighbors over for dinner.\nExplanation: If the family wanted to get to know their new neighbors, the most plausible action would be to invite them over for a meal or some other social gathering. Waving from the yard is a friendly gesture, but it doesn't necessarily lead to a deeper connection or conversation. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "Water splashed up from the pool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The swimmer dove into the pool. (B) The swimmer floated in the pool.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The swimmer dove into the pool.\nExplanation: When a swimmer dives into a pool, they create a force that pushes the water out of the way, causing it to splash up. On the other hand, if a swimmer is just floating in the pool, they are not creating any force that would cause water to splash up. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I bit into a slice of watermelon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I accidentally swallowed a seed. (B) I accidentally chipped my tooth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I accidentally swallowed a seed.\nExplanation: It is more common to accidentally swallow a seed while eating watermelon than to chip a tooth. Watermelon seeds are small and can easily be swallowed without noticing, while chipping a tooth would require a significant amount of force and is less likely to happen while eating a soft fruit like watermelon."}}
{"Q": "The boy tripped. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His jacket was unzipped. (B) His shoelaces were untied.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His shoelaces were untied.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy tripped because his shoelaces were untied, as this is a common cause of tripping. On the other hand, an unzipped jacket is less likely to cause someone to trip."}}
{"Q": "The woman put earplugs in. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was distracted by noise. (B) She got her ears pierced.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was distracted by noise.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for someone to put earplugs in is to block out noise. It is unlikely that getting her ears pierced would cause her to put earplugs in. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "I refilled my water bottle. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I drank all the water in it. (B) I kept it in the fridge.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the person drank all the water in the bottle, which led to the need to refill it. Keeping the bottle in the fridge may have made the water colder, but it would not have caused the need for a refill."}}
{"Q": "The television show was censored. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It contained vulgar language. (B) It had a complicated plot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It contained vulgar language.\nExplanation: The use of vulgar language is a common reason for television shows to be censored. It may be deemed inappropriate for certain audiences, such as children or those who are easily offended. A complicated plot, on the other hand, is not typically a reason for censorship. In fact, complex storylines are often praised in television shows."}}
{"Q": "The ship wrecked. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The crew drowned. (B) The crew encountered pirates.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The crew drowned.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the crew drowned as a result of the shipwreck, as this is a common outcome of such disasters. Encountering pirates is a possibility, but it is less likely than drowning, especially if there is no mention of pirates in the context of the story."}}
{"Q": "The boy felt stumped by the riddle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He solved the riddle. (B) He requested a hint.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He requested a hint.\nExplanation: Since the boy felt stumped by the riddle, it is more likely that he would ask for a hint to help him solve it rather than solving it immediately. Requesting a hint is a common strategy when someone is struggling to solve a riddle or puzzle."}}
{"Q": "The phone rang. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The man hung up the phone. (B) The man picked up the phone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The man picked up the phone.\nExplanation: When the phone rings, it is a natural response to pick it up to answer the call. Hanging up the phone would not be a logical response to a ringing phone unless the man intentionally did not want to answer the call. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman was staring at me. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I hugged her. (B) I felt uncomfortable.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I felt uncomfortable.\nExplanation: When someone stares at us, it can make us feel uneasy or self-conscious. It is unlikely that the appropriate response would be to hug the person, so feeling uncomfortable is a more plausible outcome."}}
{"Q": "The group left the museum. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They took pictures of the exhibits. (B) They viewed all the exhibits.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They viewed all the exhibits.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the group left the museum because they had finished viewing all the exhibits rather than just taking pictures of them. If they had only taken pictures, they could have stayed longer to view the exhibits in person."}}
{"Q": "The man started an argument with me. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My friend introduced me to the man. (B) My friend stood up for me.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. My friend stood up for me.\nExplanation: If the man started an argument with the speaker, it is likely that the speaker would need someone to support or defend them. Therefore, it is more plausible that the friend would stand up for the speaker rather than introducing them to the man."}}
{"Q": "The tire on my bike was flat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I pumped air into the tire. (B) I switched gears on the bike.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I pumped air into the tire.\nExplanation: When a bike tire is flat, the most logical solution is to pump air into the tire to inflate it. Switching gears on the bike would not have any effect on the flat tire."}}
{"Q": "The girl looked pale. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her father read her a story. (B) Her father felt her forehead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Her father felt her forehead.\nExplanation: If the girl looked pale, it could be a sign of illness or fatigue. Therefore, it would be more plausible for her father to check her temperature by feeling her forehead to see if she has a fever or any other symptoms that may require medical attention. Reading her a story would not necessarily address the cause of her paleness."}}
{"Q": "The pen ran out of ink. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I used a pencil. (B) I signed my name.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I used a pencil.\nExplanation: Since the pen ran out of ink, it was no longer usable for writing. Therefore, the most plausible solution would be to use a pencil instead. Signing one's name with a pen that has run out of ink would not be possible, so option B is not a viable answer."}}
{"Q": "The man was denied for a loan. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was in debt. (B) He started a business.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was in debt.\nExplanation: Being in debt is a common reason for loan denial as it indicates that the person may not be able to repay the loan. Lenders usually check the credit score and credit history of the borrower before approving a loan, and if the borrower has a high debt-to-income ratio or a history of missed payments, the lender may consider them a risky borrower and deny the loan. Starting a business, on the other hand, may or may not affect the loan approval depending on the lender's policies and the borrower's financial situation."}}
{"Q": "The girl stayed home from school. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She had chicken pox. (B) She enjoyed learning math.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She had chicken pox.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because chicken pox is a contagious illness that requires the infected person to stay home from school to prevent spreading it to others. Enjoying learning math is not a valid reason to stay home from school."}}
{"Q": "The trash bag was full. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I took it to the dumpster. (B) I dumped it down the sink.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I took it to the dumpster.\nExplanation: It is common practice to dispose of full trash bags in a dumpster or garbage can. Dumping it down the sink would not be a logical or appropriate solution as it could cause clogs and other plumbing issues. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I vacuumed the carpet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My roommate spilled punch. (B) My dog shed hair.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) My dog shed hair.\nExplanation: Vacuuming the carpet is a common task to remove pet hair and dander. It is more plausible that the cause of vacuuming the carpet was due to the shedding of dog hair rather than a roommate spilling punch."}}
{"Q": "The man lost his temper. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He turned off his computer. (B) He threw a chair across the room.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He threw a chair across the room.\nExplanation: Losing one's temper often results in an outburst of anger and frustration. While turning off a computer may be a possible reaction, throwing a chair across the room is a more plausible and extreme response to losing one's temper."}}
{"Q": "The girl threw a twig into the campfire. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The twig burned. (B) The fire went out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The twig burned.\nExplanation: When a twig is thrown into a campfire, it is highly likely that it will catch fire and burn. The heat from the fire will cause the twig to ignite and turn into ash. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B, which suggests that the fire went out, is unlikely as throwing a twig into a campfire would not be enough to extinguish the fire."}}
{"Q": "The man got out of the shower. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hot water was gone. (B) He couldn't find a towel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The hot water was gone.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man got out of the shower because the hot water was gone, as this is a common reason for people to end their shower. On the other hand, not being able to find a towel would not necessarily cause someone to get out of the shower, as they could simply use their hands to wipe off excess water or look for a towel elsewhere."}}
{"Q": "The parents wanted their children to go to college. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They set aside a savings fund for tuition. (B) They encouraged their children to play outside.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They set aside a savings fund for tuition.\nExplanation: If the parents wanted their children to go to college, it is more likely that they would take steps to financially prepare for it, such as setting aside a savings fund for tuition. Encouraging their children to play outside would not necessarily be related to their desire for their children to attend college."}}
{"Q": "The man unlaced his shoes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The shoes loosened. (B) The shoes became worn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The shoes loosened.\nExplanation: When the man unlaced his shoes, the laces were no longer holding the shoes tightly to his feet. As a result, the shoes would have become looser and easier to remove. Option B, that the shoes became worn, is not a plausible answer as there is no indication that the act of unlacing the shoes would cause them to become worn."}}
{"Q": "The man ate half of the entree. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He refrigerated the leftovers. (B) He saved the recipe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He refrigerated the leftovers.\nExplanation: If the man ate half of the entree, it is likely that there were leftovers. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would refrigerate the leftovers rather than saving the recipe. Saving the recipe would not be a necessary action in this situation."}}
{"Q": "My ankle was swollen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I put ice on it. (B) I rubbed lotion on it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I put ice on it.\nExplanation: When an ankle is swollen, it is usually due to inflammation caused by an injury or strain. Applying ice to the affected area can help reduce swelling by constricting blood vessels and decreasing blood flow to the area. Rubbing lotion on the swollen ankle would not have any effect on reducing the swelling."}}
{"Q": "My office door was open. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I talked to my colleague at my desk. (B) I overheard the conversation in the hall.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I talked to my colleague at my desk.\nExplanation: If the office door was open, it is more likely that someone would come in and talk to the person inside rather than just overhearing a conversation in the hall. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person talked to their colleague at their desk."}}
{"Q": "I had to wait in line. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I took a seat. (B) I skimmed a magazine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I skimmed a magazine.\nExplanation: Since the statement mentions waiting in line, it is more plausible that the person would pass the time by reading a magazine rather than taking a seat. Taking a seat would imply that there were available seats nearby, which may not be the case in a busy line. Skimming a magazine, on the other hand, is a common way to pass the time while waiting in line."}}
{"Q": "The man swatted at the fly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fly buzzed away. (B) The fly stayed still.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The fly buzzed away.\nExplanation: When someone swats at a fly, it is a natural reaction for the fly to fly away to avoid being hit. Therefore, it is more plausible that the fly buzzed away as a result of the man swatting at it. Option B, where the fly stays still, is less likely as it goes against the fly's instinct to avoid danger."}}
{"Q": "The man wrote a will. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was dying. (B) He was a widower.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man was dying. Writing a will is a common practice for individuals who want to ensure that their assets and belongings are distributed according to their wishes after their death. While being a widower may also be a reason for writing a will, it is not as strong of a reason as being terminally ill or facing a life-threatening situation."}}
{"Q": "The runner sensed his competitor gaining on him. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He dropped out of the race. (B) He sped up his pace.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He sped up his pace.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the runner would try to maintain or increase his lead by speeding up his pace rather than dropping out of the race. The sense of competition often motivates athletes to push themselves harder and strive for victory."}}
{"Q": "I thought carefully about the problem. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I asked for advice. (B) I came up with a solution.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I came up with a solution.\nExplanation: When someone thinks carefully about a problem, it usually means that they are trying to find a solution. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person came up with a solution rather than asking for advice. However, it is possible that they could have done both."}}
{"Q": "The traveler walked on the shaky suspension bridge. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He felt terrified. (B) He felt ecstatic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He felt terrified.\nExplanation: Walking on a shaky suspension bridge can be a nerve-wracking experience for many people. The uncertainty of the bridge's stability and the height can cause fear and anxiety in the traveler. Therefore, it is more plausible that the traveler felt terrified rather than ecstatic."}}
{"Q": "The man anticipated the team's victory. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He met his friends to watch the game. (B) He made a bet with his friends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He met his friends to watch the game.\nExplanation: Anticipating the team's victory would likely make the man excited to watch the game with his friends, as he would want to celebrate the win with them. Making a bet with his friends is also a possibility, but it is less likely as the sentence only mentions his anticipation of the team's victory, not his desire to gamble. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy couldn't fall asleep. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He set his alarm clock. (B) He counted sheep.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He counted sheep.\nExplanation: Counting sheep is a common technique used to help people fall asleep. It involves visualizing a flock of sheep jumping over a fence one by one, which can be a calming and repetitive activity that helps to clear the mind and induce sleep. Setting an alarm clock would not necessarily help the boy fall asleep, as it only ensures that he wakes up at a certain time. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
