Coffee, on the other hand, can actually have the opposite effect and promote the growth of bacteria, leading to a shorter lifespan for the flowers."}}
{"Q": "how do you put eyelashes on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) glue them on with mascara. (B) put eyelash glue on the fake eyelashes and then let it get tacky. then, place it on top of your actual eyelashes and let it dry on.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) put eyelash glue on the fake eyelashes and then let it get tacky. then, place it on top of your actual eyelashes and let it dry on.\n\nExplanation: This is the correct way to apply false eyelashes. Using mascara to glue them on can be messy and ineffective. Applying eyelash glue directly onto the false lashes and letting it get tacky before placing them on your natural lashes ensures a secure hold and a more natural look. It's important to let the glue dry completely before applying any makeup or opening your eyes fully to avoid any accidental smudging or shifting of the lashes."}}
{"Q": "Find spices easily in the kitchen.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Arrange spices from hot to mild in the kitchen in order to find them by taste. (B) Arrange your spices alphabetically to make finding them easy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Arrange your spices alphabetically to make finding them easy.\nExplanation: Alphabetical arrangement is a more practical and efficient way to organize spices in the kitchen. It allows for quick and easy access to the desired spice without having to search through the entire collection. Additionally, it is a universal system that most people are familiar with, making it easier for others to find and use the spices as well.

Transfer mixture to two 8x8x2 inch baking pans. Freeze about 8 hours until firm.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it uses whipping cream instead of caramelized onions, which is a more common ingredient in ice cream recipes. It also includes sweetened condensed milk, which is a common ingredient in no-churn ice cream recipes. The addition of vanilla extract and chocolate chips adds flavor and texture to the ice cream. The freezing time of 8 hours is also a common time for ice cream to freeze and become firm."}}
{"Q": "To combine cake ingredients.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) In a large mixing bowl, combined three egg yolks and half of the white granulated sugar and whisk till it reaches a pale red berry mixture. (B) In a large mixing bowl, combined three egg yolks and half of the white granulated sugar and whisk till it reaches a pale lemony yellow mixture.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. In a large mixing bowl, combined three egg yolks and half of the white granulated sugar and whisk till it reaches a pale lemony yellow mixture.\nExplanation: When combining cake ingredients, it is important to follow the recipe instructions carefully. In this case, the recipe calls for combining three egg yolks and half of the white granulated sugar in a large mixing bowl. Whisking the mixture until it reaches a pale lemony yellow color is a common step in cake making, as it helps to incorporate air into the mixture and create a light, fluffy texture. A pale red berry mixture, as described in option A, is not a typical color for cake batter and may indicate that the ingredients have been overmixed or that there is an issue with the recipe. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}

{"Q": "To remove sharpie pen from a couch,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) soak the area in soy milk so that the region is colored by it. (B) soak the stained area in milk for an hour and then rub away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Soak the stained area in milk for an hour and then rub away.\n\nExplanation: Milk contains lactic acid, which can help break down the ink in the sharpie pen. Soaking the stained area in milk for an hour can help loosen the ink, making it easier to remove. After soaking, gently rub the area with a clean cloth or sponge to remove the ink. It may take a few attempts to completely remove the stain, but this method is more plausible than soaking the area in soy milk, which may not have the same ink-removing properties."}}
{"Q": "To remove folds and creases from a sewing pattern", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) set a clothing iron on low and carefully iron the pattern to remove folds and creases before pinning to your fabric. (B) set a clothing iron on high and carefully iron the pattern to remove folds and creases before pinning to your fabric.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Setting a clothing iron on low is a more plausible answer because high heat can damage the pattern paper and cause it to shrink or warp. Ironing on low heat with a pressing cloth or a piece of muslin on top of the pattern can help remove folds and creases without damaging the paper. It's important to be gentle and avoid stretching or distorting the pattern while ironing."}}
{"Q": "how to get perfectly done grilled meat", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) move closer to the coals the longer it has been on. when almost finished, move directly on top of the coals. (B) Take your meat and fish off the grill a few seconds before it's perfectly done because it cooks an extra 5–10 degrees when resting", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Take your meat and fish off the grill a few seconds before it's perfectly done because it cooks an extra 5–10 degrees when resting.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is a well-known fact that meat continues to cook even after it is removed from the heat source. This is due to residual heat and the redistribution of juices within the meat. By taking the meat off the grill a few seconds before it is perfectly done, you can ensure that it reaches the desired level of doneness while resting. This will result in a juicier and more flavorful piece of meat. Moving closer to the coals as the meat cooks (option A) can result in uneven cooking and potentially overcooking the meat."}}
{"Q": "how do you floss your teeth with a toothpick?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) use the pick to scrape out any food stuck in your teeth. (B) chew on the toothpick", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Use the pick to scrape out any food stuck in your teeth.\nExplanation: Toothpicks can be used to remove food particles stuck between teeth, but it is important to use them carefully to avoid injuring the gums. To floss with a toothpick, gently insert the pick between the teeth and scrape it along the sides of each tooth to remove any debris. It is important to use a new toothpick for each tooth to avoid transferring bacteria from one tooth to another. Chewing on a toothpick is not an effective way to floss and can actually damage the teeth and gums."}}
{"Q": "how to winterize windows", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) put weather stripping around them to stop air from escaping and air from coming in (B) put weather stripping around them to stop air from escaping and air from coming into the dishwasher", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Putting weather stripping around windows is a common method of winterizing them.

{"Q": "How can I get free gym memberships?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Check with your health insurance co., many times they'll reimburse your gym costs. (B) Check with your auto insurance co., many times they'll reimburse your gym costs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Check with your health insurance co., many times they'll reimburse your gym costs.\nExplanation: Many health insurance companies offer gym membership reimbursement programs as part of their wellness initiatives. These programs may require you to meet certain criteria, such as attending the gym a certain number of times per month, but they can be a great way to get a free or discounted gym membership. Checking with your health insurance company is a more plausible answer than checking with your auto insurance company, as auto insurance companies are not typically associated with gym memberships."}}
{"Q": "how do you use cream?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) spray it all over your skin. (B) get a small amount of it, and spread it all over your skin wherever you'd like to apply it until you can't see it anymore.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Cream is a type of skincare product that is meant to be applied topically to the skin. To use cream, you should first get a small amount of it and then spread it all over your skin wherever you'd like to apply it until you can't see it anymore. This will help to ensure that the cream is evenly distributed and absorbed into your skin, providing the maximum benefit. Spraying cream all over your skin (option A) is not a common or effective way to use it."}}

{"Q": "To simmer water, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place in a metal bowl in the microwave on low heat (B) Place in a metal bowl on the stove over low heat", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Place in a metal bowl on the stove over low heat.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because simmering water requires a consistent and controlled heat source, which can be achieved on a stove over low heat. Placing a metal bowl in a microwave on low heat may not provide the same level of control and could potentially cause the water to boil or overheat. Additionally, it is not recommended to use metal in a microwave as it can cause sparks and damage to the appliance."}}
{"Q": "how to add a deeper flavor to ground beef?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) mash up cooked white rice, and form a ball. wrap ground beef around it, and inject with olive oil. (B) baste meat with brown butter — it insulates the meat and gives it a nutty flavor", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Basting the ground beef with brown butter is a more plausible answer as it adds a nutty flavor to the meat and also helps to keep it moist. Adding a ball of cooked rice and injecting with olive oil may not necessarily add a deeper flavor to the ground beef."}}
{"Q": "To make the base for a 3D Mickey Mouse head.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Place bowls under the paper and draw over them. (B) Place spoons under the paper and draw over them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Place bowls under the paper and draw over them.\nExplanation: Bowls have a round shape that closely resembles the shape of Mickey Mouse's head. By placing bowls under the paper and tracing around them, you can create a base for the 3D head that is symmetrical and proportional. Spoons, on the other hand, are too small and narrow to provide a suitable base for the head."}}
{"Q": "When heating milk to make cheese", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Leave in place without disrupting to prevent the milk from burning (B) Stir the whole time to prevent the milk from burning", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Stir the whole time to prevent the milk from burning.\nExplanation: Leaving the milk in place without disrupting it can cause it to burn at the bottom of the pot, which can affect the taste and texture of the cheese. Stirring the milk constantly helps distribute the heat evenly and prevents it from sticking to the bottom of the pot, ensuring that the cheese is made properly."}}
{"Q": "To prevent cupcakes from sticking to a pan, you can", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Place paper liners in the pan so the cupcakes don't stick (B) Place plastic liners in the pan so the cupcakes don't stick", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Place paper liners in the pan so the cupcakes don't stick.\n\nExplanation: Paper liners are specifically designed to prevent baked goods from sticking to the pan. They are made from non-stick materials and are easy to remove from the cupcakes once they are baked. Plastic liners, on the other hand, are not commonly used for baking and may not be heat-resistant, which could cause them to melt or stick to the cupcakes. Therefore, using paper liners is a more plausible and safe option to prevent cupcakes from sticking to the pan."}}
{"Q": "How do I clean car upholstery", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scrub the dirty areas with car soap and it will come up (B) Scrub the dirty areas with dish soap and it will come up", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Scrub the dirty areas with car soap and it will come up.\nExplanation: Car soap is specifically designed for cleaning car upholstery and is gentle enough to not damage the fabric. Dish soap, on the other hand, can be too harsh and may strip the fabric of its color or texture. Additionally, car soap is formulated to remove dirt and grime that is commonly found on car upholstery, making it a more effective choice for cleaning."}}
{"Q": "To get air bubbles out of cakes.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) For perfectly smooth cakes and cheesecakes, throw your pan of batter onto your counter top a few times before baking. The force of the pan hitting the counter forces the air bubbles up to the surface, so they don’t get trapped in the batter. (B) For perfectly smooth cakes and cheesecakes, drop your pan of batter onto your counter top a few times before baking. The force of the pan hitting the counter forces the air bubbles up to the surface, so they don’t get trapped in the batter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Dropping a pan of batter onto the counter top could cause the batter to spill or create uneven layers. However, gently tapping the pan on the counter top a few times can help release any air bubbles that may be trapped in the batter. This method is less likely to cause damage to the batter and is a more plausible solution."}}
{"Q": "To prepare an empty 2 litter soda bottle to use as a plant pot.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Clean the soda bottle with water and cut it is half. And drill holes on the bottom of the bottle so the water can drain out. (B) Clean the soda bottle with water and cut it is half. And drill holes on the top of the bottle so the water can drain out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Clean the soda bottle with water and cut it in half. And drill holes on the bottom of the bottle so the water can drain out.\n\nExplanation: Cutting the bottle in half will create a container that is open at the top and bottom, allowing for proper drainage. Drilling holes on the bottom of the bottle will ensure that excess water can escape, preventing the roots from becoming waterlogged and potentially rotting. Holes on the top of the bottle would not allow for proper drainage and could lead to water accumulating in the container, which could harm the plant."}}

Option B mentions using jump rings, but does not provide any further instruction on how to use them to attach the pendant to the necklace."}}
{"Q": "How do I make the pattern for the baby leather shoes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Create a template on a piece of paper by placing your babies shoe on the paper and drawing around it. (B) Create a template on a piece of paper by placing your babies foot on the paper and drawing around it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Create a template on a piece of paper by placing your babies shoe on the paper and drawing around it.\n\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it takes into account the shape and size of the shoe, which is what you want to replicate. Drawing around the foot may not give an accurate representation of the shoe shape, and may not account for any extra space needed for the shoe to fit comfortably. By using the shoe as a template, you can ensure that the pattern will fit properly and look like the original shoe."}}

{"Q": "clothing", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can be laid on a wood plank for ironing (B) can be laid on a bed for ironing", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Clothing can be laid on a bed for ironing.\nExplanation: While clothing can technically be laid on a wood plank for ironing, it is not a common or practical method for most people. On the other hand, laying clothing on a bed for ironing is a more plausible answer as it is a common and convenient method for many people. It allows for a larger surface area to work with and is often more comfortable to do than standing at a traditional ironing board."}}
{"Q": "how do you smear liquid?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) pour it all over. (B) rub it all over.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Rub it all over.\nExplanation: Smearing liquid typically involves spreading it evenly over a surface.

Transfer fudge to Greased 8 x 13\" pan and let cool before cutting into squares.\n\nExplanation: This answer seems more plausible because it uses marshmallow creme instead of acetone, which is not a food ingredient. Additionally, marshmallow creme is a common ingredient in fudge recipes and would provide a creamy texture. The addition of lemon extract and yellow food coloring would give the fudge a lemon flavor and appearance. Swirling in lemon curd would add a tangy and sweet flavor to the fudge. Overall, this recipe seems more realistic and delicious."}}
{"Q": "how do you hydrate after working out?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) drink some whiskey with coke. (B) drink a bottle of cold water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Drink a bottle of cold water.\nExplanation: After working out, it is important to replenish the fluids lost through sweat. Drinking water is the best way to hydrate as it helps regulate body temperature, aids in digestion, and helps transport nutrients to the muscles. Cold water can also help cool down the body after a workout. Drinking alcohol like whiskey with coke can actually dehydrate the body and undo the benefits of the workout."}}
{"Q": "blankets", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can cover lights  (B) can cover candles ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Blankets can be used to cover candles to extinguish the flame and prevent any potential fire hazards.

{"Q": "To hold a bungee cord so it stays stretched out, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Loop one end of the bungee cord into a hook so it remains taught. (B) Loop both ends of the bungee cord into hooks so it remains taught.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Loop one end of the bungee cord into a hook so it remains taught.\nExplanation: By looping one end of the bungee cord into a hook, the other end can be attached to an anchor point, such as a tree or post, to keep the cord stretched out. If both ends were looped into hooks, there would be no anchor point to keep the cord taut. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How to peel an onion?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Using a small sharp knife, cut the top and the bottom off the onion. Remove half of the remaining skin from the    onion. (B) Using a small sharp knife, cut the top and the bottom off the onion. Remove the remaining skin from the    onion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Using a small sharp knife, cut the top and the bottom off the onion. Remove half of the remaining skin from the onion.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is the correct way to peel an onion. By cutting off the top and bottom of the onion, it makes it easier to remove the skin. Removing half of the remaining skin allows for a better grip on the onion while cutting it."}}
{"Q": "How can I get the best Bell pepper?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Look at the bottom part of the pepper, if it has 4 bumps it is a female and has more seeds but the flesh is sweeter and better for raw eating, the males have 3 bumps and are firmer and good for cooking. (B) Look at the bottom part of the plastic bag, if it has 4 bumps it is a female and has more seeds but the flesh is sweeter and better for raw eating, the males have 3 bumps and are firmer and good for cooking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Look at the bottom part of the pepper, if it has 4 bumps it is a female and has more seeds but the flesh is sweeter and better for raw eating, the males have 3 bumps and are firmer and good for cooking.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it provides a specific and accurate method for selecting the best bell pepper based on the characteristics of the pepper itself. Looking at the bottom part of the plastic bag is not a reliable indicator of the quality of the pepper inside. Additionally, the explanation for option A provides reasoning for why the female peppers are better for raw eating and the male peppers are better for cooking, which is helpful information for choosing the right pepper for a specific dish."}}
{"Q": "To make a hood for a cloak.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sew two pieces of fabric together. (B) Drape fabric over your head.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sew two pieces of fabric together.\nExplanation: To make a hood for a cloak, it is more plausible to sew two pieces of fabric together in the shape of a hood. This will ensure that the hood fits properly and stays in place. Drape fabric over your head may not provide the desired shape and structure for a functional hood. Sewing also allows for customization, such as adding a lining or adjusting the size of the hood."}}
{"Q": "To make the caffeine in coffee release slowly after consumption,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a non-fat coffee cream powder instead of cream or milk in your coffee, to dilute the portion of coffee in the beverage. (B) add butter to the coffee so that the caffeine combines into the butter and trickles into the body slower.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: Using a non-fat coffee cream powder instead of cream or milk in your coffee can dilute the portion of coffee in the beverage, which can slow down the release of caffeine into the body. This is because the caffeine molecules are dispersed in a larger volume of liquid, which can take longer to be absorbed by the body. Adding butter to the coffee, as suggested in option B, is not a plausible answer as there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that caffeine combines with butter and trickles into the body slower."}}
{"Q": "To obtain meximum deliciousness of the nutella cookies", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Serve with a glass of milk (B) Serve with a glass of water", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Serve with a glass of milk.\nExplanation: Nutella cookies are rich and sweet, and milk is a classic pairing that can help balance out the sweetness and provide a creamy contrast. Water, on the other hand, may not complement the flavors as well and could leave the mouth feeling dry. Therefore, serving with a glass of milk is a more plausible answer to obtain maximum deliciousness."}}

Hit the ball with the upper part of your palm. (B) Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, with most of your weight on the front foot. Toss the ball in front of your hitting arm.  Hit the ball with the lower part of your palm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: When hitting a volleyball, it is important to have a stable base, which is achieved by standing with your feet shoulder width apart and most of your weight on the back foot. Tossing the ball in front of your hitting arm allows you to make contact with the ball at the highest point possible, giving you more power and control. Hitting the ball with the upper part of your palm allows you to make a clean contact with the ball, increasing the chances of a successful hit. Hitting the ball with the lower part of your palm (as in option B) can result in an awkward and ineffective hit."}}
{"Q": "Remove pop bottle cap that is stuck on", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Run the pop bottle under hot water for 5 minutes to loosen the lid, remove from the sink, dry off with paper towel, grip the cap in your hand and twist (B) Run the pop bottle under cold water for 5 minutes to loosen the lid, remove from the sink, dry off with paper towel, place the cap in your hand and twist", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Running the pop bottle under hot water will cause the plastic to expand slightly, making it easier to twist off the cap. Cold water may cause the plastic to contract, making it more difficult to remove the cap. Drying off the bottle and gripping the cap with a paper towel will provide a better grip and prevent slipping."}}
{"Q": "How to keep cool outside.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Add some peppermint oil to a spray bottle of water, spray self often avoiding eyes. (B) Sit under a shade tree.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sit under a shade tree.\nExplanation: Sitting under a shade tree is a more plausible answer as it provides natural shade and helps to reduce the direct exposure to the sun's heat. Adding peppermint oil to a spray bottle of water may provide a cooling sensation, but it is not a long-term solution and may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with sensitive skin or allergies. Additionally, it may not be practical to carry a spray bottle of water and peppermint oil around when spending time outside."}}
{"Q": "How do you make gluten free brownies?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Instead of putting flour into the mixture, use almond meal to remove the wheat and give the brownie a nutty flavor.

Instead of putting flour into the mixture, use almond meal to remove the wheat and give the brownie a nutty flavor.\n\nExplanation: Almond meal is a common substitute for wheat flour in gluten-free baking. It is made from ground almonds and provides a nutty flavor and moist texture to baked goods. Apple sauce is not a suitable substitute for flour as it is a liquid and would not provide the necessary structure to the brownie. Additionally, it would give the brownie a fruity flavor which may not be desirable."}}
{"Q": "Make a yoga mat carrier.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wrap one end with bungee cord. (B) Wrap center with bungee cord.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Wrap center with bungee cord.\nExplanation: Wrapping the center of the yoga mat with bungee cord will create a secure and adjustable carrier. The bungee cord can be easily stretched to fit different sizes of yoga mats and can be tightened to keep the mat in place during transportation. This method also allows for easy carrying over the shoulder or across the body. Wrapping one end with bungee cord may not provide enough support and could cause the mat to slip out of the carrier."}}

On the back of the sewing machine near the foot there is a lever. Rotate the lever clockwise to lower the foot.\n\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because most sewing machines have a lever located at the back of the machine near the foot that is used to lower the foot. Rotating the lever clockwise will lower the foot, while rotating it counterclockwise will raise the foot. Pushing the lever down is not a common method for lowering the foot on a sewing machine."}}
{"Q": "Melt mini marshmallows.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place mini marshmallows in a microwave safe bowl and place in microwave; cook in 60 second intervals, stirring each time, until they are melted. (B) Place mini marshmallows in a microwave safe bowl and place in microwave; cook in 30 second intervals, stirring each time, until they are melted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Place mini marshmallows in a microwave safe bowl and place in microwave; cook in 60 second intervals, stirring each time, until they are melted.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because melting mini marshmallows in the microwave requires careful attention to prevent them from burning. Cooking in 60 second intervals and stirring each time allows for even melting and prevents overheating. Cooking in 30 second intervals may not be enough time for the marshmallows to fully melt and could result in uneven melting or burning."}}

(B) Keep a shoe basket near the entrance to collect those dirty shoes and keep your tent floor spic and span.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Keep a shoe box near the entrance to collect those dirty shoes and keep your tent floor spic and span.\nExplanation: A shoe box is a more practical and space-saving option compared to a basket, especially when camping in a small tent. It can also be easily closed to prevent any dirt or bugs from getting inside the box. Additionally, a shoe box can be reused for other purposes, such as storing small items or as a makeshift table."}}
{"Q": "napkin", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) protect ice cream scoop from damage (B) hold ice cream scoop to keep hands warm", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a napkin would be used to hold an ice cream scoop to keep hands warm, rather than to protect the scoop from damage. Napkins are typically made of thin, soft material and would not provide much protection against damage to a metal or plastic scoop. However, using a napkin to hold the scoop would prevent the cold metal from making direct contact with the hands, which could be uncomfortable or even painful."}}

Flour, on the other hand, can be white or off-white, but it is not a common color for toilet tissue. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Shave using an organic shaving cream", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use salt instead of shaving cream on your next shave. It is harsh on your skin and provides no moisture at all. (B) Use olive oil instead of shaving cream on your next shave. It is smooth on your skin and provides a lot of moisture.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Use olive oil instead of shaving cream on your next shave. It is smooth on your skin and provides a lot of moisture.\n\nExplanation: Olive oil is a natural and organic alternative to shaving cream. It is rich in antioxidants and fatty acids that help to moisturize and protect the skin. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that can help to soothe any irritation caused by shaving. On the other hand, using salt instead of shaving cream is not a good idea as it can be harsh on the skin and cause dryness and irritation. Therefore, using olive oil as a shaving cream alternative is a more plausible and beneficial option."}}
{"Q": "How can I soothe my tongue if I burn it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put some salt on it. (B) Put some sugar on it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Put some sugar on it.\nExplanation: Sugar can help to soothe a burnt tongue because it has a cooling effect and can help to reduce inflammation. Salt, on the other hand, can actually make the burning sensation worse and may even cause further irritation. It's important to let the sugar dissolve slowly in your mouth rather than swallowing it right away. Drinking cool water or sucking on ice chips can also help to alleviate the discomfort."}}

To make Apple Roses, soak apple slices in lemon water and place the entire bowl into the microwave for about 3 minutes and drain off all the liquid. This will make the slices more pliable.\n\nExplanation: Heating the apple slices in the microwave for a short period of time will make them more pliable and easier to shape into roses. If the slices are too stiff and rigid, they will break when trying to roll them into a rose shape. Soaking the slices in lemon water will prevent them from browning and add a slight tangy flavor. Draining off the liquid will prevent the apple slices from becoming too wet and difficult to work with."}}
{"Q": "How to chill dough for ricotta tart.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Roll dough into a ball and wrap in saran wrap then place in the freezer for 20 minutes. (B) Roll dough into a ball and wrap in saran wrap then place in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Roll dough into a ball and wrap in saran wrap then place in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.\n\nExplanation: Chilling the dough helps to prevent it from becoming too soft and sticky, making it easier to handle and shape. Freezing the dough for only 20 minutes may cause it to become too hard and difficult to work with. Therefore, placing the dough in the refrigerator for 20 minutes is a more plausible answer as it will allow the dough to chill and firm up without becoming too hard."}}
{"Q": "To make steak tender.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Add baking soda  to the top of the meat and let it rest for five minutes. Remove the baking powder after five minutes. (B) Marinate the meat with acidic ingredients to break down tough proteins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Marinate the meat with acidic ingredients to break down tough proteins.\n\nExplanation: Marinating meat with acidic ingredients like vinegar, lemon juice, or wine can help break down the tough proteins in the meat, making it more tender. The acid in the marinade helps to denature the proteins, which makes them more tender and easier to chew. Adding baking soda to the meat can also help to tenderize it, but it needs to be used carefully as too much can make the meat taste soapy. Additionally, leaving baking soda on the meat for too long can cause it to become mushy. Therefore, marinating with acidic ingredients is a more plausible and reliable method for tenderizing steak."}}

Singing to a group of people would not be considered a serenade in the traditional sense."}}
{"Q": "How can I make a funnel?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cut an empty plastic soda bottle in half and use the top. (B) Cut an empty plastic soda bottle in half and use the bottom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cut an empty plastic soda bottle in half and use the top.\nExplanation: Using the top half of the bottle will create a funnel shape that is wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, which is ideal for pouring liquids or other materials into a smaller container or opening. The bottom half of the bottle would not create a funnel shape and would not be as effective for this purpose.

Make Bulgur with Raisins, adding 1/2 chopped fennel bulb with the onion; replace the pine nuts with cashews and the raisins with chopped dried figs.\n\nExplanation: This option provides a clear and simple substitution for the raisins with chopped dried figs, while also adding a new flavor element with the addition of fennel. The substitution of pine nuts with cashews is also a reasonable choice, as both nuts have a similar texture and can be used interchangeably in many recipes. The mention of cast iron pans in option B is irrelevant and confusing, as the type of pan used does not affect the recipe."}}
{"Q": "What knife is best to cut a watermelon?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) You would need to use a very large knife that is meant for food prep. (B) You would need to use a very large butcher knife that is meant for cooking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. You would need to use a very large knife that is meant for food prep.\nExplanation: A large knife that is meant for food prep, such as a chef's knife or a Santoku knife, would be the best option for cutting a watermelon. These knives have a sharp, wide blade that can easily slice through the tough rind and soft flesh of the watermelon. A butcher knife, on the other hand, is designed for cutting through meat and may not be as effective for cutting through a watermelon."}}

{"Q": "How can I sweat less?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use laser eye surgery because according to dermatologist Mary Lupo, MD, although its purpose is getting rid of hair, it works great for getting rid of excessive sweat in the underarm area, too: “I find that it leads to less sweat production and decreases odor too, because your hair accumulates more bacteria than your skin.” (B) Use laser hair removal because according to dermatologist Mary Lupo, MD, although its purpose is getting rid of hair, it works great for getting rid of excessive sweat in the underarm area, too: “I find that it leads to less sweat production and decreases odor too, because your hair accumulates more bacteria than your skin.”", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Use laser hair removal.\nExplanation: Laser hair removal can help reduce excessive sweating in the underarm area because it targets the hair follicles, which can accumulate bacteria and contribute to odor. By removing the hair, there is less surface area for bacteria to grow, leading to decreased odor and sweat production. However, it is important to note that laser hair removal is not a permanent solution and may require multiple sessions for optimal results. Additionally, it may not be effective for excessive sweating in other areas of the body. Other options for reducing excessive sweating include antiperspirants, prescription medications, and lifestyle changes such as wearing breathable clothing and avoiding spicy foods."}}

(B) Place a square of screen over a bowl and pour gravy through to strain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Place a square of screen over a bowl and pour gravy through to strain.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it involves using a strainer to separate the lumps from the gravy. By placing a square of screen over a bowl and pouring the gravy through it, the screen will catch any lumps and allow the smooth gravy to pass through. This method is commonly used in cooking to remove any unwanted solids from liquids. Placing a square of screen beside a bowl and pouring gravy into the bowl is not a practical solution as it does not involve any straining or separation of lumps."}}

{"Q": "bath tub", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can hold a car easily. (B) can hold a bowling ball easily.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible for a bathtub to hold a bowling ball easily than a car. A bathtub is typically designed to hold a person comfortably, and while some larger tubs may be able to accommodate two people, it is unlikely that they would be able to hold a car. On the other hand, a bowling ball is small enough to fit comfortably in most bathtubs, and the weight of the ball would not be a problem for the tub's structure."}}
{"Q": "To open a milk container.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Twist off the top and remove the seal underneath. (B) Twist off the top, discard it, and remove the seal underneath.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Twist off the top and remove the seal underneath.\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer because most milk containers have a twist-off cap that is designed to be removed to access the milk. Underneath the cap, there is usually a seal that needs to be removed before the milk can be poured. Discarding the cap (option B) is not necessary and could lead to spills or difficulty resealing the container."}}
{"Q": "Prepare clay for a kiln", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Allow clay to dry completely then take a damp smooth sponge and smooth away imperfections (B) Soak clay in water then take a damp smooth sponge and smooth away imperfections", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Allow clay to dry completely then take a damp smooth sponge and smooth away imperfections.\n\nExplanation: Allowing the clay to dry completely before firing it in the kiln is important to prevent cracking and warping during the firing process. Soaking the clay in water before firing can cause the clay to expand and crack in the kiln. Once the clay is completely dry, using a damp smooth sponge to smooth away imperfections will help to create a smooth surface for the glaze to adhere to and prevent any rough spots from causing the glaze to run or pool during firing."}}
{"Q": "cut an onion without crying", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cut off the root of the onion before you slice. (B) cut off the root of the onion before you crush with bare hands", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cut off the root of the onion before you slice.\nExplanation: The root of the onion contains a high concentration of sulfur compounds that are released when the onion is cut, causing tears. By cutting off the root before slicing, you reduce the amount of sulfur compounds released and therefore reduce the likelihood of tears. Crushing the onion with bare hands, as suggested in option B, is not a recommended method as it can cause skin irritation and increase the release of sulfur compounds."}}
{"Q": "To cut a precise chunk out of a wood plank, you can", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use a jigsaw (B) Use a chainsaw", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Use a jigsaw.\nExplanation: A jigsaw is a handheld power tool that allows for precise cuts in wood. It has a small, thin blade that can be easily maneuvered to cut out specific shapes or chunks from a plank. A chainsaw, on the other hand, is a larger and more powerful tool that is better suited for cutting through thicker branches or logs, and is not as precise as a jigsaw.

Change the sewing machine needle to a denim/leather needle. Lay the inner tube fabric on top of each other and run through the sewing machine at the desired edge to be sewn.\n\nExplanation: A denim/leather needle is stronger and thicker than a regular needle, making it suitable for sewing through the thick and tough material of a bike inner tube. The inner tube fabric should be laid on top of each other to ensure a strong and secure seam. Running it through the sewing machine at the desired edge to be sewn will create a straight and even seam. A lace needle is not suitable for sewing through thick and tough materials like a bike inner tube."}}
{"Q": "How do you blend out your eye shadow?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place the bristles of a blending brush lightly on your eyelid at the edge of the eye shadow, then make tight circles with the brush not touching the skin. (B) Place the bristles of a blending brush lightly on your eyelid at the edge of the eye shadow, then make tight circles with the brush against the skin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: When blending out eye shadow, it is important to use a light hand and not apply too much pressure against the skin. Option A suggests placing the bristles of a blending brush lightly on the eyelid at the edge of the eye shadow and making tight circles without touching the skin. This technique allows for a gradual blending of the eye shadow without smudging or removing it. Option B, on the other hand, suggests making tight circles with the brush against the skin, which can cause the eye shadow to become patchy or blend too harshly. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer for blending out eye shadow."}}

{"Q": "How to prevent a poached egg from losing its shape?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When cracking the egg into the water, stir the water to create a whirlpool effect (B) After removing the egg from the water, stir the water to create a whirlpool effect", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. When cracking the egg into the water, stir the water to create a whirlpool effect.\n\nExplanation: When you crack an egg into simmering water, the egg white tends to spread out in the water, which can cause the egg to lose its shape. By stirring the water to create a whirlpool effect, the egg white will wrap around the yolk and help the egg maintain its shape. This technique is commonly used by chefs to create perfectly shaped poached eggs. After the egg is cooked, it can be removed from the water using a slotted spoon. Stirring the water after removing the egg will not have any effect on the shape of the egg."}}

Add flour and salt into bowl and mix until all the ingredients become a hard dough. Cut dough in half and color one half with red food coloring and the other with green food coloring (B) In a large bowl cream butter and sugar until creamy, add extract and egg to the bowl and mix together. Add flour and salt into bowl and mix until all the ingredients become a soft dough. Cut dough in half and color one half with red food coloring and the other with green food coloring", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. In a large bowl cream butter and sugar until creamy, add extract and egg to the bowl and mix together. Add flour and salt into bowl and mix until all the ingredients become a hard dough. Cut dough in half and color one half with red food coloring and the other with green food coloring.\n\nExplanation: Peppermint candy is a hard candy, so it makes sense that the dough should be hard as well. Creaming the butter and sugar together until creamy is a common step in making dough, and adding the extract and egg will give the dough its peppermint flavor and help bind it together. Mixing in the flour and salt until the dough becomes hard will ensure that the candy will be firm and hold its shape. Finally, cutting the dough in half and coloring each half with red and green food coloring will give the candy its festive appearance."}}
{"Q": "How should I drill the hole in the back of the frame?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Carefully poke a hole through the back by using a Phillips head screwdriver and striking the end with a hammer.

You can eyeball the location since it doesn't have to be exact.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Using a portable drill with a small bit is a more precise and controlled method of drilling a hole in the back of a frame. It allows for a cleaner hole and reduces the risk of damaging the frame. Eyeballing the location is acceptable since the hole doesn't have to be exact, but it's still important to be as accurate as possible to ensure the hole is in the desired location. Using a screwdriver and hammer can be unpredictable and may cause the frame to crack or splinter."}}
{"Q": "hands", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can get a tan palms up (B) can get sweaty palms up", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Hands can get a tan when palms are facing up because the skin on the back of the hands is exposed to the sun's rays. However, hands are less likely to get sweaty when palms are facing up because sweat glands are located on the palms and fingers, and gravity pulls sweat down towards the ground."}}
{"Q": "How can I make glow sticks last longer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Refrigerate or place the glow sticks in the freezer to stop the glow sticks from glowing. Reheat the glow sticks carefully to make them glow again. (B) Store the glow sticks when not in use in a cool area.

If possible, make sure the area is humid and moist, and away from direct light such as the sun.\nExplanation: Glow sticks work by a chemical reaction between two substances that produce light. Storing them in a cool and dry place slows down the chemical reaction, which can make them last longer. However, storing them in a humid and moist area can also help because the moisture can slow down the reaction as well. Direct light, such as sunlight, can also speed up the reaction, so it's best to keep them away from it. Refrigerating or freezing the glow sticks can actually damage them and make them less effective."}}
{"Q": "To prevent egg shells in your cookie dough,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) crack the eggs open over another smaller container first and check for egg shells before adding them to the rest of the dough (B) crack the eggs open over the container with the dough and check for egg shells before adding them to the rest of the dough", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Cracking the eggs open over another smaller container first and checking for egg shells before adding them to the rest of the dough is a more plausible answer because it allows you to catch any egg shells before they mix in with the dough. If you crack the eggs open directly over the container with the dough, it can be difficult to spot any egg shells and they may end up in the dough."}}

(B) turn on the stove light.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) turn on the stove light.\nExplanation: Turning on the stove light is a more plausible answer as most stoves come with a built-in light that illuminates the inside of the oven, making it easy to check on food without opening the door. Shining a flashlight inside may not be as effective as the light may not reach all areas of the oven, and it may also be difficult to hold the flashlight steady while trying to look inside."}}
{"Q": "How to sharpen a pencil without a pencil sharpener?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Take the handle of a scissor and scrape away at the wood at the bottom to reveal more pencil (B) Take the edge of a scissor and scrape away at the wood at the tip to reveal more pencil", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Take the handle of a scissor and scrape away at the wood at the bottom to reveal more pencil.\nExplanation: This method is more plausible because it involves scraping away at the wood at the bottom of the pencil, which is where the lead is located. By doing so, more lead is exposed, allowing for a sharper point. Scarping away at the wood at the tip may result in breaking the lead or damaging the pencil. However, it is important to note that this method may not produce the same level of sharpness as a pencil sharpener."}}
{"Q": "How to clean a hairbrush.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Squirt shampoo onto the brush. Add water and lather. Rinse with cool water. Use a comb to remove any hair stuck in the brush. (B) Squirt conditioner onto the brush. Add water and lather. Rinse with cool water. Use a comb to remove any hair stuck in the brush.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Shampoo is designed to remove dirt, oil, and buildup from hair, so it makes sense to use it to clean a hairbrush. Adding water and lathering will help to loosen any debris stuck in the bristles, and rinsing with cool water will help to remove any remaining shampoo. Using a comb to remove any hair stuck in the brush is also a good idea to ensure that the brush is completely clean. Conditioner, on the other hand, is designed to moisturize and soften hair, so it is not as effective for cleaning a hairbrush."}}

{"Q": "Avoid wasting power in fridge.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Keep fridge 3/4 full. (B) Keep fridge 1/4 full.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Keep fridge 3/4 full.\nExplanation: Keeping the fridge 3/4 full is a more plausible answer as it helps to maintain a consistent temperature inside the fridge. When the fridge is empty, it takes more energy to cool the empty space, and when it's too full, the air circulation is restricted, making it harder for the fridge to maintain a consistent temperature. Keeping the fridge 3/4 full allows for proper air circulation and reduces the amount of energy needed to cool the fridge. Additionally, having a well-stocked fridge means that the door is opened less frequently, which also helps to save energy."}}

{"Q": "To iron small spaces in between buttons on a shirt.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use a hair flat iron to get those small spaces between buttons. (B) Use a soldering iron to get those small spaces between buttons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Use a hair flat iron to get those small spaces between buttons.\nExplanation: Using a hair flat iron is a more plausible answer as it is designed to be used on fabrics and has a smaller surface area that can easily fit in between buttons. A soldering iron, on the other hand, is not designed for use on fabrics and can easily damage the shirt. It also has a larger surface area that can easily burn or melt the fabric."}}
{"Q": "To create the perfect white russian.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put a white russian mix and ice in a blender and blend on high for 3 minutes until smooth. (B) Put white russian ingredients together in a shaker and shake it up and pour over ice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Put white russian ingredients together in a shaker and shake it up and pour over ice.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because a white russian typically consists of vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream. Mixing these ingredients in a shaker will ensure that they are well combined and chilled. Pouring the mixture over ice will also help to keep the drink cold and refreshing. Blending the mix and ice in a blender for 3 minutes may result in a watery and over-blended drink, which is not ideal for a white russian."}}
{"Q": "To clean stainless steel pots,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) spray the pot with apple cider vinegar and rub with a clean cloth in the direction of the east. (B) spray the pot with apple cider vinegar and rub with a clean cloth in the direction of the grain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Spraying the pot with apple cider vinegar and rubbing with a clean cloth in the direction of the grain is a more plausible answer because it is a common method for cleaning stainless steel pots.

(B) stay there without permission", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neither A nor B are appropriate options. \nExplanation: Squatting, or occupying a property without permission, is illegal and can result in legal consequences. It is important to respect the property rights of others and find alternative solutions for exercising or performing activities that require squatting in an apartment, such as using a gym or finding a public park."}}
{"Q": "how do you cheese something?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sprinkle cheese all over it. (B) sprinkle cheese underneath it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) sprinkle cheese all over it.\nExplanation: To \"cheese\" something means to add cheese to it in a way that enhances its flavor or texture. Sprinkling cheese all over something, such as a pizza or pasta dish, is a common way to cheese it. This allows the cheese to melt and blend with the other ingredients, creating a delicious and cheesy dish. Sprinkling cheese underneath something, on the other hand, may not allow the cheese to melt properly and may not provide the desired cheesy flavor."}}
{"Q": "Prevent cake from sticking to pan.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Set pan on a dry towel after taking out of oven. (B) Set pan on a damp towel after taking out of oven.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.

Sandpaper can be used to create a rough surface, which will help the glue stick better. If the area is left smooth and clean, the glue may not bond as well and the patch may not hold. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How do you dry herbs when making homemade herb oil?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place freshly washed and clean herbs in a cold refrigerator. (B) Place freshly washed and clean herbs in a food dehydrator.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Place freshly washed and clean herbs in a food dehydrator.\nExplanation: Drying herbs is an important step when making homemade herb oil as it helps to remove any excess moisture that can cause the oil to spoil. While placing herbs in a cold refrigerator can help to preserve their freshness, it does not effectively dry them. On the other hand, a food dehydrator is designed specifically for drying herbs and can do so quickly and efficiently without damaging their flavor or aroma. Therefore, it is a more plausible answer for drying herbs when making homemade herb oil."}}
{"Q": "How do I get the weeds to stop coming back in my garden?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use some weed killer on your garden. (B) Use some fertilizer on your garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Use some weed killer on your garden.\nExplanation: Weed killer is specifically designed to kill weeds and prevent them from growing back. Fertilizer, on the other hand, is used to provide nutrients to plants to help them grow, but it will not prevent weeds from growing.

Squeeze the bottle until ketchup comes out.\nExplanation: Ketchup bottles are designed with a narrow opening and a squeezeable body to allow for easy dispensing of the condiment. By squeezing the bottle, the pressure inside forces the ketchup out of the opening. Taking off the bottle top and pouring the ketchup out may result in a mess and uneven distribution of the condiment."}}
{"Q": "To use an Nintendo 64 rumble pak.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Insert the pak into the controller. (B) Insert the pak into the console.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: The Nintendo 64 rumble pak is designed to be inserted into the controller, not the console. This is because the rumble feature is meant to enhance the player's experience by providing physical feedback through the controller. Therefore, it makes more sense for the rumble pak to be inserted into the controller, which is the device that the player is holding and interacting with during gameplay."}}
{"Q": "To increase the heat in a recipe using jalapenos, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Remove the seeds (B) Leave the seeds in", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Remove the seeds.\nExplanation: The seeds and membranes of jalapenos contain most of the capsaicin, which is the compound responsible for the heat in peppers. Removing the seeds will decrease the heat level in the recipe. Leaving the seeds in will increase the heat level. Therefore, removing the seeds is a more plausible answer to increase the heat in a recipe using jalapenos."}}
{"Q": "Put wheels on the helicopter", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Attach straws to the top of the helicopter and put the wheels on the ends of the straws. (B) Attach straws to the bottom of the helicopter and put the wheels on the ends of the straws.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Attach straws to the bottom of the helicopter and put the wheels on the ends of the straws.\n\nExplanation: Attaching straws to the top of the helicopter would not provide enough stability for the wheels, as the weight of the helicopter would be on top of the straws. Attaching straws to the bottom of the helicopter would provide a more stable base for the wheels, as the weight of the helicopter would be distributed evenly on the straws. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How to grow a beard", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rinse your growing beard and apply beard oil daily. Wash with a beard wash 1-3 times a week. Grow your beard for at least a month before trimming (B) Rinse your growing beard and apply hair removal ointment. Wash with a beard wash 1-3 times a week. Grow your beard for at least a month before trimming", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rinse your growing beard and apply beard oil daily. Wash with a beard wash 1-3 times a week. Grow your beard for at least a month before trimming.\n\nExplanation: Beard oil helps to moisturize and condition the beard, making it less itchy and more manageable. Washing with a beard wash helps to keep the beard clean without stripping it of its natural oils. Growing the beard for at least a month before trimming allows it to fill in and reach a fuller appearance. Using hair removal ointment is not recommended as it can irritate the skin and damage the hair follicles, leading to patchy growth."}}
{"Q": "Spend a night in a parking lot without getting kicked out.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Park at a CVS. (B) Park at a Walmart.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Park at a Walmart.\nExplanation: Walmart is known for allowing overnight parking in their parking lots for RVs and travelers. They have a policy that allows it as long as the store manager approves and the vehicle is parked in a designated area away from the store entrance. CVS, on the other hand, does not have a policy for overnight parking and it is unlikely that they would allow it. Therefore, parking at a Walmart is a more plausible option for spending a night in a parking lot without getting kicked out."}}
{"Q": "How do I know if a bell pepper is full of seeds?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) flip it over and look at the bumps, the ones with four are female, and have more seeds. (B) Ask a worker at the grocery store if they can do a price check, if the barcode scans twice, its seedy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Flip it over and look at the bumps, the ones with four are female, and have more seeds.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the number of bumps on a bell pepper indicates its gender, with female peppers having four bumps and male peppers having three bumps. Female peppers tend to have more seeds than male peppers, so by looking at the bumps, you can get an idea of how seedy the pepper might be. Asking a worker at the grocery store to do a price check and scanning the barcode twice has nothing to do with the seediness of a bell pepper."}}
{"Q": "To brighten the flavor of a fish taco,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) add extra gravy and bread crumbs to the fried fish. (B) use lime and vegetables and cheese as topping.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Adding extra gravy and bread crumbs to the fried fish may make it heavier and mask the flavor of the fish. Using lime and vegetables and cheese as toppings can add freshness and tanginess to the taco, enhancing the flavor of the fish. This is a more plausible option to brighten the flavor of a fish taco."}}

Place the next 2 concrete planks on top, and place the 1st plank on top of the last one. Voila, a sturdy easy book shelf.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: This option seems more plausible as it uses the concrete bricks as a base for the planks, providing stability and support for the weight of the books. Option B, on the other hand, places the bricks on the planks themselves, which may not be as sturdy and could potentially cause the planks to warp or break under the weight of the books. Additionally, option A places the planks lengthwise, which is a more common orientation for bookshelves."}}
{"Q": "How can you make your stale bagel edible?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Run it under hot water for thirty seconds, then place in 350 degree oven for 5 min. (B) Run it under hot water for thirty seconds, then place in  microwave oven for 5 min.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Run it under hot water for thirty seconds, then place in 350 degree oven for 5 min.\nExplanation: Running the stale bagel under hot water will help to moisten it, and then placing it in a hot oven will help to crisp it up and give it a fresh texture.

{"Q": "Paint your nails with polish.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Wash your hands and make sure your nails are clean. Pat dry. Get a file and clean up the edges. Wipe with towel and polish carefully. (B) Wash your hands and make sure your nails are clean. Pat dry. Decide what color you would like them and start painting. Don't worry about getting color on the edges, Let dry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it includes important steps such as cleaning the nails, filing the edges, and being careful while polishing. It ensures that the nails are properly prepped before applying the polish, which can lead to a longer-lasting and neater manicure. Option B skips important steps and may result in a messy and uneven application."}}

Once the chicken is roasted, slice away the thigh with the drumstick in tact on both sides and then remove the breast and wing on both sides.\n\nExplanation: This method allows for equal portions of both white and dark meat to be served to each person. By leaving the drumstick attached to the thigh, it also makes for a more visually appealing presentation. Additionally, removing both breasts and wings ensures that everyone has access to the most desirable parts of the chicken."}}
{"Q": "How to properly store kitchen knives?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Once the knife is clean and dry, place it inside a sheath and into a draw or a alternatively without a sheath in a knifeblock (B) Once the knife is clean and dry, place it inside a sheath and into a knifeblock or alternatively without a sheath into drawer", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Once the knife is clean and dry, place it inside a sheath and into a drawer or alternatively without a sheath in a knife block.\n\nExplanation: Storing knives in a sheath helps protect the blade from damage and prevents accidental cuts. Placing the sheathed knife in a drawer keeps it out of sight and away from children's reach. Alternatively, a knife block can be used to store knives without a sheath, but it should be made of a material that won't dull the blade, such as wood or bamboo. It's important to keep knives clean and dry before storing them to prevent rust and corrosion."}}
{"Q": "To make as simple bread recipe,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) mix egg, yeast and water. (B) mix flour, yeast and water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Mixing flour, yeast, and water is a more plausible answer for a simple bread recipe as it includes the main ingredients needed for bread. The flour provides the structure and texture, the yeast helps the bread rise, and the water activates the yeast and binds the ingredients together. Adding an egg may be optional for flavor or richness, but it is not necessary for a basic bread recipe."}}

(B) go to credit karma.com. type in all your information and create an account. then you can check your score whenever you want.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Going to credit karma.com and creating an account is a more plausible answer as it is a free and easy way to check your credit score. It also provides additional information such as credit report and credit monitoring services. Calling a credit card company may not necessarily give you your credit score and may require additional steps or fees."}}
{"Q": "tape", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can keep a window closed (B) can keep a box closed", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Tape is commonly used to keep a box closed during shipping or storage. While it may be possible to use tape to keep a window closed temporarily, it is not a secure or long-term solution. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "listen", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can hear record the sound of a birds wings ride by (B) can hear a bird  ride by", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that one can hear the sound of a bird's wings flapping as it flies by, rather than just hearing the bird itself riding by. The sound of the wings flapping would be more distinct and noticeable than just the bird's presence."}}
{"Q": "How can I soak up spills on concrete?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use gravel kitty litter on spills. (B) Use dry cat food on spills.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Use gravel kitty litter on spills.\nExplanation: Gravel kitty litter is made of absorbent clay that can quickly soak up spills on concrete. It is a common and effective method used by many homeowners and businesses to clean up spills. Dry cat food, on the other hand, is not designed for spill cleanup and may not be as effective in absorbing liquids."}}

(B) Dab it with a rag and a some hot water. Then, apply stain remover and launder the clothes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Dab it with a rag and some cold water. Then, apply stain remover and launder the clothes.\nExplanation: Hot water can actually set the stain, making it more difficult to remove. Cold water is a safer option as it won't cause the stain to set. Dabbing the stain with a rag will help to remove any excess material before applying the stain remover. After applying the stain remover, launder the clothes according to the care instructions on the label."}}
{"Q": "how do you scavenge for something?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) you look for it in one place (B) you look everwhere for it", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) you look everywhere for it.\nExplanation: Scavenging involves searching for something that is not readily available or easily accessible. Therefore, it is more plausible to look everywhere for it rather than limiting the search to one place. Scavenging often involves exploring different areas and being resourceful in finding what you need."}}
{"Q": "To see what a baby looks like before it is born,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) take the pregnant woman to a doctor with an ultrasound to see how the baby looks. (B) make a small incision on the pregnant woman and then pull the baby out before putting it back.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Take the pregnant woman to a doctor with an ultrasound to see how the baby looks.\nExplanation: This is a safe and common method for expecting parents to see their baby before birth. An ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the developing fetus in the womb. It is a non-invasive procedure that poses no harm to the mother or the baby. On the other hand, option B is not only dangerous but also illegal and unethical. It can cause harm to both the mother and the baby and can lead to serious legal consequences. Therefore, option A is the only plausible and safe answer."}}
{"Q": "What ingredients do I need to make raspberry bark>", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) To make raspberry bark, you will need white bark and raspberries (B) To make raspberry bark, you will need white chocolate and raspberries", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. To make raspberry bark, you will need white chocolate and raspberries.\nExplanation: Raspberry bark is typically made with white chocolate as the base, which is melted and mixed with fresh raspberries. White bark is not a common ingredient in making raspberry bark. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Hardened ceilings", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can keep out swift and quick aerial drones from distant lands (B) can keep out rushing water from distant lands", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Hardened ceilings are typically designed to withstand extreme weather conditions and protect against aerial threats such as missiles or bombs. While rushing water from distant lands could potentially cause damage to a building, it is unlikely that a hardened ceiling would be specifically designed to prevent this type of threat. On the other hand, swift and quick aerial drones from distant lands pose a more realistic threat in today's world, making it a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "To repair a dented automobile bumper at home.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use boiling water and a hair dryer to heat the plastic bumper, making sure to keep the water and hair dryer far apart to avoid electric shock, then, from below, press it back into shape with a baseball bat. (B) Use boiling water and a hair dryer to heat the plastic bumper, making sure to keep the water and hair dryer close together to cause electric shock, then, from below, press it back into shape with a baseball bat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Use boiling water and a hair dryer to heat the plastic bumper, making sure to keep the water and hair dryer far apart to avoid electric shock, then, from below, press it back into shape with a baseball bat.\n\nExplanation: Heating the plastic bumper with boiling water and a hair dryer can help to soften the plastic and make it more pliable, allowing it to be reshaped. However, it is important to keep the water and hair dryer far apart to avoid any risk of electric shock. Using a baseball bat from below can help to push the bumper back into shape. Option B is not a plausible answer as it suggests intentionally causing an electric shock, which is dangerous and could cause harm to the person attempting the repair."}}
{"Q": "Make gourmet marshmallows.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Stuff marshmallows with peanut butter before roasting. (B) Stuff marshmallows with salt before roasting.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Stuff marshmallows with peanut butter before roasting.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because peanut butter is a common and popular ingredient that pairs well with marshmallows. The creamy texture and nutty flavor of the peanut butter will complement the sweetness of the marshmallows. On the other hand, stuffing marshmallows with salt before roasting may not be as appealing to most people as it can make the marshmallows too salty and overpowering."}}
{"Q": "Butcher Shop", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) will decimate fish from the ocean into digestible pieces (B) will decimate a full cow into digestible pieces", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) will decimate a full cow into digestible pieces.\nExplanation: While some butcher shops may offer fish, it is unlikely that they would be decimating fish from the ocean on a regular basis. On the other hand, it is common for butcher shops to offer beef and other meats, and it is plausible that they would be breaking down a full cow into smaller, more manageable pieces for customers to purchase."}}
{"Q": "How to cook meat on a fire pit without a grill?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gather a large and flat rock, clean it and lay it on the coals, once it heats up place the meat directly on the rock (B) Gather a small and sharp rock, clean it and lay it on the coals, before it heats up place the meat directly on the rock", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Gather a large and flat rock, clean it and lay it on the coals, once it heats up place the meat directly on the rock.\n\nExplanation: This method is more plausible because a large and flat rock can retain heat for a longer period of time, allowing the meat to cook evenly. A small and sharp rock may not provide enough surface area for the meat to cook properly and may also pose a safety hazard. Additionally, cleaning the rock before use is important to ensure that there are no harmful substances or bacteria on it that could contaminate the meat."}}
{"Q": "machete", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can lay on the tablecloth  (B) can fold a tablecloth ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a machete can lay on a tablecloth rather than fold it, as a machete is a long and flat object that cannot be easily folded."}}

{"Q": "Is there a product that helps keep dirt and grime from sticking to my car?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Yes, you can try Water Armour. It helps with tar and grime and makes cleaning easier. (B) Yes, you can try putting baby oil on your car and it will repel things from sticking to your car.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Water Armour is a real product that is designed to protect your car's paint from dirt, grime, and tar. It creates a hydrophobic barrier that repels water and other substances, making it easier to clean your car and keep it looking new. Baby oil, on the other hand, is not a practical solution for repelling dirt and grime from your car's surface. It may even attract more dirt and dust, making your car look even dirtier."}}
{"Q": "What can you use to sound dampen your room?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) You can use foam panels and securely hang them on your wall. (B) You can use a foam mattress and rip it apart and glue it to your wall.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. You can use foam panels and securely hang them on your wall.\nExplanation: Foam panels are a common and effective way to sound dampen a room. They are designed specifically for this purpose and are easy to install. Simply hang them on your walls using adhesive or screws. Foam mattresses, on the other hand, are not designed for soundproofing and may not be as effective.

Storing brushes in the container will keep them organized and easily accessible."}}
{"Q": "how to store summer fruit for winter", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Buy fruit that is almost spoiled and freeze it for winter baking. (B) Buy fruit at its peak and freeze it for winter baking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Buy fruit at its peak and freeze it for winter baking.\n\nExplanation: Buying fruit at its peak ensures that it is at its freshest and most flavorful. Freezing the fruit at this point will preserve its quality and taste for use in winter baking. Freezing almost spoiled fruit may result in a lower quality product and may not be safe for consumption. It is important to properly store the frozen fruit in airtight containers or freezer bags to prevent freezer burn and maintain freshness."}}
{"Q": "Remove musty smell from room.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Fill up a mason jar with two cups of rice and 10 drops of essential oil. (B) Fill up a mason jar with five cups of rice and 10 drops of essential oil.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Option A seems more plausible as it requires less rice and still has the same amount of essential oil. Rice is known to absorb moisture and odors, and the essential oil will help to add a pleasant scent to the room. However, it is important to note that this method may only work for mild musty smells and may not be effective for more severe cases. It is also important to address the root cause of the musty smell, such as moisture or mold, to prevent it from returning."}}
{"Q": "How can I easily add decorative feathers to a dream catcher?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cut a feather boa into similar lengths and hang them from the bottom of the dream catcher with fishing line. (B) Shred a feather boa into tiny bits and hang them from the bottom of the dream catcher with fishing line.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cut a feather boa into similar lengths and hang them from the bottom of the dream catcher with fishing line.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it involves cutting the feather boa into similar lengths, which will create a cohesive and uniform look. Hanging them from the bottom of the dream catcher with fishing line will also ensure that they are securely attached and won't fall off easily. Shredding a feather boa into tiny bits may create a messy and uneven look, and it may be difficult to attach them securely to the dream catcher."}}
{"Q": "To make the monkeys ears on the monkey cupcake", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Take two mini vanilla wafers and place them out to either side letting the wafer hang off the monkeys head. (B) Take two bananas and place them under either side letting the banana hang off the monkeys mouth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Take two mini vanilla wafers and place them out to either side letting the wafer hang off the monkey's head.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it involves using a food item that is commonly used in baking and decorating desserts. Mini vanilla wafers can easily be found in grocery stores and are a suitable size for the monkey's ears. Bananas, on the other hand, are not a suitable option for making ears as they are too soft and would not hold their shape. Additionally, placing bananas under the monkey's mouth would not create the desired effect of ears."}}
{"Q": "To shape the Popsicle sticks into a sunflower shape.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Glue the Popsicle sticks to an embroidery ring. (B) Tie the Popsicle sticks together using string.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Glue the Popsicle sticks to an embroidery ring.\nExplanation: Gluing the Popsicle sticks to an embroidery ring will provide a sturdy base for shaping the sticks into a sunflower shape.

This is because the cooler temperature slows down the activity of the yeast and other ingredients, which helps the dough to firm up and become easier to work with. Chilling the dough in the closet would not be effective as the temperature is likely to be too warm and inconsistent."}}
{"Q": "make a bowling game in the yard.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Set up some spice jars on a driveway into a bowling triangle. use a golf ball to try to knock down all of the spices. (B) Gather some large coffee cans for the pins and a soccer ball for the bowling ball and then set it up as a bowling lane.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer as it uses materials that are more suitable for a bowling game in the yard. Large coffee cans can be easily found and are sturdy enough to be used as pins. A soccer ball is also a good choice for a bowling ball as it is large enough to knock down the pins and can be easily rolled on a grassy surface. Option A may not be as practical as it requires small spice jars that may not be stable enough to withstand the impact of a golf ball."}}
{"Q": "where is the constellaiton Octons located", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Octans is a faint constellation in the southern and northern sky, most notable for containing the south celestial pole. (B) Octans is a faint constellation in the southern sky, most notable for containing the south celestial pole.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Octans is a faint constellation in the southern sky, most notable for containing the south celestial pole.\n\nExplanation: Octans is a small and faint constellation located in the southern hemisphere. It is best known for containing the south celestial pole, which makes it an important reference point for astronomers and navigators in the southern hemisphere. While Octans is not very prominent, it is still visible from most locations in the southern hemisphere, especially during the winter months. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it accurately describes the location and significance of the constellation Octans."}}
{"Q": "To determine how much iodine needs to be added to test the water for drink-ability.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) If the water is cloudy add more drops. (B) If the water is clear add more drops.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) If the water is clear add more drops.\nExplanation: Iodine is added to water to test for the presence of bacteria and other harmful microorganisms. If the water is clear, it means that there are fewer impurities in the water and therefore fewer microorganisms. Adding more drops of iodine will help to ensure that any remaining microorganisms are detected. If the water is cloudy, it may already contain a high level of impurities and adding more drops of iodine may not accurately reflect the drinkability of the water."}}

Enjoy.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because meringue is traditionally made with egg whites, not whole eggs. Additionally, the baking temperature of 275 degrees in option B is too low for meringue, which typically requires a higher temperature to properly set and brown. Option A also includes the important step of letting the egg whites come to room temperature before beating, which helps them to whip up better and create a more stable meringue."}}
{"Q": "piece of nylon pantyhose", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cover face  (B) cover building ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Using a piece of nylon pantyhose to cover a building is more plausible than using it to cover a face. Nylon pantyhose can be used as a protective covering for buildings during construction or renovation to prevent debris and dust from entering the building. It can also be used to cover windows during a storm to prevent damage from flying debris. On the other hand, using a piece of nylon pantyhose to cover a face is not a practical or safe option as it can obstruct breathing and vision."}}
{"Q": "Remove hair from kitchen drain.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Pour full 2 liter bottle of coke soda down kitchen drain. (B) Pour full 2 liter bottle of club soda down kitchen drain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Pour full 2 liter bottle of club soda down kitchen drain.\nExplanation: Club soda contains carbonic acid which can break down hair and other organic materials that may be clogging the drain. The carbonation in the soda can also help to loosen and flush out any debris. Coke soda may also have some acidic properties, but it is not as effective as club soda for this purpose. Additionally, pouring a full 2 liter bottle of any liquid down the drain may not be necessary and could potentially cause other issues. It is best to use a moderate amount of club soda and follow up with hot water to fully clear the drain."}}
{"Q": "To keep plants watered while on vacation.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Simply roll up some paper towels as tight as possible without them breaking, dunk the ends in a glass of water, and lay the remaining across the soil so that each plant is at least a few yards away. (B) Simply roll up some paper towels as tight as possible without them breaking, dunk the ends in a glass of water, and lay the remaining across the soil so that each plant is at least a few inches away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible as it suggests laying the paper towels a few inches away from each plant, which would allow the water to seep into the soil and reach the roots. Option A suggests laying the paper towels a few yards away, which would not effectively water the plants. Additionally, dunking the ends of the paper towels in a glass of water would provide enough moisture to keep the plants hydrated for a short period of time."}}
{"Q": "sticks", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can poke jello  (B) can poke DNA ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Sticks can poke DNA because DNA is a physical substance that can be manipulated with a tool like a stick.

(B) take the phone into a coffee shop and use the free power.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) take the phone into a coffee shop and use the free power.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it is safer and more reliable than asking a stranger on the street to charge the phone. In a coffee shop, there are usually outlets available for customers to use, and it is a more secure environment. Additionally, many coffee shops offer free Wi-Fi, which can be used to stay connected while the phone charges."}}
{"Q": "fertilizer", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can be used for  growing plants  (B) can be used for  growing rocks ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Fertilizers are substances that are added to soil or plants to provide essential nutrients for their growth and development. Plants require nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are often lacking in soil. Fertilizers provide these nutrients to plants, helping them to grow and produce healthy fruits, vegetables, and flowers. On the other hand, rocks do not require nutrients for growth, so it is not plausible to use fertilizers for growing rocks."}}

(B) Spray packing peanuts with perfume and put in empty jar.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Spray packing peanuts with perfume and put in empty jar.\nExplanation: Using gasoline as an air freshener is not safe and can be hazardous. On the other hand, using perfume to freshen the air is a common practice and is a more plausible option. The packing peanuts can absorb the perfume and release the fragrance slowly, making it a cost-effective and easy DIY air freshener."}}
{"Q": "How to wash your face?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Wet your face with the sink. Put some gentle soap onto your hands and massage it into your face evenly.

Use the water from the sink to rinse the soap off.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Wetting your face with the sink is the first step in washing your face. However, using gentle soap specifically made for facial cleansing is recommended as it is formulated to be gentle on the skin. Dish soap, on the other hand, is not formulated for facial use and can be harsh and drying on the skin. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}

Lay old side of wooden baby crib against the wall.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because a magazine holder is typically mounted on a wall for easy access and organization. By laying the old side of a wooden baby crib against the wall, it can serve as a sturdy and decorative magazine holder. Laying it on the floor would not be practical for accessing and organizing magazines."}}
{"Q": "hands", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can touch water  (B) can touch fire ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Hands can touch water.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that hands can touch water as water is a common substance that can be found in many places, such as in lakes, rivers, and oceans. Additionally, water is not typically harmful to touch, whereas fire can cause burns and other injuries."}}
{"Q": "how do you pick up toys?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) hold them in your hands. (B) put them all away in their own spots.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Putting toys away in their own spots not only helps with organization and cleanliness, but also teaches children responsibility and the importance of taking care of their belongings. Holding them in your hands may not be practical or efficient, especially if there are many toys to pick up."}}
{"Q": "rope", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can be put around a wall  (B) can be put around a pillar ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible for a rope to be put around a pillar than a wall. Walls are typically flat and do not provide a secure grip for a rope, while pillars are cylindrical and can easily hold a rope in place. Additionally, pillars are often used as support structures and may be designed specifically to accommodate ropes or other types of fasteners."}}

(B) cut a hole in the cork on top.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) take the cork out of the top.\nExplanation: To open a wine bottle, the most common and practical method is to use a corkscrew to remove the cork from the top of the bottle. This can be done by inserting the screw into the center of the cork and twisting it until the cork is pulled out. Cutting a hole in the cork on top is not a recommended method as it can damage the cork and potentially contaminate the wine."}}
{"Q": "broom", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can clean up water spills (B) can clean up dry coffee ground spills", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Brooms are typically used for cleaning up dry spills such as coffee grounds, dirt, or crumbs. While some brooms may have the ability to sweep up water, it is not their primary function and may not be as effective as using a mop or absorbent towel. Therefore, it is more plausible that a broom can clean up dry coffee ground spills."}}

(B) Find the thumbs up button, below and slightly to the right of the video. Right click it once.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Find the thumbs down button, below and slightly to the right of the video. Left click it once.\nExplanation: The thumbs down button is the symbol for disliking a video on YouTube. It is located below and slightly to the right of the video, and can be easily clicked with a left mouse button. Right-clicking the thumbs up button, as suggested in option B, will not result in disliking the video."}}
{"Q": "Squeeze a lemon wedge into a drink.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Taking the lemon wedge in between your hands, hold it over the drink and squeeze your hands together, letting the juice drip out into the drink. (B) Taking the lemon wedge lengthwise in between your fingers, hold it over the drink and squeeze the ends inward towards the thicker center.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Taking the lemon wedge lengthwise in between your fingers, hold it over the drink and squeeze the ends inward towards the thicker center.\n\nExplanation: This method is more plausible because it allows for more control over the amount of juice being squeezed out of the lemon wedge. Squeezing the ends inward towards the thicker center also helps to release more juice from the lemon. Holding the lemon wedge lengthwise in between your fingers also allows for a better grip and prevents the lemon from slipping out of your hands."}}

(B) scrub it all and then run an empty cycle with cold soapy water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Scrub it all and then run an empty cycle with hot soapy water.\n\nExplanation: Hot water is more effective in breaking down grease and grime, which is commonly found in dishwashers. Running an empty cycle with hot soapy water will help to remove any remaining debris and sanitize the dishwasher. Cold water may not be as effective in removing grease and grime, and may not sanitize the dishwasher as well."}}

If you want to get cash, simply buy something for .99 like a soda, and get cash back from the cashier that way you have ZERO ATM fees.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because many stores offer cash back options when making a purchase, and buying something small like a soda for .99 cents is a quick and easy way to get cash without incurring any ATM fees. Buying a motorcycle for 999.99 just to get cash back is not a practical or reasonable solution."}}

{"Q": "Add shine to microwave.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Clean interior with lemon oil. (B) Clean exterior with lemon oil.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Clean exterior with lemon oil.\nExplanation: Adding shine to the microwave is more likely to be achieved by cleaning the exterior with lemon oil. The exterior of the microwave is usually made of stainless steel or plastic, which can accumulate fingerprints, smudges, and other stains over time. Lemon oil is a natural cleaner and polish that can remove these stains and leave a shiny finish on the surface. Cleaning the interior with lemon oil is not recommended as it may leave a residue that can affect the taste and smell of food cooked in the microwave."}}

{"Q": "How to properly dry and clean a knife?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After rising the knife with water and soap, use a kitchen towel and then a piece of paper towel to dry the knife (B) After rising the knife with water and soap, use a standard towel to dry and polish the knife properly", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. After rising the knife with water and soap, use a kitchen towel and then a piece of paper towel to dry the knife.\nExplanation: Using a kitchen towel to dry the knife after washing it with soap and water is a good practice as it is clean and absorbent. However, using a piece of paper towel after the kitchen towel ensures that any remaining moisture is removed, leaving the knife completely dry. Using a standard towel (option B) may not be as effective as it may leave lint or fibers on the knife, which can be unsanitary and affect the knife's performance."}}
{"Q": "marker", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) erases  pencil marks (B) instead of pencil ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Instead of pencil.\nExplanation: Markers are typically used as an alternative to pencils for writing or drawing on surfaces such as paper, whiteboards, or posters. While some markers may have an eraser on the opposite end, it is not their primary function and they are not typically used to erase pencil marks. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}

Many people may choose to stay home or attend other events on popular holidays, leaving the theme park less crowded. Additionally, some theme parks may offer extended hours or special events on holidays, which can also help to spread out the crowds. Going to the theme park a day after a drinking based holiday, as suggested in option A, is not a reliable strategy as it may not have any impact on the crowds at the park."}}

{"Q": "How can I remove the green tops off a strawberry in one easy step?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a straw to poke suck out  the top of the berry and poke out the green top. (B) Use a straw to poke through the top of the berry and poke out the green top.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Use a straw to poke through the top of the berry and poke out the green top.\nExplanation: This method is more plausible because it involves poking through the top of the berry and pushing out the green top, rather than trying to suck it out with a straw. Sucking out the top may not be effective and could result in damaging the berry. Poking through the top with a straw is a quick and easy way to remove the green top without damaging the rest of the berry."}}
{"Q": "To keep necklaces from getting tangled when traveling.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Loop the necklaces through a straw and close the clasp so they won't get tangled. (B) Loop the necklaces through an earring and close the clasp so they won't get tangled.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Loop the necklaces through a straw and close the clasp so they won't get tangled.\n\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because using a straw to keep necklaces from getting tangled is a common and effective method.

Take your vase and add water, then take your bouquet of flowers, one at a time, and cut the bottom of the stem at a 45 degree angle to the appropriate size for the flower to fit in the vase and then place each flower into the vase gently working from the outside in.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because cutting the stem at a 45 degree angle allows for better water absorption and keeps the flowers fresher for longer. Tearing the stem with your hands can damage the stem and prevent proper water absorption. Additionally, placing the flowers gently from the outside in allows for a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing arrangement."}}
{"Q": "How to improve your jaw in boxing", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Practice being hit in the head to develop a tolerance to being hit. (B) Work on the muscles of the head and neck to make yourself stronger.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Work on the muscles of the head and neck to make yourself stronger.\nExplanation: Developing a tolerance to being hit in the head is not a safe or effective way to improve your jaw in boxing. Instead, working on the muscles of the head and neck through exercises such as neck bridges, resistance band exercises, and neck curls can help strengthen the jaw and reduce the risk of injury. This approach focuses on building strength and resilience in the muscles rather than simply enduring pain."}}
{"Q": "To cut through a plastic strip, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a pair of tweezers (B) Use a pair of snips", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Use a pair of snips.\nExplanation: Snips are designed to cut through various materials, including plastic. Tweezers, on the other hand, are not designed for cutting and may not be strong enough to cut through a plastic strip. Therefore, using a pair of snips is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "To clean inner tubes, you can", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Place them into a washer and run them on a cycle (B) Place them into a dryer and run them on a cycle", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Place them into a washer and run them on a cycle.\nExplanation: Placing inner tubes into a washer and running them on a cycle is a more plausible answer as it allows for the tubes to be cleaned thoroughly without causing any damage. The washer can be set to a gentle cycle with mild detergent and warm water to remove any dirt or debris from the tubes. Placing them into a dryer, on the other hand, can cause damage to the tubes due to the heat and tumbling action."}}

{"Q": "Stop a key from sticking in a lock, or from being difficult to put into a lock.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a paper towel and apply some glue to the key.  Wipe the key almost clean, a small amount of glue will be left behind allowing the key to slide in and out easily. (B) Use a paper towel and apply some oil to the key.  Wipe the key almost clean, a small amount of oil will be left behind allowing the key to slide in and out easily.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Use a paper towel and apply some oil to the key. Wipe the key almost clean, a small amount of oil will be left behind allowing the key to slide in and out easily.\n\nExplanation: Applying oil to the key is a common and effective method to prevent it from sticking in a lock or being difficult to insert. Oil acts as a lubricant, reducing friction between the key and the lock mechanism. This makes it easier to insert and turn the key. Using glue, on the other hand, is not a recommended solution as it can cause damage to the lock and make it even more difficult to use."}}
{"Q": "How to make a wrist corsage.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cut a length of velvet ribbon long enough to wrap around the wrist. Make a small slit in the center for the flower stem. Choose a blossom and cut the stem. Tuck the blossom through the slit in the ribbon. (B) Cut a length of sewing thread long enough to wrap around the wrist. Make a small slit in the center for the flower stem. Choose a blossom and cut the stem. Tuck the blossom through the slit in the thread.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cut a length of velvet ribbon long enough to wrap around the wrist. Make a small slit in the center for the flower stem. Choose a blossom and cut the stem. Tuck the blossom through the slit in the ribbon.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because velvet ribbon is a common material used for wrist corsages and provides a sturdy base for the flower. Sewing thread is not a suitable material for a wrist corsage as it is too thin and fragile to hold the weight of a flower. Additionally, tucking the stem through a slit in the ribbon is a secure way to attach the flower to the corsage, while tucking it through a slit in thread may cause the flower to fall off easily."}}
{"Q": "how do you stop a stomach from growling?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) take a shower to soothe the growling. (B) do not allow yourself to get hungry, by eating.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) do not allow yourself to get hungry, by eating.\nExplanation: Stomach growling is a natural bodily function that occurs when the stomach and intestines contract and move air and food through the digestive system. The best way to prevent stomach growling is to eat regularly and not allow yourself to get too hungry. Eating small, frequent meals throughout the day can help keep your stomach satisfied and prevent excessive growling. Taking a shower may temporarily distract you from the sound of your stomach, but it will not address the underlying cause of the growling."}}

{"Q": "To chop parsley", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) To chop parsley without bruising it remove tough stems and fold leaves into a bundle. With finger tips pointed inward, slice in rocking motion with a very sharp knife, crisscrossing with knife until finely chopped. (B) To chop parsley without bruising it remove tough leaves and fold stems into a bundle. With finger tips pointed inward, slice in rocking motion with a very sharp knife, crisscrossing with knife until finely chopped.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. To chop parsley without bruising it remove tough stems and fold leaves into a bundle. With finger tips pointed inward, slice in rocking motion with a very sharp knife, crisscrossing with knife until finely chopped.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because parsley stems are not tough, but the leaves can be. By folding the leaves into a bundle, it makes it easier to chop evenly. The finger tips should be pointed inward to protect them from the sharp knife. The rocking motion with a sharp knife will help to finely chop the parsley without bruising it. Crisscrossing with the knife will ensure that all the parsley is chopped evenly."}}

{"Q": "Remove pantry smell.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Leave a bowl of coffee grounds in pantry. (B) Leave a bowl of beans in pantry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Leave a bowl of coffee grounds in pantry.\nExplanation: Coffee grounds have a strong and pleasant aroma that can help absorb and neutralize unpleasant odors in the pantry. The porous nature of coffee grounds allows them to absorb the odor molecules, leaving the pantry smelling fresh and clean. On the other hand, leaving a bowl of beans in the pantry may not be as effective in removing the smell, as beans do not have a strong odor-neutralizing property."}}

It also suggests doing it in daylight to be seen, which can attract unwanted attention and potentially lead to legal trouble."}}
{"Q": "To make a ball of \"yarn\" out of fabric from an old piece of knit clothing.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cut thin strips in a spiral shape and wind into ball. (B) Cut thin strips in a square shape and wind into ball.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cut thin strips in a spiral shape and wind into ball.\nExplanation: Cutting thin strips in a spiral shape will create a continuous strand of fabric that can be easily wound into a ball. Cutting strips in a square shape may result in shorter strands that are more difficult to wind into a cohesive ball. Additionally, cutting in a spiral shape will allow for a more uniform thickness throughout the ball, whereas cutting in a square shape may result in varying thicknesses."}}
{"Q": "How do you make your trash cans smell better?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put a sock filled with other socks and spray them with hot sauce. Leave this in the trash can. (B) Put a sock filled with other socks and spray them with perfume. Leave this in the trash can.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Put a sock filled with other socks and spray them with perfume. Leave this in the trash can.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because perfume has a pleasant scent that can mask the unpleasant odor of trash. The sock filled with other socks can absorb any excess moisture in the trash can, preventing the growth of bacteria that can cause bad smells. However, it is important to note that regularly taking out the trash and cleaning the trash can is the most effective way to keep it smelling fresh."}}

Place a fine mesh strainer/sieve over a large bowl and add the flour, baking powder and salt. Tap side of sieve to sift ingredients into the bowl and continue until sieve is empty.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it instructs the reader to sift the ingredients until the sieve is empty, ensuring that all of the dry ingredients are properly sifted and incorporated into the mixture. Option B, on the other hand, instructs the reader to sift until the sieve is full, which could result in uneven sifting and clumps of dry ingredients remaining in the sieve."}}
{"Q": "How to attract hummingbirds to your garden?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Hummingbirds are territorial so it is best to have several different feeders or patches of flowers that hummingbirds will be attracted to. Otherwise they might fight and they will leave and not want to return. (B) If you hum a tune while you garden, humming birds will want to sing along with you so you don't have to really bother with feeders or special flowers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Hummingbirds are territorial so it is best to have several different feeders or patches of flowers that hummingbirds will be attracted to. Otherwise they might fight and they will leave and not want to return.\n\nExplanation: Hummingbirds are known to be territorial and will defend their feeding and nesting areas from other hummingbirds. By providing multiple feeders or patches of flowers, you can attract more hummingbirds without causing territorial disputes. Additionally, it is important to choose flowers that are rich in nectar and brightly colored to catch the attention of hummingbirds. Providing a water source, such as a bird bath or fountain, can also attract hummingbirds to your garden. Hummingbirds are attracted to the sound of running water and will use it to bathe and drink."}}

Place the water in the microwave for one to two minutes.\nExplanation: Placing water in the microwave for one to two hours is not a practical solution as it would take too long and may even cause the water to evaporate completely. On the other hand, placing the water in the microwave for one to two minutes is a more plausible answer as it can quickly heat up the water to a temperature that is hot enough to clean jewelry. However, it is important to note that the exact time needed may vary depending on the power of the microwave and the amount of water being heated."}}
{"Q": "To remove the seeds from a butternut squash", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a large spatula to scrape away seeds (B) Use a large spoon to scrape away seeds", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Use a large spoon to scrape away seeds.\n\nExplanation: Using a large spoon to scrape away the seeds is a more plausible answer as it is a common method used by many people. A spatula may not be as effective in removing the seeds as it may not be able to reach all the crevices. A spoon, on the other hand, can easily scoop out the seeds and the stringy flesh attached to them. Additionally, a spoon is less likely to damage the flesh of the squash compared to a spatula."}}

{"Q": "fist", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) grips house  (B) grips spoon ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: grips spoon\nExplanation: It is more plausible for someone to grip a spoon than a house. Gripping a spoon is a common action when eating or cooking, while gripping a house is not a typical action."}}
{"Q": "To clean a thermos without putting it in the dishwasher.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Fill it with soap water and shake and let it sit on each end for a few hours. (B) Fill it with water from a dirty pan and shake and let it sit on each end for a few hours.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Filling the thermos with soap water and shaking it will help to loosen any residue or stains inside the thermos. Letting it sit on each end for a few hours will allow the soap water to penetrate and clean the entire surface of the thermos. Using water from a dirty pan may transfer the dirt and grime from the pan into the thermos, making it even dirtier. Therefore, option A is a more plausible and effective way to clean a thermos without using a dishwasher."}}
{"Q": "What supplies are needed to make a vinyl record door curtain?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Wooden plank cut to size of door frame    Heavyweight picture hangers    Heavyweight hanging eyes    Heavyweight string or ribbon    About 40 old records (depending on door size and user error)    Superglue    Dremel, drill, or punch and hammer    An empty door frame that can support a curtain    Protective surface that can be drilled or hammered on (B) Wooden plank cut to size of door frame    Heavyweight picture hangers    Heavyweight hanging eyes    Heavyweight string or ribbon    About 40 old records (depending on door size and user error)    Superglue    Dremel, drill, or punch and hammer    An empty picture frame that can support a curtain    Protective surface that can be drilled or hammered on", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Wooden plank cut to size of door frame, heavyweight picture hangers, heavyweight hanging eyes, heavyweight string or ribbon, about 40 old records (depending on door size and user error), superglue, Dremel, drill, or punch and hammer, an empty door frame that can support a curtain, protective surface that can be drilled or hammered on.\n\nExplanation: The vinyl record door curtain requires a wooden plank cut to the size of the door frame, heavyweight picture hangers, heavyweight hanging eyes, heavyweight string or ribbon, about 40 old records, superglue, Dremel, drill, or punch and hammer, an empty door frame that can support a curtain, and a protective surface that can be drilled or hammered on. The wooden plank serves as the base for the curtain, while the picture hangers, hanging eyes, and string or ribbon are used to hang the records. The records are attached to the plank using superglue and a Dremel, drill, or punch and hammer. An empty door frame that can support a curtain is necessary to hang the vinyl record door curtain, and a protective surface is needed to prevent damage while drilling or hammering. Option B is not plausible because a picture frame may not be strong enough to support the weight of the vinyl records."}}
{"Q": "How can I keep all my small bit organized?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use the box from a beading kit, and instead of beads, fill it with nuts and bolts. (B) Use the string from a beading kit, and tie your nuts and bolts into bundles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Use the box from a beading kit, and instead of beads, fill it with nuts and bolts.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because the box from a beading kit is designed to hold small items and has compartments to keep them organized. By filling it with nuts and bolts, you can easily sort them by size or type and keep them in one place. Using a string to tie them into bundles may work temporarily, but it can become messy and difficult to keep track of which bundle contains which type of nut or bolt."}}
{"Q": "How can I get rid of the ant problem in my bedroom?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Borax will kill odorous house ants, and powdered sugar will attract them. Make a homemade ant bait by thoroughly mixing one part borax with 3 parts powdered sugar. Fill tiny containers (such as bottle caps) with this homemade ant bait and place them as close to the place where you suspect ants are entering your house. (B) Borax will kill odorous house ants, and powdered milk will attract them. Make a homemade ant bait by thoroughly mixing one part borax with 3 parts powdered sugar. Fill tiny containers (such as bottle caps) with this homemade ant bait and place them as close to the place where you suspect ants are entering your house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Borax is a common household item that is effective in killing ants. Mixing it with powdered sugar will attract the ants to the bait, and once they consume it, the borax will kill them. Powdered milk is not a common attractant for ants, so it is less likely to be effective in luring them to the bait. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How to puncture a hole in the bottom of a soda can.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Take a dart and drive it through the side. (B) Take a dart and drive it through the bottom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Take a dart and drive it through the bottom.\nExplanation: Puncturing a hole through the side of a soda can would not allow the liquid to flow out properly as the hole would not be at the lowest point of the can. Puncturing a hole through the bottom of the can would allow the liquid to flow out smoothly and efficiently. However, it is important to exercise caution and use appropriate tools to avoid injury."}}
{"Q": "How to smooth edges of wooden leaves.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Run a dremel tool over the sharp edges of the leaf. (B) Run a saw over the sharp edges of the leaf.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Run a dremel tool over the sharp edges of the leaf.\nExplanation: A dremel tool is a rotary tool that can be used to sand and smooth edges of wood. It is a more precise tool than a saw and can be used to create a smooth and polished finish on the edges of wooden leaves. Running a saw over the edges may create rough and uneven edges, which is not desirable for a smooth finish. Therefore, using a dremel tool is a more plausible answer for smoothing the edges of wooden leaves."}}

(B) umbrella, cardboard, masking tape, acrylic paint, and textile medium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: To paint an umbrella, you will need an umbrella as the base, acrylic paint, and textile medium to make the paint adhere to the fabric. You will also need cardboard to protect the surface you are working on and masking tape to create clean lines. Bricks and concrete walkway are not necessary for this project."}}
{"Q": "How can I charge my phone in a hotel room if I forgot my charger?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There is usually a USB plug-in on the back of the hotel alarm clock. (B) There is usually a USB plug-in on the back of the hotel television.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There is usually a USB plug-in on the back of the hotel alarm clock.\nExplanation: Many hotels provide alarm clocks with USB ports for guests to charge their devices. This is a common feature in many hotels, and it is more likely to be available than a USB port on the back of the television. It is always a good idea to check the back of the alarm clock or ask the hotel staff for assistance."}}
{"Q": "How do you make a snow ball?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scoop up a large amount of snow with a shovel. Use one hand to pack it together, twisting it as you go. (B) Scoop up a handful of snow with one hand. Use both hands to pack it together, turning it as you go.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Scooping up a large amount of snow with a shovel (option A) may result in a snowball that is too big and difficult to handle. Using one hand to pack it together may also not be enough to create a solid snowball. Option B, on the other hand, allows for better control and precision in shaping the snowball. Using both hands to pack the snow together and turning it as you go ensures that the snowball is compact and round."}}
{"Q": "How can I make playdough that my child can eat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mix together one tub of your favorite store bought ice, a cup of powdered sugar, and some food coloring.

Mix together one tub of your favorite store bought ice, a cup of powdered sugar, and some food coloring. Using your hands, knead the mixture until the texture is right, and you have playdough.\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer because it uses ice instead of icing, which is not safe for consumption. The powdered sugar and food coloring can be added to the ice to create a pliable dough-like texture that is safe for children to play with and eat. It is important to note that while this playdough is edible, it should not be consumed in large quantities and should be stored in the refrigerator to prevent spoilage."}}
{"Q": "To tidy up the pancake making process", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put the pancake mix in a used ketchup bottle. (B) Put the pancake mix in a clean ketchup bottle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Put the pancake mix in a clean ketchup bottle.\nExplanation: Using a clean ketchup bottle to store pancake mix can help to tidy up the pancake making process by providing a convenient and mess-free way to dispense the batter onto the griddle or pan. However, it is important to use a clean bottle to avoid any contamination or unwanted flavors from the previous contents of the bottle."}}
{"Q": "how do you put underwear on?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) pull them up over your legs. (B) pull them down over your chest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Pull them up over your legs.\nExplanation: This is the correct way to put on underwear. You step into the leg holes and pull them up over your hips and waist. Pulling them down over your chest is not a plausible answer as it would be uncomfortable and impractical."}}
{"Q": "To store your seasonal items,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) pack them neatly into plastic tubs and stack in a closet or slide under your bed. (B) pack them neatly into ceramic tubs and stack in a closet or slide under your bed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Plastic tubs are a more practical and affordable option for storing seasonal items as they are lightweight, durable, and can be easily stacked or slid under the bed or in a closet. Ceramic tubs, on the other hand, are heavier, more fragile, and can be more expensive, making them less practical for storage purposes."}}
{"Q": "how do you check if you're pregnant?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) feel your stomach (B) take a pregnancy test.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Take a pregnancy test.\nExplanation: Taking a pregnancy test is the most reliable way to check if you're pregnant. It detects the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine, which is produced by the placenta after a fertilized egg implants in the uterus. Feeling your stomach is not a reliable way to determine pregnancy as it can be influenced by other factors such as bloating or weight gain."}}

Cumin is also a common spice used in Chinese cuisine. Option B includes canned chili, which is not typically used in Chinese noodle soup recipes. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How to make Tropical Storm sauce at home.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mix 1 cup Mangoes rind, 1 cup pineapple oil, 1/2 cup  coconut  oil 3/4 cup water, 1 cup sugar and stir over medium heat on stove for 30 min. (B) Mix 1 cup chopped  Mangoes, 1 cup chopped pineapple, 1/2 cup chopped coconut 3/4 cup water, 1 cup sugar and stir over medium heat on stove for 30 min.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Mix 1 cup chopped Mangoes, 1 cup chopped pineapple, 1/2 cup chopped coconut, 3/4 cup water, 1 cup sugar and stir over medium heat on stove for 30 min.\nExplanation: This option includes chopped fruits instead of rinds and oils, which makes more sense for a sauce. The combination of mangoes, pineapple, and coconut is commonly used in tropical cuisine, and the addition of sugar and water will help create a syrupy consistency. Cooking the mixture over medium heat for 30 minutes will allow the flavors to blend and the sauce to thicken."}}
{"Q": "How long do you let the dough rise for the bread?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cover the dough and let rise for 3 minutes, once it has a slight dome to it, it's ready. (B) Cover the dough and let rise for 30 minutes, once it has a slight dome to it, it's ready.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Cover the dough and let rise for 30 minutes, once it has a slight dome to it, it's ready.\nExplanation: Bread dough needs time to rise and develop flavor. 30 minutes is a more plausible time for the dough to rise than just 3 minutes. The slight dome indicates that the dough has risen enough and is ready to be baked."}}
{"Q": "Prevent soggy microwave pizza.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Add a cup of milk next to pizza in microwave. (B) Add a cup of water next to pizza in microwave.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Add a cup of water next to pizza in microwave.\nExplanation: Adding a cup of water next to the pizza in the microwave creates steam, which helps to keep the pizza moist without making it soggy. Milk, on the other hand, may cause the pizza to become too moist and soggy. Therefore, adding water is a more plausible solution to prevent soggy microwave pizza."}}
{"Q": "To place a screw in a plastic lid, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a toothbrush (B) Use a drill", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Use a drill.\nExplanation: Using a toothbrush to place a screw in a plastic lid is not a plausible answer as a toothbrush is not a tool designed for screwing. On the other hand, using a drill is a more plausible answer as it is a tool designed for drilling holes and inserting screws.

{"Q": "What is the best way to apply nail polish to a professional result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A quick way to apply the nail polish is to use a fairly big brush, and then use flesh-colored nail polish to cover up any places that turned out messy. (B) Tape the cuticles with any kind of tape that has been cut to fit snugly around the nail. Then go ahead and paint the nails. Remove the tape and if you still got nail polish on your cuticle or fingers, dip a q-tip in nail polish remover and wipe the excess away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Taping the cuticles before painting the nails is a great way to ensure a clean and professional-looking result. It helps to prevent the nail polish from getting on the skin around the nails, which can be difficult to remove and can ruin the overall look. Using a q-tip dipped in nail polish remover to clean up any mistakes is also a good tip to achieve a neat finish. Using a big brush and flesh-colored nail polish to cover up mistakes is not a recommended method as it can result in a messy and uneven finish."}}

Remove with tongs, or drain in a colander, and immediately transfer to ice water for 1 minute to stop the cooking process.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer as asparagus only needs to be boiled for 3 to 4 minutes to become tender. Boiling for 34 minutes, as stated in option A, would result in overcooked and mushy asparagus. The step of immediately transferring the asparagus to ice water to stop the cooking process is also important to ensure that the asparagus retains its bright green color and crisp texture."}}
{"Q": "How to ensure the rice for a horchata drink has a smoky flavor?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Before blending the rice with the milk and spices, toast the rice on low heat in a pan for a few moments until browned (B) After blending the rice with the milk and spices, toast the rice on low heat in a pan for a few moments until browned", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Before blending the rice with the milk and spices, toast the rice on low heat in a pan for a few moments until browned.\n\nExplanation: Toasting the rice before blending it with the milk and spices will allow the rice to develop a smoky flavor. This is because toasting the rice will release its natural oils and enhance its nutty flavor. Toasting the rice after blending it with the milk and spices may not have the same effect as the rice will already be saturated with the other ingredients. Therefore, toasting the rice before blending is the more plausible answer to ensure a smoky flavor in the horchata drink."}}
{"Q": "Use healthy sandwich alternative for mayo.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use smashed avocado. (B) Use peanut butter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Use smashed avocado.\nExplanation: Smashed avocado is a healthier alternative to mayo as it is rich in healthy fats, fiber, and various nutrients. It also adds a creamy texture to the sandwich, making it a perfect replacement for mayo. On the other hand, peanut butter is high in calories and fat, which may not be suitable for people who are trying to maintain a healthy diet. Therefore, using smashed avocado as a healthy sandwich alternative for mayo is a more plausible option."}}
{"Q": "straw", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can be lit for fire to stay warm (B) can be lit for water to stay warm", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Straws are made of dried plant stems and are highly flammable.

Secure the opened top with a rubber band.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Lavender flowers are known for their calming and soothing properties, making them a popular choice for aromatherapy. Therefore, it makes more sense to use lavender flowers instead of rose flowers to fill a gnome's body. The process of bunching up the fabric and flowers into a ball shape and securing it with a rubber band is a common method for creating sachets or potpourri bags, which can be used to add fragrance to drawers, closets, or other small spaces. This method would work well for creating a lavender-filled gnome body."}}

{"Q": "can you use any oil for frying foods?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) yes, as long as the varieties are not mixed, or mixed with water. (B) If you use an inappropriate oil to deep-fry food, you could find that it ends up with a weird, off-putting taste", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. If you use an inappropriate oil to deep-fry food, you could find that it ends up with a weird, off-putting taste.\n\nExplanation: Not all oils are suitable for frying foods. Some oils have low smoke points, which means they break down and produce harmful compounds when heated to high temperatures. Using an inappropriate oil can also affect the taste and texture of the food. For example, using olive oil to deep-fry food can result in a bitter taste and a greasy texture. Therefore, it is important to choose the right oil for frying, such as canola oil, peanut oil, or vegetable oil, which have high smoke points and neutral flavors."}}
{"Q": "Create a frosting piping bag.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fill a grocery bag with frosting and cut one of the corners. (B) Fill a cereal bag with frosting and cut one of the corners.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Fill a pastry bag with frosting and attach a piping tip.\n\nExplanation: Using a grocery or cereal bag as a piping bag is not a safe or hygienic option as these bags are not designed for food use and may contain harmful chemicals. Instead, a pastry bag specifically designed for food use should be used. It can be filled with frosting and a piping tip can be attached to create different designs and shapes. This is a more plausible and safe option for creating a frosting piping bag."}}
{"Q": "How can I clean the grate of a bird cage?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use an old toothbrush and soap and water. (B) Use an old hairbrush and soap and water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Use an old toothbrush and soap and water.\nExplanation: Using an old toothbrush and soap and water is a more plausible answer as it allows for a more thorough cleaning of the grate. The bristles of a toothbrush can reach into the small crevices of the grate, removing any dirt or debris that may have accumulated. Additionally, soap and water can help to disinfect the grate, ensuring that it is clean and safe for the bird. Using an old hairbrush may not be as effective as the bristles may not be as firm or able to reach into small spaces."}}

{"Q": "Absorb car spills without napkins.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Store bed sheet in trunk to wipe spills up. (B) Store foil sheet in trunk to wipe spills up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Store bed sheet in trunk to wipe spills up.\nExplanation: Storing a bed sheet in the trunk is a more plausible option as it can be easily washed and reused multiple times. Foil sheets may not be as effective in absorbing spills and may tear easily, making them less practical for cleaning up spills in a car. Additionally, using a bed sheet is a more eco-friendly option as it reduces the need for disposable napkins."}}
{"Q": "Remove hair from hair brush.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cover brush head with pantyhose, use a pen to push down and collect hair. (B) Cover brush head with saran wrap, use a pen to push down and collect hair.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cover brush head with pantyhose, use a pen to push down and collect hair.\nExplanation: This method is more plausible because pantyhose have a finer mesh than saran wrap, which can better trap and collect hair. Additionally, using a pen to push down on the pantyhose can help to loosen and remove the hair from the brush bristles. Saran wrap may not be as effective in collecting hair and may tear or puncture during the process."}}
{"Q": "ice pick", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can poke through metal armor  (B) can poke through cloth ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: While an ice pick may be sharp enough to puncture metal armor, it is unlikely to have enough force behind it to actually penetrate the armor. On the other hand, it is much more plausible that an ice pick could easily poke through cloth, as cloth is a much softer and less durable material."}}

{"Q": "Reduce chances of vomiting.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Take short rapid breaths. (B) Take long rapid breaths.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Take short rapid breaths.\nExplanation: Taking short rapid breaths can help reduce the chances of vomiting by calming the body and reducing nausea. This technique is often used in yoga and meditation to help control the body's response to stress and anxiety. Taking long rapid breaths, on the other hand, can actually increase the chances of vomiting by hyperventilating and causing dizziness or lightheadedness. Therefore, taking short rapid breaths is a more plausible answer to reduce the chances of vomiting."}}

{"Q": "Why do some people get tongue tied?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Shyness is a common cause of awkward pauses in communications in certain social settings, or meeting people, but if the tongue is actually tied it may need surgical removal. (B) Shyness is the most common cause of becoming tongue tied. Perhaps find a group you feel comfortable with and practice small talk. There are peer groups you can join to help.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Shyness is a common cause of awkward pauses in communications in certain social settings, or meeting people, but if the tongue is actually tied it may need surgical removal.\n\nExplanation: While shyness can certainly contribute to becoming tongue tied, it is not the only cause. In some cases, people may have a condition called ankyloglossia, also known as tongue tie, where the frenulum (the tissue that connects the tongue to the floor of the mouth) is too short or tight, making it difficult to move the tongue properly. In severe cases, surgical removal may be necessary to improve speech and eating. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}

(B) dress like you do not care about your surroundings.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Dress like you want to be successful when you go out.\nExplanation: Dressing in a way that makes you feel confident and put-together can help boost your self-esteem and make you feel more comfortable in public. This doesn't necessarily mean dressing in formal or expensive clothing, but rather wearing something that makes you feel good about yourself and your appearance.

(B) jump up off the ground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: To hop, you need to jump up off the ground and move forward within the jump. This is different from just jumping up and down in the same spot, which would be option B. Hopping involves using your legs to propel yourself forward while in the air, and then landing on the opposite foot from the one you started on. It's a common movement in activities like hopscotch or basketball, and requires a bit of practice to master."}}
{"Q": "To reduce the amount of bubbles in concrete, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tap the concrete all over with a rubber mallet before pouring it (B) Tap the concrete all over with a rubber mallet after pouring it", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\n\nExplanation: Tapping the concrete all over with a rubber mallet before pouring it is a more plausible answer because it allows the air bubbles to escape before the concrete sets. Tapping the concrete after pouring it may actually create more bubbles and cause the concrete to become weaker. By tapping the concrete before pouring it, the bubbles are able to rise to the surface and escape, resulting in a stronger and more durable concrete."}}
{"Q": "How do you cut a baked polymer clay stick in order to make clay sprinkles?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Press a razor into the stick about 1/12 of an inch from the end of the stick.

Apply pressure until the razor slices completely through the clay stick.\n\nExplanation: In order to make clay sprinkles, the baked polymer clay stick needs to be cut into small pieces. Option (B) is the more plausible answer because it suggests slicing completely through the clay stick, which would result in small, individual pieces. Slicing partially through the stick, as suggested in option (A), would not result in small, individual pieces and may be more difficult to work with."}}
{"Q": "What do you use to make a DIY lotion bar smell good?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) You can use scented oils, about ten drops will do. (B) You can use oils and add as many drops as you'd like.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Adding scented oils to a DIY lotion bar is a common way to make it smell good. Ten drops of scented oil is usually enough to give a pleasant fragrance without overpowering the other ingredients. Adding too many drops of oil can make the lotion bar too strong-smelling and may even cause skin irritation. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What can I make fake eyeballs out of for my scarecrow?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use some ping pong balls as the eyeballs. (B) Use some olives as the eyeballs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Use some ping pong balls as the eyeballs.\nExplanation: Ping pong balls are a more plausible option as they are round and white, resembling the shape and color of eyeballs. Olives, on the other hand, are not a suitable option as they are too small and dark in color, making them look more like pupils than actual eyeballs. Additionally, ping pong balls are easy to find and can be painted or drawn on to create a more realistic look."}}
{"Q": "how to choose a watermelon", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Pick it up: Big or small, the watermelon should feel heavy for its size.    Look for the yellow spot: Watermelons develop a splotch where they rest on the ground. When this splotch is creamy yellow, it's ripe. (B) Pick it up: Big or small, the watermelon should feel heavy for its size.    Look for the black spot: Watermelons develop a splotch where they rest on the ground.

Look for the yellow spot: Watermelons develop a splotch where they rest on the ground. When this splotch is creamy yellow, it's ripe.\n\nExplanation: The weight of the watermelon is a good indicator of its ripeness as a ripe watermelon will have more water content, making it heavier. The yellow spot on the watermelon indicates that it has been ripening on the ground and is a good sign that it is ready to be eaten. The black spot mentioned in option B is not a reliable indicator of ripeness and may indicate rot or damage to the watermelon."}}
{"Q": "To cook lemon curd, you can", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cook for fifteen minutes, stirring every three minutes (B) Cook for fifteen hours, stirring every three hours", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cook for fifteen minutes, stirring every three minutes.\nExplanation: Cooking lemon curd for fifteen hours is not necessary and would likely result in overcooking and ruining the curd. Cooking for fifteen minutes, stirring every three minutes, allows for even cooking and prevents the curd from burning or sticking to the bottom of the pan. This method is commonly used for making lemon curd and has been tested and proven to work well."}}
{"Q": "How can I make sure a pitcher of lemonade doesn't get watered down?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Put ice in the individual glasses not the pitcher. (B) Put ice in the pitcher not in the individual glasses.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Put ice in the individual glasses not the pitcher.\n\nExplanation: By putting ice in the individual glasses instead of the pitcher, the ice will only melt in the glass that is being consumed, rather than melting in the entire pitcher. This will prevent the lemonade from getting watered down and ensure that each glass has the same level of sweetness and flavor. Additionally, this allows individuals to control the amount of ice they want in their drink, which can also affect the level of dilution."}}

The best way to feel a little bit better even if you are really down is to help somebody. \n\nExplanation: Helping others has been shown to increase feelings of happiness and well-being. When we help others, we feel a sense of purpose and connection to others, which can boost our mood and reduce feelings of loneliness or isolation. Additionally, helping others can give us a sense of accomplishment and pride, which can further enhance our mood. Snubbing somebody, on the other hand, is likely to lead to negative feelings and conflict, which can worsen our mood and overall well-being."}}
{"Q": "cave", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) keeps the boulders contained (B) keeps the mountain contained", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: A cave is typically a natural formation in the earth that is formed by erosion or other geological processes.

{"Q": "How do you make glow water?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Get a bottle of Mountain Dew and pour it into a glass till 1/4th of soda is left. Add a pinch of baking soda and few drops of hydrogen peroxide into the bottle. Shake the mixture properly. (B) Get a bottle of Mountain Dew and pour it into a glass till 1/4th of soda is left. Add a pinch of baking powder and few drops of hydrogen peroxide into the bottle. Shake the mixture properly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) reacts with the citric acid in Mountain Dew to produce carbon dioxide gas, which creates bubbles and makes the mixture fizz. When hydrogen peroxide is added, it reacts with the baking soda to produce oxygen gas, which causes the mixture to glow. Baking powder, on the other hand, contains baking soda and other ingredients such as cream of tartar and cornstarch, which may not react in the same way as pure baking soda. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How to make garlic bread.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Spread butter onto bread and sprinkle garlic powder, then bake in microwave. (B) Spread butter onto bread and sprinkle garlic powder, then bake in oven.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Spread butter onto bread and sprinkle garlic powder, then bake in oven.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because garlic bread is typically made by spreading butter and garlic onto bread and then baking it in the oven. Baking in the microwave may not give the bread the desired texture and flavor. Additionally, baking in the oven allows the bread to become crispy and golden brown."}}
{"Q": "tissues", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) wiping  noses cleanly (B) wiping  hands cleanly", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Tissues are commonly used for wiping noses cleanly, especially during cold and flu season.

{"Q": "To keep your pizza crust from getting chewy when you microwave it", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put a small amount of water in the microwave when you heat the pizza (B) Put a small glass of water in the microwave when you heat the pizza", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Put a small amount of water in the microwave when you heat the pizza.\n\nExplanation: Adding a small amount of water to the microwave when heating the pizza can help create steam, which can prevent the crust from becoming chewy. This is because the steam helps to keep the crust moist and soft, rather than drying it out. Putting a glass of water in the microwave may also work, but it is less precise and could potentially lead to spills or other issues. Therefore, option A is a more plausible and practical solution."}}
{"Q": "How can you neatly cut a cake?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Run the knife you use for cutting under hot water, dry the knife and cut, repeat as needed. (B) Run the knife you use for cutting under cold water, dry the knife and cut, repeat as needed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Run the knife you use for cutting under hot water, dry the knife and cut, repeat as needed.\nExplanation: Running the knife under hot water will help to heat up the blade, which will make it easier to cut through the cake without causing it to crumble or break apart. Additionally, drying the knife before cutting will help to prevent any excess moisture from getting onto the cake, which could also cause it to become soggy or fall apart. Repeating the process as needed will ensure that each slice is cut cleanly and neatly. Running the knife under cold water may cause the cake to stick to the blade, making it more difficult to cut and potentially causing it to break apart."}}
{"Q": "What can you do to the mold if you want to remove gummies easily later?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) You need to cover a mould with plastic wrap.

{"Q": "How can I blow up my air mattress with a shop vac?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) If you don’t have an air compressor to inflate your air mattresses or pool toys, you can use your shop vacuum instead, just pop the top off of a plastic squeeze bottle and fit the top to your vacuum’s hose. You may have to use duct tape. Once the top is secured to the hose, attach the hose to your vacuum’s exhaust port. It’ll blow up your inflatables in no time. To deflate, attach the hose to the vacuum port and suck the air out. (B) If you don’t have an air compressor to inflate your air mattresses or pool toys, you can use your shop vacuum instead, just pop the top off of a plastic squeeze bottle and fit the top to your vacuum’s hose. You may have to use duct tape. Once the top is secured to the hose, attach the hose to your vacuum’s suction port. It’ll blow up your inflatables in no time. To deflate, attach the hose to the vacuum port and suck the air out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests attaching the hose to the vacuum's exhaust port, which blows air out, rather than the suction port, which sucks air in. This method is similar to using a hair dryer on the cool setting to inflate an air mattress. The suction port would not be effective in inflating the air mattress."}}
{"Q": "How to flat a tortilla without a tortilla press?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a bowl,  make sure it is flat side up and press down firmly until the tortilla flattens out (B) Use a plate, make sure it is flat side down and press down firmly until the tortilla flattens out", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Use a bowl, make sure it is flat side up and press down firmly until the tortilla flattens out.\n\nExplanation: Using a bowl is a more plausible option as it provides a flat surface to press down on the tortilla. The flat side of the bowl ensures that the tortilla is evenly flattened out. Pressing down firmly on the bowl will help to flatten the tortilla to the desired thickness. Using a plate, on the other hand, may not provide a flat surface to press down on the tortilla, and the curved edges of the plate may make it difficult to flatten the tortilla evenly."}}

Add a heat or ice pack for extreme weather.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: It is important to research the laws and regulations regarding the shipment of live aquatic snails before attempting to ship them. Many gastropod species are classified as Plant Pests and are restricted from interstate travel in the US by USDA APHIS. Once the legal requirements have been met, the snails should be wrapped in a damp paper towel and placed in a ziplock baggie. The box should be insulated with styrofoam and packing peanuts, and a heat or ice pack should be added for mild weather. This method ensures that the snails are protected and have the best chance of surviving the shipping process. Option B is not a plausible answer as adding an ice pack for extreme weather could potentially harm the snails."}}
{"Q": "To make a bong out of a soda bottle,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) put the weed inside and heat up the entire bottle. (B) drill a hole into the bottom and insert a down stem.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) drill a hole into the bottom and insert a down stem.\nExplanation: Option (B) is a more plausible answer because it involves creating a proper airway for the smoke to travel through.

{"Q": "To keep edges of strapping from continuing to fray inconspicuously.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Burn the edges of the strapping to seal it off. (B) Paint the edges of the strapping to seal it off.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Burn the edges of the strapping to seal it off.\nExplanation: Burning the edges of the strapping will melt the fibers together, creating a seal that will prevent further fraying. Painting the edges may temporarily cover the frayed edges, but it will not prevent further fraying and may eventually peel off. Additionally, painting may add unnecessary weight and thickness to the strapping. Burning the edges is a common and effective method used in industries such as textiles and packaging."}}
{"Q": "how do you flush something?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) let it go down the sink drain with water running. (B) let it go down the toilet when you flush.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Let it go down the toilet when you flush.\nExplanation: Flushing refers to the act of disposing of waste or unwanted material by sending it down a drain or toilet using water. While option A may work for some things, it is not a reliable method for flushing as it may clog the sink drain. The more common and appropriate method of flushing is to use a toilet, which is designed to handle waste and has a larger drain pipe to prevent clogging."}}
{"Q": "How to quickly dry a towel?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Once the towel is washed, twist and strain it in the bathtub then dry in the dryer and hang outside afterward (B) Before the towel is washed, twist and strain it in the bathtub then dry in the dryer and hang outside afterward", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Once the towel is washed, twist and strain it in the bathtub then dry in the dryer and hang outside afterward.\n\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because the towel has already been washed and is wet, so twisting and straining it in the bathtub will help remove excess water and speed up the drying process. Drying it in the dryer will also help remove moisture quickly, and hanging it outside afterward will allow any remaining moisture to evaporate. Option B is not as practical because twisting and straining the towel before washing it may damage the fibers and reduce its absorbency."}}
{"Q": "To become more mindful during activities,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) meditate and concentrate on everything in the present moment. (B) keep your eyes closed for better focus and then try to relax and sleep.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. meditate and concentrate on everything in the present moment.\nExplanation: Mindfulness involves being fully present and aware of your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings in the present moment. Meditation is a powerful tool to cultivate mindfulness. By focusing on your breath or a specific object, you can train your mind to stay in the present moment and become more aware of your thoughts and emotions.

(B) Combine a tablespoon of coconut oil with one drop of lemon essential oil and one drop of lavender oil. Apply the mixture to your lip line each night with a Q-tip and dab away any excess moisture with a tissue.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Coconut oil is known to promote hair growth and moisturize the skin, while lemon essential oil and lavender oil have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that can help prevent infections and soothe irritation. Applying the mixture to the lash line specifically targets the area where lashes grow, making it more effective in promoting lash growth. Applying it to the lip line would not have the same effect on lash growth."}}
{"Q": "How to start a small flame without wood or a candle?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place a small bottle of hand sanitizer on a metal tray and set a match to it (B) Spray a small amount of hand sanitizer on a metal tray and set a match to it", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Spray a small amount of hand sanitizer on a metal tray and set a match to it.\nExplanation: Hand sanitizer contains alcohol which is flammable. By spraying a small amount of hand sanitizer on a metal tray and setting a match to it, the alcohol will ignite and create a small flame. However, it is important to use caution and not spray too much hand sanitizer as it can create a larger flame than intended.

The stove provides the necessary heat to melt the sugar and create a syrup. Freezing the mixture would not dissolve the sugar and would not result in a syrup."}}
{"Q": "To scramble eggs once cooking in a pan,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) using a spatula, scrape the egg up from the sides towards the middle of the pan, and flip the raw egg over like a pancake while the eggs are cooking in the frying pan. (B) using a spatula, gently scrape the egg from the sides towards the middle of the pan, allowing the uncooked egg to fill the empty space that has been scraped, continuing in a circle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer because it describes a gentle scraping motion that allows the uncooked egg to fill the empty space that has been scraped, creating a fluffy and evenly cooked scrambled egg. Option A, on the other hand, suggests flipping the raw egg over like a pancake, which may result in uneven cooking and potentially breaking the egg."}}
{"Q": "smoke", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can mark paper with color (B) can mark air with color", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Smoke particles can leave residue on surfaces, including paper, which can be seen as a discoloration or staining. However, smoke particles are not typically visible in the air as a distinct color. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "When making blueberry muffins or cupcakes, how do I keep the blueberries from turning the muffin or cupcake blue?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) When you add the blueberries, make sure that they are fully thawed. (B) When you add the blueberries, make sure that they are frozen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) When you add the blueberries, make sure that they are frozen.\n\nExplanation: When blueberries are frozen, they are less likely to burst and bleed their color into the batter. This will help to keep the muffins or cupcakes from turning blue. Additionally, frozen blueberries will also help to keep the batter from becoming too wet, which can also cause the color to bleed. Therefore, it is recommended to use frozen blueberries when making blueberry muffins or cupcakes."}}
{"Q": "How do I garnish kheer after it has cooked?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Garnish the kheer with some nuts and pots, and eat either hot or chilled (B) Garnish the kheer with some nuts and saffron stands, and eat either hot or chilled", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Garnish the kheer with some nuts and saffron stands, and eat either hot or chilled.\nExplanation: Garnishing kheer with nuts and saffron stands is a common practice in Indian cuisine.

{"Q": "how to make a pureed based tea", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Make a standard simple syrup. Brew your hot chooclate. Make your puree. Combine and serve (B) Make a standard simple syrup. Brew your tea. Make your puree. Combine and serve", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Make a standard simple syrup. Brew your tea. Make your puree. Combine and serve.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it follows the basic steps of making a pureed based tea. First, a standard simple syrup is made to add sweetness to the tea. Then, the tea is brewed separately. After that, the puree is made using fruits or vegetables of choice. Finally, the simple syrup, tea, and puree are combined and served. This method ensures that the tea is not overpowered by the puree and the flavors are balanced."}}
{"Q": "To tell when cabbage is done cooking, you should", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wait for the cabbage to become completely brown (B) Wait for the cabbage to become slightly translucent", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Wait for the cabbage to become slightly translucent.\nExplanation: Overcooking cabbage can result in a mushy texture and loss of nutrients. Therefore, it is best to cook cabbage until it is slightly translucent and tender but still retains some crunch. This usually takes around 5-7 minutes of cooking time. Waiting for the cabbage to become completely brown is not a good indicator of doneness as it can result in burnt and bitter cabbage."}}
{"Q": "shampoo", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cleans hair from dirt (B) cleans clothes from dirt", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Shampoo is a hair care product that is specifically designed to clean hair from dirt, oil, and other impurities. It contains ingredients that are gentle on the scalp and hair, and help to remove buildup and residue that can make hair look dull and lifeless. Shampoo is not designed to clean clothes, as it is formulated for use on hair only. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "serrated knife", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can cut glass  (B) can cut a can ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: While a serrated knife is designed to cut through tough materials, such as bread or meat, it is unlikely that it could cut through glass. Glass is a brittle material that requires a sharp, hard edge to cut through. On the other hand, a serrated knife could potentially cut through a can, especially if it has a sharp edge and the can is made of a thin material. However, it is important to note that cutting through metal cans can be dangerous and should only be attempted with caution."}}
{"Q": "How to clean sneaker soles", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use micellar water (B) Use a paintbrush dipped in bleach and mustard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Use micellar water.\nExplanation: Micellar water is a gentle and effective cleaning solution that can be used to clean sneaker soles. It is a mild cleanser that can remove dirt and grime without damaging the sole material. On the other hand, using a paintbrush dipped in bleach and mustard can be harmful to the sole material and may cause discoloration or damage. Therefore, using micellar water is a more plausible and safe option for cleaning sneaker soles."}}
{"Q": "Learn to quilt by hand.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gather some old cotton fabric. Either from knit clothes or curtains, old tablecloths etc. Look up a pattern you like and create templates out of wood. Cut this out and sew together. (B) Gather some old cotton fabric. Either from clothes or curtains, old tablecloths etc. Look up a pattern you like and create templates out of wood. Cut this out and sew together.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it is the same as option A, but it includes the word \"knit\" which is not suitable for quilting. Quilting requires woven fabric, not knit fabric. Additionally, creating templates out of wood is a common technique in quilting, and sewing the pieces together by hand is a traditional method that many quilters still use today."}}
{"Q": "Make a piano fountain.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Place piano next to pond and add plants to interior of piano. (B) Place piano next to pond and add plants to exterior of piano.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Place piano next to pond and add plants to exterior of piano.\nExplanation: Placing plants inside the piano would not only damage the instrument but also make it difficult to maintain the plants. On the other hand, adding plants to the exterior of the piano would create a unique and visually appealing fountain. The piano could be modified to allow water to flow through it, creating a waterfall effect, and the plants could be arranged around the piano to enhance the natural look. This option would also preserve the integrity of the piano as a musical instrument."}}
{"Q": "how do you test if pasta is fully cooked.?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) throw a piece of the pasta on the wall. if it sticks, it is ready. (B) throw a piece of pasta on the wall. if it doesn't stick, it isn't ready.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Throwing pasta on the wall is not a reliable or safe method to test if it is fully cooked. The best way to test if pasta is fully cooked is to taste it. Take a piece of pasta out of the pot and bite into it. If it is cooked through and has a tender texture, it is ready. If it is still hard or crunchy, it needs more time to cook. Another way to test is to cut a piece of pasta in half and check the center. If there is no white or uncooked part in the center, it is fully cooked."}}
{"Q": "How do we make the paper earrings dome shaped?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Once you have completed the dome earrings roll them into a ball using your hands. Then cover with glue. (B) Once you have completed the dome earrings push the paper downwards into the quill dome mold. Then seal the two sides of the dome using clear glue.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Once you have completed the dome earrings push the paper downwards into the quill dome mold. Then seal the two sides of the dome using clear glue.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it involves using a specific tool, the quill dome mold, to shape the paper into a dome shape. Rolling the earrings into a ball with your hands (option A) may not result in a consistent dome shape and may cause the paper to become misshapen. Pushing the paper into the mold will ensure a more uniform shape, and sealing the two sides with clear glue will keep the dome shape intact."}}
{"Q": "To ensure you put the caps on the keyboard back in the right places after dissembling them.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Take a picture of the intact keyboard. (B) Memorize the intact keyboard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Take a picture of the intact keyboard.\nExplanation: Taking a picture of the intact keyboard is a more plausible answer as it allows you to have a visual reference to refer to when reassembling the keyboard. Memorizing the keyboard layout can be difficult and prone to errors, especially if the keyboard has a complex layout or if you are not familiar with the keyboard. A picture, on the other hand, provides a clear and accurate representation of the keyboard layout, making it easier to put the caps back in the right places."}}
{"Q": "how do you do something quickly?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) go fast. (B) go slow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: To do something quickly, the most plausible answer is to go fast.

{"Q": "To clean a knitted blanket.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fill your bathtub with cold water (if the blanket is wool, warm if other material) and submerge the blanket. Put in a bit of detergent and swish it around, being careful to rub the fibers together. Drain the tub and refill it with cool water to rinse; repeat until there are no more suds. (B) Fill your bathtub with cold water (if the blanket is wool, warm if other material) and submerge the blanket. Put in a bit of detergent and swish it around, being careful not to rub the fibers together. Drain the tub and refill it with cool water to rinse; repeat until there are no more suds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because wool blankets require cold water to prevent shrinking, while other materials can handle warm water. Rubbing the fibers together can help remove dirt and stains, but it should be done carefully to avoid damaging the delicate knit. Rinsing with cool water helps remove any remaining detergent and ensures that the blanket is clean."}}
{"Q": "how do you recline?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sit back. (B) sit forward.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sit back.\nExplanation: To recline, one typically leans back or sits back in a chair or seat. Sitting forward would not result in reclining, as it would involve leaning forward instead of back."}}
{"Q": "How can I drain excess oil from fried foods?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Put on a plate on top of a paper towel. (B) Put on a plate under a paper towel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Put on a plate on top of a paper towel.\nExplanation: Placing the fried food on top of a paper towel will help absorb the excess oil. The paper towel will act as a blotter and soak up the oil, leaving the food less greasy. Placing the paper towel under the food will not be as effective in absorbing the excess oil."}}
{"Q": "How to chill trifle dessert", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cover in saran wrap and place in fridge for one hour. (B) Cover in paper towels and place in fridge for one hour.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Cover in saran wrap and place in fridge for one hour.\nExplanation: Saran wrap is a better option for covering the trifle dessert as it will prevent any air from getting in and keep the dessert fresh. Paper towels may absorb moisture from the dessert and make it dry. Placing the covered trifle in the fridge for an hour will allow it to chill and set properly before serving."}}
{"Q": "mop", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) has a blade  (B) has a long handle ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) has a long handle\nExplanation: A mop is a cleaning tool that is typically used to clean floors. It consists of a long handle and a mop head, which is made of absorbent material such as cotton or microfiber. The long handle allows the user to reach the floor without having to bend down, making it easier to clean large areas. While some mops may have a blade for scraping stubborn stains, this is not a common feature and is not necessary for basic cleaning tasks. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}

(B) use a big straw and rotate it around the container.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. use a big spoon and rotate it around the container.\nExplanation: Using a big spoon to stir liquid is a common and practical method. The spoon allows for a larger surface area to be covered and can easily mix the liquid thoroughly. A big straw may not be as effective as it may not be able to reach the bottom of the container and may not be able to mix the liquid as well."}}
{"Q": "How do you write with a pencil?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Take the pencil in your hand, and find a writing surface. Place the back end of the pencil onto the surface. Apply gentle pressure and move the pencil across the surface. (B) Take the pencil in your hand, and find a writing surface. Place the writing end of the pencil onto the surface.

Place the writing end of the pencil onto the surface. Apply gentle pressure and move the pencil across the surface.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the writing end of the pencil is the part that contains the graphite or lead, which is what actually makes the marks on the writing surface. Placing the back end of the pencil onto the surface would not produce any marks. Additionally, applying gentle pressure and moving the pencil across the surface is the correct technique for writing with a pencil."}}
{"Q": "Increase smoothness of hair.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Soak hair in brewed coffee before shower. (B) Soak hair in brewed tea before shower.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Soak hair in brewed tea before shower.\nExplanation: Tea contains antioxidants and tannins that can help to smooth and soften hair. The tannins in tea can also help to reduce frizz and add shine to hair. On the other hand, coffee can be too harsh for hair and may cause dryness and damage. Therefore, soaking hair in brewed tea before shower is a more plausible option to increase smoothness of hair."}}
{"Q": "How can I make a cool hanging shelf?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use 2 old belts, loop each and string one or 2 boards between the belts, nail the boards to the belts so they are even and horizontal.

Use 2 old belts, loop each and string one or 2 boards between the belts, nail the boards to the belts so they are even and horizontal.\n\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because hanging shelves are typically horizontal and it is easier to balance items on a horizontal surface. Using old belts adds a unique and creative touch to the shelf, and it is a sustainable way to repurpose old materials. Additionally, looping the belts creates a sturdy base for the shelf to hang from."}}
{"Q": "To decorate a lemon cake naturally,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) top it with blueberries. (B) top it with sprinkles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Top it with fresh lemon slices and/or edible flowers.\nExplanation: Decorating a lemon cake with fresh lemon slices is a natural and complementary choice that enhances the lemon flavor. Edible flowers, such as lavender or chamomile, can also add a pop of color and a delicate touch to the cake. Sprinkles, on the other hand, are not a natural choice and may clash with the lemon flavor. Blueberries could work, but they are not as visually striking as lemon slices or flowers."}}
{"Q": "How can I lose more weight?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Don't drink any water 4 hours before bedtime, it will help reduce calories. (B) Don't eat anything 4 hours before bedtime, it will help reduce calories.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Don't eat anything 4 hours before bedtime, it will help reduce calories.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is a common recommendation for weight loss. Eating close to bedtime can lead to weight gain because the body is less active during sleep and is more likely to store the calories as fat.

If you don't fancy holding it in place, tie it to a piece of string which ties onto a pencil. Remove after a few minutes. Shape the tip back again with your fingers.\n\nExplanation: Hot water will soften the wax in the crayon, making it easier to shape and sharpen. Cold water will not have the same effect. Tying the crayon to a pencil will help keep it in place while it is soaking in the hot water. Shaping the tip back with your fingers will give it a pointed end for coloring."}}
{"Q": "how do you prepare someone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) get them ready. (B) tell them what to do.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. get them ready.\nExplanation: To prepare someone means to make them ready for a particular task or situation. This involves not only telling them what to do but also providing them with the necessary resources, information, and support to perform the task successfully. Getting someone ready may involve training, coaching, mentoring, or providing them with the tools and equipment they need to do their job.

Additionally, the wire coat hanger provides a sturdy frame for the pantyhose to be stretched over, creating a durable and effective filtering net."}}
{"Q": "Make the best tasting lemonade you've ever tried.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Only use fresh lemons, a dozen for a 2 litre pitcher is perfect. Use only filtered water, no chlorine etc. Using a lemon squeezer or juicer, extract the fresh juice and pour into your 2 litre pitcher along with your favorite sweetener to taste, and fill with pure water. The water is what makes this lemonade taste so good. No after taste or chemical flavours to spoil it. (B) Lemonade can be made using vinegar and sugar, if you run out of lemons. With enough sugar you can't really taste the difference. It might need some yellow food colouring to make it look \"lemony\", which is quite important because the visual impact of food can rival the impact of the taste of the food itself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Using fresh lemons and filtered water ensures that the lemonade has a pure and natural taste without any chemical flavors or aftertaste. Adding your favorite sweetener to taste allows for customization and personal preference. This method prioritizes quality ingredients and natural flavors, resulting in the best tasting lemonade. Option B, while it may work in a pinch, relies on artificial coloring and lacks the fresh taste of real lemons."}}

I chop a 500mg tablet into quarters and add one of those to each processor load.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Adding a small amount of vitamin C to the homemade apple juice can help prevent it from turning brown due to oxidation. Chopping a 500mg tablet into quarters and adding all of them to each processor load ensures that enough vitamin C is added to the juice to prevent browning. Adding just one quarter of the tablet may not be enough to effectively prevent browning."}}
{"Q": "How do you steep tea?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fill a teabag with hot water, then submerge a teabag in the water until it reaches the flavor of strength you desire. (B) Fill a teacup with hot water, then submerge a teabag in the water until it reaches the flavor of strength you desire.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Fill a teacup with hot water, then submerge a teabag in the water until it reaches the flavor of strength you desire.\n\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer because it is the traditional way of steeping tea. The teabag is placed in a teacup filled with hot water and left to steep for a few minutes until the desired strength is achieved. This method allows the tea to infuse properly and release its full flavor. Using a teabag filled with hot water (option A) is not a common method of steeping tea and may not allow the tea to infuse properly."}}

{"Q": "How to swing a swinging ball?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Take the end with the ball and swing the rope around so that it is lighter and hence easier to swing. (B) Take the end of the rope without the ball and swing it so that the weight of the ball supports the movement.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Take the end of the rope without the ball and swing it so that the weight of the ball supports the movement.\n\nExplanation: This is the correct answer because when you swing a ball, the weight of the ball is what creates the momentum and keeps the swing going. By holding onto the end of the rope without the ball and swinging it, you are allowing the weight of the ball to support the movement and create a smooth swinging motion. If you were to swing the rope around with the ball, it would be harder to control and could potentially cause the ball to fly off in an unintended direction."}}
{"Q": "How to tell when chicken is cooked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Press the meat to feel if it is firm, if firm it is done, also look at the juices coming from the chicken, if they're clear it is done (B) Press the meat to feel if it is firm, if it shakes it is done, also look at the juices coming from the chicken, if they're pink it is done", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Press the meat to feel if it is firm, if firm it is done, also look at the juices coming from the chicken, if they're clear it is done.\n\nExplanation: When cooking chicken, it is important to ensure that it is cooked thoroughly to avoid any risk of foodborne illness. One way to tell if chicken is cooked is by pressing the meat to feel if it is firm. If it is firm, it is likely cooked through. Additionally, looking at the juices coming from the chicken can also be a good indicator of doneness. If the juices are clear, it is likely that the chicken is cooked through. If the juices are pink or red, it may need to be cooked for a bit longer. It is important to use a meat thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature of the chicken reaches at least 165°F (74°C) to ensure that it is safe to eat."}}

{"Q": "How can you bind PVC pipe together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put a bit of tape between two pieces and clamp together. (B) Put a bit of epoxy between two pieces and clamp together.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Put a bit of epoxy between two pieces and clamp together.\n\nExplanation: Epoxy is a strong adhesive that can bond PVC pipes together permanently. It is important to clean and dry the surfaces of the pipes before applying the epoxy. Once the epoxy is applied, the pipes should be clamped together until the adhesive sets. This method provides a secure and long-lasting bond between the PVC pipes. Using tape is not a reliable method for binding PVC pipes together as it may not provide a strong enough hold."}}
{"Q": "Make flat iron holder.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fold pot holder into a square. (B) Roll pot holder into a cylinder.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Roll pot holder into a cylinder.\nExplanation: Folding a pot holder into a square would not provide enough space to hold a flat iron.

{"Q": "How to thicken a soup quickly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) In the soup pan, mix equal parts butter and flour together until they cook out, about a couple of hours, then stir that mixture into the soup, the roux will thicken the soup (B) In a side pan, mix equal parts butter and flour together until they cook out, about a couple minutes, then stir that mixture into the soup, the roux will thicken the soup", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) In a side pan, mix equal parts butter and flour together until they cook out, about a couple minutes, then stir that mixture into the soup, the roux will thicken the soup.\n\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer because it is a quicker method to thicken soup. Making a roux (a mixture of flour and fat) is a common way to thicken soups and sauces. However, cooking the roux in a separate pan before adding it to the soup allows for better control over the consistency and prevents lumps from forming. Cooking the roux for a couple of minutes is sufficient to cook out the raw flour taste and activate the thickening properties of the flour. Adding the roux to the soup and stirring well will thicken the soup quickly and evenly."}}
{"Q": "how do you shield someone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) stand in front of them so that no harm comes their way. (B) stand behind them so that no harm comes your way.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: To shield someone means to protect them from harm or danger. Standing in front of them would physically block any potential harm from reaching them, while standing behind them would only protect yourself. Therefore, standing in front of them is the more plausible answer for shielding someone."}}
{"Q": "To prevent the bread bone dough from sticking to the cooking pan", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) use a silicone bedding sheet (B) use a silicone baking sheet", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. use a silicone baking sheet\nExplanation: Using a silicone baking sheet is a more plausible answer as it is specifically designed for baking and prevents sticking of dough or batter to the pan. A silicone bedding sheet may not be suitable for baking and may not provide the necessary non-stick properties required for bread or dough."}}

Cut your fine gauge wire into small pieces, roll out your black sugarpaste into sausages with balls on the end. Carefully stick your wire through the arms then use your spoon to cut the hands out.\nExplanation: Using a spoon to cut out the hands is a safer and more practical option than using a scalpel, especially for those who are not experienced with using sharp tools. Rolling out the sugarpaste into sausages with balls on the end will also give a more realistic look to Olaf's stick arms."}}
{"Q": "Knowing how much water to add to a homemade self watering system.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) About every week add roughly a gallon of water to a corner of the planter, as to not drown the plants. (B) About every week add roughly a ounce of water to a corner of the planter, as to not drown the plants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. About every week add roughly a gallon of water to a corner of the planter, as to not drown the plants.\n\nExplanation: A gallon of water per week is a reasonable amount for a self-watering system, as it allows for consistent moisture without over-saturating the soil. Adding only an ounce of water per week would likely not be enough to adequately hydrate the plants, and could lead to dryness and wilting. It's important to add the water to a corner of the planter, as this allows the water to distribute evenly throughout the soil and prevents any one area from becoming too waterlogged."}}
{"Q": "How can you prevent early waking when you have been drinking alcohol late?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eat a Loaf of bread with a jar of peanut butter, it will balance your blood sugar and you won't wake up as hungry as early.

Eat a piece of bread with peanut butter, it will balance your blood sugar and you won't wake up as hungry as early.\n\nExplanation: Alcohol consumption can cause a drop in blood sugar levels, which can lead to early waking due to hunger. Eating a piece of bread with peanut butter can help balance blood sugar levels and prevent early waking. However, eating a whole loaf of bread with a jar of peanut butter is excessive and may lead to discomfort or indigestion. Therefore, option B is a more plausible and reasonable solution."}}
{"Q": "How can I avoid cracking wood when adding screws?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Drill pilot holes after adding the screws. (B) Drill pilot holes before adding the screws.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Drill pilot holes before adding the screws.\n\nExplanation: When you drill pilot holes before adding screws, you create a small hole that allows the screw to go in smoothly without splitting the wood. This is especially important when working with hardwoods or thin pieces of wood. If you add screws without drilling pilot holes, the wood may crack or split, which can weaken the structure and make it less durable. Therefore, it is always better to drill pilot holes before adding screws to avoid cracking wood."}}
{"Q": "Hold hair pins near tub.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place pins on top of paper towel roll. (B) Place pins on top of toilet paper roll.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Place pins on top of paper towel roll.\nExplanation: Placing hair pins on top of a paper towel roll is a more plausible answer because it provides a stable surface for the pins to rest on and prevents them from falling into the tub. Additionally, paper towel rolls are often found in bathrooms and are easily accessible. Placing hair pins on top of a toilet paper roll is not a good idea as it is not stable and can easily tip over, causing the pins to fall into the tub or onto the floor."}}
{"Q": "To make Langos more Vegan friendly.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Langos' ingredients are Vegan friendly except for the olive oil. (B) Langos' ingredients are Vegan friendly except for the cheese and sour cream.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Langos' ingredients are Vegan friendly except for the cheese and sour cream.\nExplanation: Langos is traditionally made with flour, yeast, salt, and water, which are all vegan-friendly ingredients. However, the toppings usually include cheese and sour cream, which are not vegan. To make Langos more vegan-friendly, one can simply omit the cheese and sour cream toppings or replace them with vegan alternatives such as vegan cheese and vegan sour cream.

{"Q": "Prevent balloon from popping easily.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Add a layer of hairspray after blowing up. (B) Add a layer of hairspray before blowing up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Add a layer of hairspray before blowing up.\nExplanation: Adding a layer of hairspray before blowing up the balloon will create a barrier between the balloon and the air, making it less likely to pop easily. This is because the hairspray will make the surface of the balloon slightly sticky, which will help it to hold its shape and resist bursting. Adding hairspray after blowing up the balloon may not be as effective, as the air inside the balloon may already be putting pressure on the surface, making it more prone to popping."}}

Lasers can produce intense heat and energy, which can cause the air to ionize and create a plasma. This can lead to a phenomenon called laser-induced breakdown, where the laser energy is absorbed by the air and causes it to heat up and expand rapidly. This can create a visible plasma channel or spark, which can be used in various applications such as laser cutting, welding, and drilling. On the other hand, burning someone's face with a laser is unlikely as it would require a very specific and intentional action, and most lasers used in medical or cosmetic procedures are designed to be safe for human skin."}}

{"Q": "How to keep flour from going everywhere when using a mixer.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wrap the entire bowl in plastic wrap, and then turn on high to contain splatters. (B) cut a hole in the center of a paper plate, and use it as a splatter guard for the mixer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) cut a hole in the center of a paper plate, and use it as a splatter guard for the mixer.\n\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is a common and practical solution to prevent flour from going everywhere when using a mixer. By cutting a hole in the center of a paper plate and placing it over the bowl, it creates a barrier that catches any splatters and prevents them from spreading. This method is also easy to do and does not require any special equipment or materials. Wrapping the entire bowl in plastic wrap may not be effective in containing splatters and could potentially cause the plastic wrap to melt or tear."}}

{"Q": "Will rising prices correct a recession?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rising prices are a sign of inflation, but do not necessarily correlate with a correction in recession. The worst case scenario is a recession accompanied by rising cost of living due to inflation of prices and costs related to production and services. (B) Rising prices can signal a deflation, but do not necessarily cause a correction in recession. The worst case scenario of all would be rising prices and unemployment concurrently. Rising cost of living relates to rising costs of production and services.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Rising prices are a sign of inflation, but do not necessarily correlate with a correction in recession. The worst case scenario is a recession accompanied by rising cost of living due to inflation of prices and costs related to production and services.\n\nExplanation: While rising prices can sometimes signal a recovery from a recession, it is not a guarantee. In fact, rising prices can often be a sign of inflation, which can exacerbate the effects of a recession by increasing the cost of living and reducing purchasing power. Inflation can also lead to rising costs of production and services, which can further harm the economy. Therefore, it is important to address the underlying causes of a recession, such as a lack of demand or investment, rather than relying on rising prices to correct the situation."}}

Apply layer of vaseline on lips.\nExplanation: Applying a layer of vaseline on the lips can prevent the lipstick from smudging or transferring onto the teeth. This is because the vaseline acts as a barrier between the lips and teeth, preventing any transfer of product. Applying vaseline on the teeth is not a plausible solution as it can be uncomfortable and may not effectively prevent the transfer of lipstick."}}
{"Q": "Identify a one way mirror.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Place your finger on the mirror, if there is a gap between the reflection and your finger tip, it is a one way mirror. (B) Place your finger on the mirror, if there is no gap between the reflection and your finger tip, it is a one way mirror.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Place your finger on the mirror, if there is a gap between the reflection and your finger tip, it is a one way mirror.\n\nExplanation: A one way mirror, also known as a two-way mirror, is a type of mirror that allows light to pass through in one direction while reflecting light in the other direction. This means that one side of the mirror appears as a normal mirror, while the other side appears as a transparent window. To identify a one way mirror, you can place your finger on the mirror. If there is a gap between the reflection and your finger tip, it is a one way mirror. This is because the side with the gap is the side that allows light to pass through, while the other side reflects light."}}
{"Q": "To substitute for potatoes in a dish, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use broccoli because it looks and tastes similar to potatoes (B) Use cauliflower because it looks and tastes similar to potatoes", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Use cauliflower because it looks and tastes similar to potatoes.\nExplanation: Cauliflower is a more plausible substitute for potatoes because it has a similar texture and mild flavor. Broccoli, on the other hand, has a distinct flavor and texture that may not work well as a substitute for potatoes in certain dishes. Cauliflower can be mashed, roasted, or boiled just like potatoes, making it a versatile substitute. Additionally, cauliflower is lower in carbohydrates and calories than potatoes, making it a healthier option for those watching their diet."}}

{"Q": "To keep taco fillings from spilling out.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Line your taco shells with a napkin. Then when your shell breaks, the napkin will catch the rest of the fillings. (B) Line your taco shells with a lettuce leaf. Then when your shell breaks, the lettuce leaf will catch the rest of the fillings.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Line your taco shells with a lettuce leaf. Then when your shell breaks, the lettuce leaf will catch the rest of the fillings.\n\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because lettuce leaves are commonly used as a base for tacos and provide a natural barrier to keep the fillings from spilling out. Additionally, lettuce is edible and adds a fresh crunch to the taco, making it a practical and tasty solution. Using a napkin may not be as effective as it can easily tear or become soggy, and it is not meant to be eaten with the taco."}}
{"Q": "How can I make paper look older?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dip paper in some black tea. (B) Dip paper in some green tea.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Dip paper in some black tea.\n\nExplanation: Black tea contains tannins which can give paper an aged look. To achieve this, brew a strong cup of black tea and let it cool down. Then, dip the paper in the tea for a few minutes, making sure it is fully submerged. Remove the paper and let it dry completely.

The first collection should be before 10 a.m. Start by collecting those eggs with no chickens on them. Then carefully lift up those hens sitting in nests, quickly remove any eggs from the nest and put the hens back on their roosts. (B) Collect eggs at least once a day, especially in hot weather. The first collection should be before 10 a.m. Start by collecting those eggs with no chickens on them. Then carefully lift up those hens sitting in nests, quickly remove any eggs from the nest and put the hens back on their roosts.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Collecting eggs at least twice a day is recommended to ensure that the eggs are fresh and to prevent them from getting dirty or broken. The first collection should be before 10 a.m. as this is when most hens lay their eggs. It is important to start by collecting eggs with no chickens on them to avoid disturbing the hens and causing them to stop laying. When lifting up hens sitting in nests, it is important to do so carefully to avoid causing them stress or injury. Removing eggs quickly from the nest and putting the hens back on their roosts helps to minimize disruption to their daily routine."}}
{"Q": "To learn how to ride a bike.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Just get on the bike and start riding to learn how to do it consistently. (B) Start with training wheels to help will balance while moving then gradually take them off.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Start with training wheels to help with balance while moving then gradually take them off.\nExplanation: Starting with training wheels is a more plausible answer because it provides a gradual learning process. It allows the rider to get comfortable with the feeling of being on a bike and moving forward while still having the support of the training wheels. As the rider gains confidence and balance, the training wheels can be gradually raised or removed, allowing the rider to develop their balance and coordination. This method is commonly used for children learning to ride a bike, but can also be effective for adults who are new to cycling."}}
{"Q": "Save time at baggae claim.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wrap dark cloth around luggage handle. (B) Wrap bright cloth around luggage handle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Wrap bright cloth around luggage handle.\nExplanation: Wrapping a bright cloth around the luggage handle makes it easier to spot your luggage among the sea of similar-looking bags.

A dark cloth may blend in with other bags and make it harder to spot your luggage."}}
{"Q": "how to make more room in a closet", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) add an over the door rack for extra storage (B) add an over the washing machine rack for extra storage", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Add an over the door rack for extra storage.\nExplanation: Adding an over the door rack is a more plausible answer as it utilizes the unused space behind the closet door. This will not only create more storage space but also keep the items organized and easily accessible. On the other hand, adding an over the washing machine rack may not be practical for everyone as not all closets have a washing machine nearby."}}
{"Q": "To remove a zipper from a leather bag, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a pair of pliers to cut away the old zipper (B) Use a pair of scissors to cut away the old zipper", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Use a pair of scissors to cut away the old zipper.\nExplanation: Using pliers to cut away the old zipper may damage the leather material of the bag.

{"Q": "To check your breath in a short amount of time,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) lick your wrist with a dollop of spit and smell it ten seconds later. (B) spit onto a napkin and then smell the spit to gauge breath scent.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Licking your wrist with a dollop of spit and smelling it ten seconds later is a more plausible answer as it allows you to check your breath quickly without needing any additional materials. Spit onto a napkin may not accurately reflect the scent of your breath as it may mix with the scent of the napkin itself. Additionally, it may not be as convenient to carry around a napkin for this purpose. Licking your wrist is a common and easy method that can be done discreetly in public."}}
{"Q": "basket", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can enclose a safety pin  (B) can enclose a hula hoop ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible for a basket to enclose a safety pin than a hula hoop.

(B) Take a pencil eraser and work under your nails with it to get the junk out from under them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Take a pencil eraser and work under your nails with it to get the junk out from under them.\n\nExplanation: Using a pencil eraser is a more plausible answer as it is softer and less likely to cause damage to the nail bed or cuticles compared to using a pencil tip. The eraser can effectively remove debris without causing harm to the nail or surrounding skin. Additionally, it is important to clean the eraser before and after use to prevent the spread of bacteria."}}
{"Q": "Prevent water waste in toilet.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Flush after each use. (B) Flush only when defecating.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Flush only when defecating.\nExplanation: Flushing after each use, even when only urinating, can waste a significant amount of water.

Take one large banana and smash it in a dish, by hand or with a large spoon. Mix up the banana and oatmeal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Option B is more plausible as it only requires one ingredient, a banana, to be mashed and mixed with microwaveable oatmeal. Option A includes the unnecessary step of smashing a coconut and papaya in a concrete block, which is not only difficult but also not relevant to the recipe. Additionally, the recipe only calls for a banana and oatmeal, not coconut or papaya."}}
{"Q": "to make a portable bidet for a bed ridden person inexpensively", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) fill warm water in an empty water bottle and squeeze gently as needed (B) fill warm water in an empty dishwashing liquid bottle and squeeze gently as needed", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Filling warm water in an empty water bottle and squeezing it gently as needed is a more plausible answer as it is easier to find an empty water bottle than an empty dishwashing liquid bottle. Additionally, water bottles are designed to hold water and are more hygienic than dishwashing liquid bottles. This method is also cost-effective and can be easily disposed of after use."}}
{"Q": "To become frightened of a movie again after seeing it before,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) look up reviews for the movie to better understand it. (B) wait a few years before watching it a second time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Wait a few years before watching it a second time.\nExplanation: Waiting a few years before watching the movie again can help create distance from the initial viewing experience and allow for a fresh perspective. This can help to rekindle the fear factor and make the movie feel new again. Looking up reviews may provide some insight into the movie, but it is unlikely to change the fear response to the movie."}}
{"Q": "To open up bolts.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a spanner and revolve the spanner over the bolt until the bolt is opened. (B) Use adjustable spanner by putting it over the bolt and turning the bolt anti-clockwise.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Use adjustable spanner by putting it over the bolt and turning the bolt anti-clockwise.\nExplanation: Using an adjustable spanner is a more plausible answer as it is specifically designed for turning bolts and can be adjusted to fit different sizes of bolts. Revolving a regular spanner over the bolt may not provide enough grip or torque to open the bolt. Additionally, turning the bolt anti-clockwise is the correct direction for loosening bolts."}}
{"Q": "What is a good alternative to sandpaper when removing varnish from wood?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A wood filer would remove varnish safely. (B) A liquid solvent would remove varnish safely.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. A liquid solvent would remove varnish safely.\n\nExplanation: Using a liquid solvent, such as paint stripper, is a more effective and efficient alternative to sandpaper when removing varnish from wood. Sandpaper can be time-consuming and may damage the wood if not used properly. A liquid solvent, on the other hand, can dissolve the varnish and make it easier to scrape off with a putty knife or scraper. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when using a liquid solvent."}}
{"Q": "how do you exchange an item?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) take the item and reciept back to the original store, and get another item to keep in its place. (B) take the item back to the original store, and switch it for something else you want to keep.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer because it involves returning the item with the receipt to the original store and getting another item to keep in its place. This is a common practice for exchanging items and ensures that the store can verify the purchase and provide a replacement item of equal value. Option B, on the other hand, suggests simply switching the item for something else without any verification or exchange process, which is unlikely to be accepted by most stores."}}
{"Q": "Cure a headache with a drink.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Brew some ginger tea. (B) Brew some kool-aid.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Brew some ginger tea.\nExplanation: Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation in the blood vessels in the head, which can cause headaches. Additionally, ginger can help alleviate nausea, which is a common symptom of headaches. Kool-aid, on the other hand, is a sugary drink that is unlikely to have any medicinal properties to help with a headache. Therefore, brewing some ginger tea is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Protect wooden surface from moisture.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Apply vinegar and water to the surface with a soft brush or sponge brush. Let dry completely. (B) Apply clear poly coat to the surface with a soft brush or sponge brush. Let dry completely.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Apply clear poly coat to the surface with a soft brush or sponge brush. Let dry completely.\n\nExplanation: Applying a clear poly coat creates a protective layer on the wooden surface, preventing moisture from seeping in and causing damage. Vinegar and water may help clean the surface, but it does not provide a protective layer. Additionally, vinegar is acidic and may damage the wood if used excessively. Therefore, applying a clear poly coat is a more plausible solution to protect wooden surfaces from moisture."}}
{"Q": "How long do I bake the semolina-coconut mixture when making a basbousa?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bake the mixture in a preheated washer for 35 to 45 minutes (B) Bake the mixture in a preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Bake the mixture in a preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes.\n\nExplanation: Basbousa is a Middle Eastern dessert made with semolina and coconut. To bake it, the mixture is usually placed in a baking dish and then baked in a preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until it turns golden brown on top. Baking it in a washer is not a common method and may not produce the desired results. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How can I keep buttons from falling off my clothes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Paint a bit of clear nail polish remover over the threads that go over the top of the buttons. (B) Paint a bit of clear nail polish over the threads that go over the top of the buttons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Paint a bit of clear nail polish over the threads that go over the top of the buttons.\n\nExplanation: Painting a bit of clear nail polish over the threads that go over the top of the buttons creates a protective layer that helps to keep the threads from unraveling and the buttons from falling off. Clear nail polish is a quick and easy solution that can be done at home without any special tools or skills. On the other hand, using clear nail polish remover may weaken the threads and cause them to break, which could make the buttons fall off even more easily."}}
{"Q": "clamp", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can be used like a  marker  (B) can hold a marker marker ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) can hold a marker.\nExplanation: A clamp is a device used to hold objects tightly together to prevent movement or separation. It is commonly used in woodworking, metalworking, and other manufacturing processes. While a clamp could potentially be used as a marker, it is not a common or practical use for the tool. On the other hand, a clamp can easily hold a marker in place, making it a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How should I open jump rings when making earrings?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Pull the wire of the jump ring as far apart as possible to make the gap size that you need. This method keeps the jump rings structurally sound and is essential for closing them in their proper shape. (B) Twist the wire of the jump ring slightly to the side. Twist just enough to make the gap size that you need. This method keeps the jump rings structurally sound and is essential for closing them in their proper shape.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Twisting the wire of the jump ring slightly to the side is a more plausible answer because it creates a gap without pulling the wire apart, which can weaken the jump ring and make it more difficult to close properly. Twisting just enough to make the gap size needed will keep the jump ring structurally sound and ensure that it can be closed in its proper shape."}}
{"Q": "How can I clean my tennis shoes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Apply toothpaste to an old toothbrush and then work the paste into the dirty soles of the shoes then leave the toothpaste on the shoes for about ten minutes, and then wipe it off with a damp towel. Repeat the process if necessary. (B) Apply toothpaste to an old toothbrush and then work the paste into the dirty spots then leave the toothpaste on the shoes for about ten minutes, and then wipe it off with a damp towel. Repeat the process if necessary.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Applying toothpaste to an old toothbrush and working the paste into the dirty soles of the shoes is a more plausible answer as the soles of tennis shoes tend to accumulate more dirt and grime than the upper part of the shoe. Leaving the toothpaste on the shoes for about ten minutes and wiping it off with a damp towel helps to remove the dirt and stains effectively. However, if there are any dirty spots on the upper part of the shoe, one can use a different cleaning method or repeat the process with a new toothbrush."}}
{"Q": "how to make pasta", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) place flour on a clean nonporous surface and create a well in the middle, add egg yolks and mix them together then roll it out thick as you can get it and cut it into strips. (B) place flour on a clean nonporous surface and create a well in the middle, add egg yolks and mix them together then roll it out as thin as you can get it and cut it into strips.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: When making pasta, it is important to roll it out as thin as possible to achieve the desired texture and consistency. Rolling it out thick will result in a heavier, doughier pasta that may not cook evenly. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer as it instructs to roll the pasta out as thin as possible before cutting it into strips."}}

It is not large enough to act as a patch on a real person's bed. However, it could be used as a small comforter or blanket on a real person's bed, making option (B) a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "how do you call the fuzz", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) dial 911 (B) dial fuzz under contacts.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Dial fuzz under contacts.\nExplanation: \"The fuzz\" is a slang term for the police. While dialing 911 may connect you to emergency services, it may not necessarily connect you to the police department. Dialing \"fuzz\" under contacts would be a more direct and specific way to contact the police. However, it is important to note that using slang terms when communicating with emergency services may cause confusion and delay in response time. It is always best to use clear and concise language when reporting an emergency."}}

{"Q": "To anneal a metal file, you can", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Heat it with a blowtorch until the file loses its magnetism (B) Heat it with a toaster until the file loses its magnetism", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Heat it with a blowtorch until the file loses its magnetism.\n\nExplanation: Annealing is a process of heating a metal to a specific temperature and then cooling it slowly to make it softer and more malleable. To anneal a metal file, it needs to be heated to a high temperature, which cannot be achieved with a toaster. A blowtorch can provide the necessary heat to anneal the metal file. The magnetism of the file is used as an indicator of the temperature, as it loses its magnetism when it reaches the annealing temperature. Therefore, heating the file with a blowtorch until it loses its magnetism is a more plausible answer."}}

{"Q": "drone", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can be a spy recorder when a flash is attached (B) can be a spy recorder when a camera is attached", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Drones are commonly used for aerial photography and videography, and attaching a camera to a drone is a common practice. While it is possible to attach a flash to a drone, it would not be very practical for spying purposes as it would likely draw attention to the drone and the person controlling it. On the other hand, attaching a camera to a drone would allow for discreet recording from a distance, making it a more plausible option for spying."}}
{"Q": "To safely sleep with your baby in your bed,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) lay under a light cover only, keep yourself between them and the other parent and put pillows on the ground by the bed in case the baby falls off. (B) lay on top of the cover, keep yourself between them and the other parent or preferably have the other parent sleep somewhere else, and put up a barrier to keep the baby from falling onto the floor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Option A is a safer choice as it recommends laying under a light cover only, which reduces the risk of suffocation. Keeping yourself between the baby and the other parent also reduces the risk of accidental suffocation or overlaying. Placing pillows on the ground by the bed in case the baby falls off provides a safety net in case of accidental falls. Option B, on the other hand, suggests laying on top of the cover, which increases the risk of suffocation. While putting up a barrier to keep the baby from falling onto the floor is a good idea, it is not a foolproof solution, and it is still safer to have the baby sleep in a separate crib or bassinet."}}
{"Q": "Where should I plant lily bulbs for the best results?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The lily bulbs should be planted in continuously-moist soil in an area that gets minimal sun. (B) The lily bulbs should be planted in well-draining soil in an area that gets a lot of sun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The lily bulbs should be planted in well-draining soil in an area that gets a lot of sun.\nExplanation: Lily bulbs require well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging, which can cause the bulbs to rot. Additionally, lilies need a lot of sunlight to grow and bloom properly. Planting them in an area that gets minimal sun will result in weak and spindly plants that may not produce flowers. Therefore, planting lily bulbs in well-draining soil in an area that gets a lot of sun is the best option for optimal growth and blooming."}}
{"Q": "How to Keep the Breading from Falling Off Chicken", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After your chicken is breaded, chill for ten minutes. (B) Dip the chicken in hot sauce and then fry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) After your chicken is breaded, chill for ten minutes.\nExplanation: Chilling the breaded chicken for ten minutes before frying allows the breading to adhere better to the chicken. This is because the cold temperature helps the breading to set and stick to the chicken. On the other hand, dipping the chicken in hot sauce before frying may cause the breading to become soggy and fall off. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "To carefully cut a slot into a piece of wood, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a metal file (B) Use a table saw", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Use a table saw.\nExplanation: Using a metal file to cut a slot into a piece of wood would be a tedious and time-consuming process. A table saw, on the other hand, is designed for making precise cuts in wood and would be a much more efficient and effective tool for this task. Additionally, a table saw can be adjusted to make cuts of varying depths and widths, allowing for greater flexibility in the size and shape of the slot being cut."}}
{"Q": "Shovel", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cleans up rocks if spilled (B) cleans up blood if spilled", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) cleans up rocks if spilled\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a shovel would be used to clean up rocks if spilled, as it is a common tool for landscaping and construction work. Cleaning up blood with a shovel is not a common or appropriate use for the tool."}}

It chills the whiskey without diluting it too much, unlike an ice sheet which can melt quickly and water down the drink. Additionally, using an ice cube is more convenient and easier to handle than an ice sheet."}}
{"Q": "A good way to cut a wooden panel in half.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) When a plane wooden panel in half, it is best to first make sure it is smooth and there are no branches in the wood. (B) To cut a wooden panel in half, it is best you check for staples to prevent damaging the cutting tool.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. When a plane wooden panel in half, it is best to first make sure it is smooth and there are no branches in the wood.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it focuses on the preparation of the wooden panel before cutting it in half. It is important to ensure that the panel is smooth and free of any obstructions that could damage the cutting tool or cause the cut to be uneven. Checking for branches in the wood is also important as they can cause the wood to split or crack during the cutting process. This answer shows a good understanding of the importance of preparation in achieving a clean and accurate cut."}}
{"Q": "How to clean grime on a stove top?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mix together baking soda and water, turn the plate off and scrub with steel wool and the mixture then let sit for an hour before washing off (B) Mix together baking soda and water, turn the plate on and scrub with steel wool and the mixture then let sit for a day before washing off", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mix together baking soda and water, turn the plate off and scrub with steel wool and the mixture then let sit for an hour before washing off.\n\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because turning the plate off ensures that it is cool enough to handle and prevents any accidents. Scrubbing with steel wool and the mixture helps to remove the grime without damaging the stove top. Letting it sit for an hour allows the mixture to penetrate the grime and make it easier to clean off. Option B is not recommended as turning the plate on can be dangerous and may cause the mixture to dry out and become harder to clean off. Letting it sit for a day is also unnecessary and may cause further damage to the stove top."}}
{"Q": "How do you boil sweet potatoes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Boil until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Note, it will take less time if you cut the sweet potatoes in smaller pieces. (B) Boil until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Note, it will take less time if you mix the sweet potatoes in smaller pieces.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Boil until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Note, it will take less time if you cut the sweet potatoes in smaller pieces.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because cutting the sweet potatoes into smaller pieces will increase the surface area, allowing them to cook faster. Mixing the sweet potatoes in smaller pieces, as suggested in option B, does not make sense as it is unclear what is being mixed and how it would affect the cooking time. Additionally, the suggested cooking time of 15 to 20 minutes is a common guideline for boiling sweet potatoes until they are tender."}}
{"Q": "What is the main purpose of a minimalist wallet?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Minimalist wallets are used to mainly carry credit/debit cards and less money. (B) Minimalist wallets are used to only carry currency notes so that there isn't the added weight of coins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: The main purpose of a minimalist wallet is to carry only the essentials, such as credit/debit cards and a small amount of cash, while minimizing bulk and weight. This allows for easier and more comfortable carrying, especially in pockets or small bags. While some minimalist wallets may not have a designated coin pocket, they are not solely designed for carrying currency notes and can still accommodate coins if needed."}}
{"Q": "Prevent rust ring from metal shaving cream can.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Coat the bottom of the can with clear nail polish. (B) Coat the top of the can with clear nail polish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Coat the bottom of the can with clear nail polish.\nExplanation: Rust forms when metal is exposed to moisture and oxygen. By coating the bottom of the can with clear nail polish, it creates a barrier between the metal and any moisture that may be present on surfaces where the can is placed. Coating the top of the can may not be as effective as it does not protect the bottom where the can is in direct contact with surfaces."}}

It is unlikely that a can of spray paint would only be able to mark up a thin sheet of paper with graffiti, as the paint is designed to adhere to a variety of surfaces. However, it is plausible that a can of spray paint could be used to mark up a previously nice building with graffiti, as this is a common form of vandalism."}}

{"Q": "Carve words into wooden boards.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Take a piece of paper and write the word you want to carve on it. Hold the paper over a board and use a knife to trace along your word, carving it into the wood. (B) Take a piece of pipe and write the word you want to carve on it. Hold the pipe over a board and use a knife to trace along your word, carving it deeper into the pipe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Take a piece of paper and write the word you want to carve on it. Hold the paper over a board and use a knife to trace along your word, carving it into the wood.\n\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it involves using a paper template to guide the carving process. This ensures that the letters are evenly spaced and the word is spelled correctly. Using a pipe to carve the word is not practical as it would be difficult to hold the pipe steady and control the depth of the carving. Additionally, carving into a pipe would not result in a flat surface, making it difficult to read the word."}}
{"Q": "ornament", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can decorate tree  (B) can decorate desk  ", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Ornaments are traditionally used to decorate Christmas trees, making option A the more plausible choice.

(B) cut off the white that is around the yolk and eat the yolk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. just eat the egg itself.\nExplanation: Boiled eggs are typically eaten whole, with the shell removed. The yolk and white are both consumed together, as they provide a balanced mix of protein, fat, and other nutrients. Cutting off the white around the yolk would result in a loss of some of these nutrients, and is not a common way to eat boiled eggs."}}
{"Q": "Cut a piece of screen to cover a car window", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place the screen on the window and trace around, cutting one to two inches smaller than the edge of the window, then ccut (B) Place the screen on the window and trace around, leaving one to two inches around the edge, then cut", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Place the screen on the window and trace around, cutting one to two inches smaller than the edge of the window, then cut.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because cutting the screen one to two inches smaller than the edge of the window will ensure that the screen fits snugly and securely on the window. Leaving one to two inches around the edge, as suggested in option B, may result in the screen being too loose and not providing adequate coverage."}}

Remove any debris from the meshes with a clean, dry, soft-bristled brush.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Using a stiff-bristled brush is more effective in removing debris from the meshes compared to a soft-bristled brush. A soft-bristled brush may not be able to remove stubborn debris that may have accumulated on the meshes. However, it is important to use a dry brush to avoid any moisture from getting into the AirPods."}}
{"Q": "Remove dents from carpet.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Let ice cream melt on dent, then pat dry. (B) Let ice cube melt on dent, then pat dry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Let ice cube melt on dent, then pat dry.\nExplanation: This method works because the ice cube will cause the carpet fibers to expand and regain their original shape. As the ice melts, the water will help to fluff up the fibers. Once the ice has melted, use a clean cloth to blot up any excess water and then use a spoon or the edge of a credit card to gently lift the fibers back up. This method is more plausible than using ice cream, which could leave a sticky residue on the carpet."}}

(B) move it forward and upward slightly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. move it forward and downward slightly.\nExplanation: Tipping a hat is a gesture of respect or greeting. To do it, you should move the hat forward and downward slightly, as if you were acknowledging the person in front of you. Moving it upward would not be a natural movement and could be interpreted as a different gesture. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How do you light a match?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) quickly run the black end over the matchbox to ignite it. (B) dip it onto asphalt for 2 seconds and it should ignite.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: To light a match, you need to strike the black end of the match against the rough surface on the side of the matchbox.

Find old newspaper or tissue paper from Christmas. Cut them with scissors until you have a full bucket of tiny paper pieces.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because newspaper and tissue paper are commonly used for papier mache pulp. Cardboard boxes are not typically used for papier mache pulp as they are too thick and difficult to cut into small pieces. Additionally, it is important to cut the paper into small pieces to ensure that it blends well with the glue and water mixture."}}
{"Q": "How many legs do you need for a coffee table.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) You need five legs (B) You need four legs", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.

(B) Scour yard sales and pick up an old shoe and use it for all of your condiments like, mustard, ketchup, mayo, bbq sauce, dips and whatever you need in a small quantity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Scour yard sales and pick up an old muffin tin and use it for all of your condiments like, mustard, ketchup, mayo, bbq sauce, dips and whatever you need in a small quantity.\n\nExplanation: Using an old muffin tin is a more plausible option as it is designed to hold small quantities of food items and has separate compartments for each condiment. It is also easy to clean and can be reused for future BBQs. Using an old shoe for condiments is unhygienic and impractical as it is not designed for holding food items and may not have separate compartments for each condiment."}}
{"Q": "How can I easily carry clothes on hangers when I move?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Take a couple of full heavy duty clothes hangers, then hook several hangers of clothes on Those hangers and carry them all at once. (B) Take a couple of empty heavy duty clothes hangers, then hook several hangers of clothes on Those hangers and carry them all at once.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Taking a couple of full heavy duty clothes hangers and hooking several hangers of clothes on them is a more plausible answer because it allows you to carry multiple items at once without having to take up too much space or make multiple trips. Additionally, the weight of the clothes on the hangers will help keep them in place and prevent them from sliding off during transport. Taking empty hangers would require more trips and may result in the clothes sliding off the hangers."}}

Bring the milk and cream to a simmer on a low - medium heat. Once the mixture begins to simmer, remove from the heat and add the chocolate and caramel sauce.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because adding the chocolate and caramel sauce to the hot milk and cream while it is still on the heat can cause the chocolate to burn and the caramel to separate. By removing the mixture from the heat before adding the chocolate and caramel sauce, it allows the ingredients to melt and combine evenly without the risk of burning or separating."}}
