{"Q": "The child brought psycho-physical phenomena on a new life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The woman gave birth to a child. (B) The baby feels the awareness through physical sensations.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The baby feels the awareness through physical sensations.\nExplanation: Psycho-physical phenomena refer to the interaction between the mind and body. In this case, the baby is experiencing these phenomena because they are becoming aware of their surroundings through physical sensations such as touch, taste, smell, sight, and sound. This is a natural part of the development process as the baby learns to navigate and interact with the world around them. The act of giving birth alone does not cause psycho-physical phenomena, but rather it is the baby's sensory experiences that lead to this phenomenon."}}
{"Q": "Otters enter their new habitat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Otters start looking for abalone for food. (B) They always live by the water so that they can drink water easily.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Otters start looking for abalone for food.\nExplanation: Otters are known to be carnivorous and their diet mainly consists of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks like abalone. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would start looking for abalone for food in their new habitat rather than just living by the water for easy access to drinking water."}}
{"Q": "Lila can find what she wants quickly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lila bought several kinds of textbooks. (B) Lila loves classification of her things.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Lila's love for classification of her things is a more plausible cause for her ability to find what she wants quickly. If she has a system in place for organizing her belongings, it would be easier for her to locate them when needed. Buying several kinds of textbooks may not necessarily contribute to her ability to find what she wants quickly, unless she has a system for organizing them as well."}}
{"Q": "The chance she gets flu becomes smaller. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fish has suffered from the infection. (B) She has been vaccined.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that she has been vaccinated. Vaccination is a preventive measure against flu, and it reduces the chance of getting infected. On the other hand, the fact that the fish has suffered from the infection does not necessarily affect the woman's chance of getting flu."}}
{"Q": "He got some rum. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The worker fremented some sugar cane with yeast. (B) Tom went out and want to hunt some cottontails.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The worker fermented some sugar cane with yeast.\nExplanation: Rum is typically made by fermenting sugar cane with yeast, so it is more plausible that the cause of him getting rum was due to someone fermenting sugar cane with yeast rather than Tom going out to hunt cottontails."}}
{"Q": "Grande opened the drawers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The red blood flew out. (B) He saw his old clothing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He saw his old clothing.\nExplanation: Since the sentence only mentions Grande opening the drawers, it is more plausible that he simply saw his old clothing inside rather than blood flying out. The latter option would require additional context or information to make sense."}}
{"Q": "He will not withstand the dry climate there. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack's farm experienced a drought this year. (B) He wants to travel the Sahara desert.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jack's farm experienced a drought this year.\nExplanation: The statement mentions a \"dry climate,\" which suggests a lack of rainfall or water. Option A states that Jack's farm experienced a drought, which would result in a dry climate. Option B, on the other hand, mentions traveling through the Sahara desert, which is known for its dry climate, but it does not provide any context for why the person in question would not be able to withstand it. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Black's sweat always drips into his eyes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Black pulled out his eyelashes for beauty. (B) Black doesn't like sleeping.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Black pulled out his eyelashes for beauty, as this can cause sweat to drip into the eyes. On the other hand, not liking sleeping does not have a direct correlation with sweat dripping into the eyes."}}
{"Q": "Racing drivers will encounter common dangers from time to time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Smoking will inhale nicotine. (B) There are many obstacles on the track.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There are many obstacles on the track.\nExplanation: Racing drivers face a variety of dangers on the track, including obstacles such as debris, other cars, and track conditions. These obstacles can cause accidents and injuries, making it important for drivers to stay alert and focused while racing. While smoking may have negative health effects for drivers, it is not a direct cause of the dangers they face on the track."}}
{"Q": "The bar asks a businessman for help. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a serious financial crisis in Australia. (B) The bar wants to devise some tests.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There was a serious financial crisis in Australia.\nExplanation: The bar asking a businessman for help suggests that they are facing financial difficulties and need assistance in managing their finances. Option B, which suggests that the bar wants to devise some tests, is not a plausible answer as it does not make sense in the context of the given information."}}
{"Q": "Lily has taken some sulfonamedes to make hemolysis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The medicine didn't work. (B) Lily has been killed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The medicine didn't work.\nExplanation: Sulfonamides are antibiotics that work by inhibiting the growth of bacteria. They do not cause hemolysis, which is the destruction of red blood cells. Therefore, if Lily took sulfonamides to cause hemolysis, the medicine would not work for that purpose. However, it is important to note that taking sulfonamides for reasons other than prescribed by a doctor can be dangerous and potentially harmful to one's health."}}
{"Q": "It cannot produce oxygen. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's experiment produced some methanol gas. (B) No energy is available for the dying plant anymore.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that no energy is available for the dying plant anymore. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis, which requires energy from sunlight. If a plant is dying, it may not have enough energy to continue producing oxygen. Option A, which suggests that Tom's experiment produced some methanol gas, is not directly related to the plant's ability to produce oxygen."}}
{"Q": "Tom has good eyesight. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom found the poisonous snake in time. (B) Tom pays great attention to eye protection.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Since Tom has good eyesight, he was able to spot the poisonous snake in time, which could have otherwise caused harm to him or others. It is more plausible than option B, which talks about eye protection, but does not necessarily follow from the fact that Tom has good eyesight."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to know more about production. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bought a soda. (B) Tom set out to go to the dense regions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom set out to go to the dense regions.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom would seek out information on production by going to areas where production is concentrated, rather than buying a soda which has no direct relation to production. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "He observed tracks on the ground where the jaguar had moved its all tour legs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The neighbor gave Tom a saguaro. (B) The zoologist made an observation of the jaguar's habits.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The zoologist made an observation of the jaguar's habits.\nExplanation: The observation of tracks on the ground where the jaguar had moved its all four legs suggests that the jaguar was moving around in that area. This observation is more likely to be a result of a zoologist's observation of the jaguar's habits rather than a neighbor giving Tom a saguaro, which is unrelated to the jaguar's movement."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has established a community to help those homeless children. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many of her friends join in the warm-hearted family. (B) It needs a lot of people to explore it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Many of her friends join in the warm-hearted family.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Lucy's friends would be inspired by her efforts and want to join in to help the homeless children. Creating a community to help those in need is a noble cause and can attract like-minded individuals who want to make a positive impact. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that the community requires a lot of people to explore it, which doesn't make sense in the context of helping homeless children."}}
{"Q": "Scientists avoid great impact of atoms. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The abuse of nuclear power is terrifying. (B) He was studying atoms.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The abuse of nuclear power is terrifying because it can lead to catastrophic consequences such as nuclear explosions, radiation poisoning, and environmental damage. Therefore, scientists take great precautions to avoid any potential impact of atoms and ensure the safe use of nuclear technology."}}
{"Q": "As he walked, he felt much heavier than before. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mr. Howard was going to hiking who had a big bag on his back. (B) Jack had stomach cramps.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mr. Howard was going hiking who had a big bag on his back.\nExplanation: Carrying a heavy bag while walking can make a person feel heavier than usual. This is because the weight of the bag adds to the person's own weight, making it more difficult to move around. On the other hand, stomach cramps would not necessarily make a person feel heavier, but rather uncomfortable or in pain. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He obserevd the growth of the embryo inside the seed at first. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He observed the process from germination of seeds to eventually maturation of plants. (B) Jack nurtures a newborn jackdaw.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The observation of the growth of the embryo inside the seed suggests that the focus was on the early stages of plant development, specifically from the point of seed germination. Option B, which refers to the nurturing of a jackdaw, is not relevant to the given statement."}}
{"Q": "After the financial crisis, the suicide rate increased significantly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The financial crisis left many people homeless. (B) Time goes on.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The financial crisis left many people homeless.\nExplanation: The financial crisis resulted in many people losing their jobs and homes, leading to increased stress and financial strain. Studies have shown that homelessness is a significant risk factor for suicide, as individuals may feel hopeless and isolated. Therefore, it is plausible that the increase in suicide rates was due to the financial crisis leaving many people homeless."}}
{"Q": "They often exchange their own privileges. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The two competitors became friends of reciprocity. (B) Audrey and her friends take part in group trips.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the exchange of privileges is a result of the two competitors becoming friends of reciprocity, meaning they have a mutual understanding to exchange favors or privileges. Option B does not provide a clear explanation for the cause of the exchange of privileges."}}
{"Q": "Mary read some papers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She made many mistakes because of her frets. (B) She knew lots of details.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She knew lots of details.\nExplanation: Since Mary read some papers, it is likely that she gained knowledge and information from them. Therefore, it is more plausible that she knew lots of details rather than making many mistakes due to her frets."}}
{"Q": "Sam wished to eat stew for supper. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He never eats junk food. (B) Sam's wife went to buy some meat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Since Sam wished to eat stew for supper, it is more plausible that his wife went to buy some meat to make the stew. Option A, which states that he never eats junk food, is not relevant to the situation and does not provide a logical explanation for what happened as a result of Sam's wish to eat stew."}}
{"Q": "It's half way through autumn. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It has difficulty in running. (B) It rains more in half autumn than in spring and summer combined.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It rains more in half autumn than in spring and summer combined.\nExplanation: Autumn is typically associated with cooler temperatures and increased precipitation. As the season progresses, the amount of rainfall tends to increase, leading to more rainy days and potentially even flooding in some areas. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of being halfway through autumn would be increased rainfall, rather than any difficulty in running."}}
{"Q": "The major planets interact. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is gravity among the planets. (B) There is magnetic force among the planets.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There is gravity among the planets.\nExplanation: The major planets in our solar system interact with each other through the force of gravity. This gravitational force is what keeps the planets in their orbits around the sun and also causes them to influence each other's orbits. For example, the gravitational pull of Jupiter affects the orbits of other planets, such as Saturn and Uranus. The magnetic force, on the other hand, is not a significant factor in the interactions between the major planets."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a civet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The civet sleeps a lot. (B) The civet eats the fish quickly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The civet sleeps a lot.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that having a new owner or environment would cause the civet to feel stressed or anxious, leading to increased sleep as a coping mechanism. Eating habits may also be affected, but there is no clear reason to assume the civet would eat fish specifically or eat quickly."}}
{"Q": "Alice likes the smell of milk. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She always eats cakes with a lot of cream. (B) She made some perfume.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alice would choose to eat cakes with a lot of cream, as it is a common way to enjoy the smell of milk in a food context. Making perfume would require more effort and resources, and may not be a natural response to simply liking the smell of milk."}}
{"Q": "Jack wanted to know why Quasars drown out the light from all the other stars in the same galaxy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He took use of stoichimetry. (B) He looked it up and found out that it was because they were so bright.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Jack most likely researched the topic and found out that Quasars are extremely bright and emit a large amount of energy, which can drown out the light from other stars in the same galaxy. Stoichiometry, which is a branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of quantities of substances involved in chemical reactions, would not be relevant in this context. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Simon's mother often let Simon eat soys. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Simon grows healthy. (B) Simon is often sick.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Simon grows healthy.\nExplanation: Soy is a good source of protein and other nutrients, such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Consuming soy regularly can help improve overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Therefore, it is more plausible that Simon grows healthy as a result of eating soy, rather than being often sick."}}
{"Q": "A factory produces several tons of tissues from straws. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are physically stronger. (B) The quality of these tissues is different.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The quality of these tissues is different.\nExplanation: It is unlikely that the tissues would become physically stronger just because they are made from straws. However, using a different material to make the tissues may affect their quality, such as their softness, absorbency, or durability. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack added nitrites into the water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The catfish died earlier than the scalefish in the water. (B) The scalefish died earlier than the catfish in the water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The scalefish died earlier than the catfish in the water.\n\nExplanation: Nitrites are toxic to fish and can cause a condition called nitrite poisoning. This can lead to respiratory distress, lethargy, and even death in fish. Scalefish are more sensitive to nitrites than catfish, so they are more likely to die earlier when exposed to high levels of nitrites in the water. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His action led to the movement of the wheels. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The machine was set in motion. (B) The second step followed it soon after.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The machine was set in motion.\nExplanation: Since the action led to the movement of the wheels, it is likely that the machine was set in motion as a result. Option B, \"The second step followed it soon after,\" does not seem as plausible as it does not directly relate to the movement of the wheels."}}
{"Q": "Jack's interest is to study human species. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He decides to choose anthropology as his major in college. (B) Jack's company mainly uses nanotechnology.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Since Jack's interest is to study human species, anthropology would be the most relevant field of study for him. Anthropology is the study of human societies, cultures, and their development. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack would choose anthropology as his major in college to pursue his interest in studying human species. Option B, which mentions Jack's company using nanotechnology, is not related to his interest in studying human species and seems less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Father of our religion combined a union of opposite tenets. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It accepted diverse cultures. (B) His action of syncretism was praised.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It accepted diverse cultures.\nExplanation: The father of our religion, most likely referring to the founder of a major world religion, combined a union of opposite tenets, which means he brought together opposing beliefs or ideas. This could have resulted in a more inclusive and accepting religion that welcomes diverse cultures and beliefs. Syncretism, the blending of different religious or cultural beliefs, is not always praised and can be controversial. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Various features show that this is a dicot in the family Piperaceae. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This seed is a monocot rather than dicot. (B) Researchers suspected it is a peperomia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Researchers suspected it is a peperomia.\n\nExplanation: The statement suggests that various features of the seed indicate that it belongs to the family Piperaceae, which is a family of dicots. Therefore, it is unlikely that the seed is a monocot (option A). Instead, the most plausible answer is that researchers suspected it is a peperomia, which is a genus within the family Piperaceae. Peperomia plants are known for their small, succulent leaves and are commonly grown as houseplants."}}
{"Q": "Tom has measured the magnetism of the material. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The result reached nearly four feet. (B) It is 15 gammas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It is 15 gammas.\n\nExplanation: The sentence only mentions that Tom measured the magnetism of the material, but it does not provide any information about the measurement result reaching nearly four feet. Therefore, option (A) is not a plausible answer. On the other hand, the sentence states that \"Tom has measured the magnetism of the material,\" which implies that he obtained a measurement value. The only measurement value provided in the choices is 15 gammas, so option (B) is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom studied the types of polypropylene. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found that they came in five types. (B) He found that they came in two types.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He found that they came in five types.\nExplanation: Polypropylene is a thermoplastic polymer that can be produced in different types based on its molecular structure and properties. It is more likely that Tom found that there are five types of polypropylene rather than just two, as there are several factors that can affect the classification of polypropylene types, such as the method of production, the presence of additives, and the intended use. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The source of the mud was investigated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was reported that the soil source was very rich. (B) It was reported that the soil source was very dry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was reported that the soil source was very rich.\nExplanation: If the source of the mud was investigated, it is more likely that the investigators would report on the quality of the soil rather than its dryness. Additionally, the use of the word \"rich\" suggests that the soil was nutrient-dense and could potentially contribute to the formation of mud. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The student feel anxious to take the exam. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They choose to watch porn online. (B) Her teacher gave her a warm smile.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Her teacher gave her a warm smile.\nExplanation: When feeling anxious, receiving support and encouragement can help alleviate some of the stress. In this case, the student's teacher giving her a warm smile could have helped her feel more confident and less anxious about taking the exam. Choosing to watch porn online is not a plausible answer as it is not a typical coping mechanism for exam anxiety and is not related to the situation."}}
{"Q": "This charity donates money to Asian areas with famine. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Some people western india were hungry. (B) Some people western india were helped.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Some people in western India were helped.\nExplanation: Since the charity donates money to Asian areas with famine, it is likely that the money was used to provide aid and assistance to those who were suffering from hunger and malnutrition in the affected areas. Therefore, it is more plausible that some people in western India were helped rather than becoming hungry as a result of the charity's actions."}}
{"Q": "The state has launched a policy of collusion. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The government is aware of the importance of children's health for the future of the country and wants to reduce child mortality. (B) The state began to crack down on competitive economic activities in an all-round way.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The government is aware of the importance of children's health for the future of the country and wants to reduce child mortality.\n\nExplanation: The policy of collusion is likely to involve cooperation between different government agencies and departments to achieve a common goal. In this case, the goal is to reduce child mortality, which is a pressing issue in many developing countries. By collaborating and sharing resources, the government can implement more effective measures to improve children's health, such as providing vaccinations, improving access to healthcare, and promoting healthy lifestyles. This is a more plausible answer than B, which suggests that the state is cracking down on economic activities, which is unlikely to be related to a policy of collusion."}}
{"Q": "Tom improved his learning efficiency today. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Now he is proficient in giving a presentation. (B) He finished all his homework ahead of schedule.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If Tom improved his learning efficiency, it means he is able to learn and understand things more quickly and effectively. This would likely result in him being able to finish his homework ahead of schedule, as he would be able to complete it more efficiently. Becoming proficient in giving a presentation may also be a result of improved learning efficiency, but it is not necessarily the most immediate or likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "Tom cut the rind of the watermelon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to take pictures with the watermelon. (B) Tom wants to eat watermelon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Tom cutting the rind of the watermelon is more likely to be because he wants to eat the watermelon. The rind is not typically eaten and needs to be removed before consuming the fruit inside. While it is possible that Tom may want to take pictures with the watermelon, it is less likely to be the cause of him cutting the rind."}}
{"Q": "Tom has observed charge movement. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom give the circuit voltage. (B) Tom has bought a mayfly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom give the circuit voltage.\nExplanation: Charge movement is a result of the presence of an electric field, which can be created by applying a voltage to a circuit. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom observed charge movement because he gave the circuit voltage, rather than buying a mayfly, which has no relation to electric charge movement."}}
{"Q": "This child caught roseola. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He succeeded via conjuring up a flower. (B) The child had a fever which followed by a rash.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The child had a fever which followed by a rash.\nExplanation: Roseola is a viral illness that commonly affects young children. It typically starts with a high fever for several days, followed by a rash that appears once the fever breaks. The rash usually starts on the trunk and spreads to the limbs and face. Conjuring up a flower has no relation to the symptoms of roseola. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This phenomenon is called speciation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists say that many species have become extinct since ancient times. (B) A species gradually adapted to its environment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. A species gradually adapted to its environment.\nExplanation: Speciation occurs when a population of a species gradually adapts to its environment over time, leading to the development of new traits and characteristics that eventually result in the formation of a new species. This process can occur through natural selection, genetic drift, or other mechanisms that cause genetic variation and divergence within a population. While extinction can also contribute to changes in biodiversity, it is not the direct cause of speciation."}}
{"Q": "He found out that cytokines worked in it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was studying how body temperature rises. (B) The scientist testing lipoproteins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The scientist testing lipoproteins.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that cytokines worked in \"it,\" which implies that there was a specific experiment or study being conducted. Option B mentions a scientist testing lipoproteins, which could be a possible experiment where cytokines were discovered to have an effect. Option A, on the other hand, is unrelated to cytokines and body temperature, so it is less likely to be the cause of the discovery."}}
{"Q": "Now it's time to remove the drugs from the patient's body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor uses the method of plasmapheresis to treat him. (B) Various elimination processes was adopted to achieve that.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Various elimination processes were adopted to achieve that.\nExplanation: Plasmapheresis is a method of removing plasma from the blood and replacing it with other fluids. It is typically used to treat certain autoimmune disorders and not for removing drugs from the body. Therefore, it is more plausible that various elimination processes such as metabolism, excretion through urine and feces, and possibly dialysis were used to remove the drugs from the patient's body."}}
{"Q": "He successfully solved the problem. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He cannot solve the problem from start to finish. (B) He has a clear understanding of this problem.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He has a clear understanding of this problem.\n\nExplanation: If someone successfully solves a problem, it means that they have found a solution to it. This indicates that they have a clear understanding of the problem and have been able to apply their knowledge and skills to solve it. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) is not a logical consequence of successfully solving a problem."}}
{"Q": "The villagers were happy about the harvest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They responded with a public press. (B) They had enough food this year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They had enough food this year.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the villagers had enough food this year as a result of a good harvest. A public press is not a common response to a good harvest and is not directly related to having enough food."}}
{"Q": "The lecturer is talking about t lymphocytes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I can hear blindness sometimes. (B) I can hear t-cells sometimes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I can hear t-cells sometimes.\nExplanation: The lecturer is specifically talking about t lymphocytes, which are also known as t-cells. Therefore, it is more plausible that the listener would hear \"t-cells\" rather than \"blindness.\""}}
{"Q": "He found the pyridine disappeared. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor traced the sources of this toxin. (B) The scientist put some pyridine in the water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor traced the sources of this toxin.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the pyridine disappeared unexpectedly, which implies that it was not intentionally removed by someone. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the disappearance was due to a natural or accidental occurrence, such as the doctor discovering that the pyridine was a toxin and tracing its sources to eliminate it. On the other hand, option B suggests that the scientist intentionally put pyridine in the water, which does not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Amy served as an assistant in this company. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy is good at services work. (B) She is hired by a potent company for her potential to make interest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Amy is good at services work.\nExplanation: The sentence only states that Amy served as an assistant in the company, but it does not provide any information about her being hired by another company. Therefore, option B is not a plausible answer. However, the sentence implies that Amy has experience in services work, which suggests that she may have developed skills and knowledge in this area. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Human might get infected owing to sick mosquitoes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Harmful bacteria can make people sick. (B) Virus attacked the mosquitoes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Harmful bacteria can make people sick.\n\nExplanation: Mosquitoes can carry and transmit various types of bacteria, such as those that cause diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus. When a mosquito bites a person, it can transfer these bacteria into the person's bloodstream, potentially causing illness. While viruses can also be transmitted by mosquitoes, bacterial infections are a more common cause of mosquito-borne illnesses. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It is difficult for him to get mind equilibrium now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Henry always runs into hindrances in doing business. (B) He suffers from epilepsy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Henry is having difficulty achieving \"mind equilibrium,\" which suggests that he is experiencing some level of stress or anxiety. Option A provides a more plausible explanation for this, as running into hindrances in business can be a significant source of stress and frustration. Option B, while a valid medical condition, does not necessarily explain why Henry is struggling with his mental state in this particular context."}}
{"Q": "The school will hold a ceremony the day after tomorrow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The school will hold a simulation in advance tomorrow. (B) The school takes no behaviors.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The school takes no behaviors.\nExplanation: If the school is holding a ceremony the day after tomorrow, there is no need for them to hold a simulation in advance tomorrow. Therefore, option (A) is not a plausible answer. Option (B) is more likely as it suggests that the school is simply waiting for the day of the ceremony without taking any additional actions."}}
{"Q": "Tom has taken use of two pieces of magnets to make his experiment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are dextrorotary and levorotary. (B) He has proved something about the attraction.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He has proved something about the attraction.\nExplanation: The question does not provide enough information to determine whether the magnets are dextrorotary or levorotary. However, the fact that Tom used two magnets in an experiment suggests that he was testing the attraction between them. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of the experiment was related to the attraction between the magnets rather than their optical rotation."}}
{"Q": "Tom takes use of a thermostat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The small chicken shoud be incubated under the same temperature. (B) Tom always catches a cold.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The use of a thermostat is commonly associated with maintaining a consistent temperature for incubating eggs or other small animals. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom is using the thermostat to ensure that the chicken is incubated under the same temperature rather than using it to prevent catching a cold."}}
{"Q": "She cannot have contact with dough. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy has constipation. (B) She is allergic to yeast.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She is allergic to yeast.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lucy cannot have contact with dough because she is allergic to yeast. Yeast is a common ingredient in dough, and people with yeast allergies can experience symptoms such as hives, itching, and difficulty breathing when they come into contact with it. Constipation is not typically a symptom of a yeast allergy."}}
{"Q": "The workers have no idea about how to operate the computer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their teacher told them the answer was limestone. (B) The leader taught them in person.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The leader taught them in person.\nExplanation: Since the workers have no idea about how to operate the computer, it is likely that they would need someone to teach them in person. Option A, where the teacher tells them the answer to a question unrelated to computer operation, does not make sense in this context. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The patient with fibroadenomas read his report of mammography. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was in relief for its benign appearance. (B) They collect many fibres.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was in relief for its benign appearance.\nExplanation: Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors that are usually detected through mammography. When the patient reads the report and finds out that the tumor is benign, they are likely to feel relieved and reassured that they do not have breast cancer. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B, which suggests that the fibroadenomas collect many fibers, is not relevant to the diagnosis or the patient's reaction to the report."}}
{"Q": "The children will be shipped off to a boarding school. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their parents taught their children how to solve living problems independently before going to school. (B) Various elimination processes was adopted to achieve that.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Their parents taught their children how to solve living problems independently before going to school.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is a common practice for parents to prepare their children for boarding school by teaching them life skills and problem-solving techniques. This helps the children to adjust better to the new environment and become more independent. Option B, on the other hand, is not a likely outcome as it suggests a harsh and possibly unethical approach to preparing children for boarding school."}}
{"Q": "He went to school. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He learned a lot. (B) He was good at social interaction.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He learned a lot.\nExplanation: Going to school is primarily for the purpose of gaining knowledge and education. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of going to school is learning a lot rather than being good at social interaction. While social interaction may be a secondary benefit of attending school, it is not the main purpose."}}
{"Q": "The workers are in charge of cleaning debris. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They have to consider the waste. (B) Tom brings a clean dry rag and start cleaning the dirty floor .", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They have to consider the waste.\nExplanation: Since the workers are in charge of cleaning debris, it is likely that they will have to consider the type of waste they are cleaning up. They may need to sort the debris into different categories, such as recyclable materials, hazardous waste, or general trash. This is important for proper disposal and to ensure that the waste is handled in an environmentally responsible manner. On the other hand, option B is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the given statement and introduces a new character, Tom, who is not mentioned in the original sentence."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said that his heart rhythm is uneven. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack's infusion speed was uneven. (B) He asked the cardiologist to watch the condition of the heart.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jack's infusion speed was uneven.\nExplanation: Uneven infusion speed can cause fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate, leading to an irregular heart rhythm. This can be a side effect of certain medications or a result of improper administration of IV fluids. It is important to monitor infusion rates carefully to avoid such complications. Option B is not a plausible answer as asking a cardiologist to monitor the heart condition does not directly cause an uneven heart rhythm."}}
{"Q": "Enzymes are necessary for children's growth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Then kids can grow taller. (B) Children are encouraged to eat sprouts.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Then kids can grow taller.\nExplanation: Enzymes are essential for the breakdown and absorption of nutrients in the body, which are necessary for growth and development. Without enzymes, children may not be able to properly digest and utilize the nutrients from their food, which can lead to stunted growth. Therefore, if children have sufficient enzymes, they are more likely to grow taller. Eating sprouts may provide some enzymes, but it is not the only source, and there are many other factors that contribute to children's growth."}}
{"Q": "Parliament is a place of justice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My father really wants individual liberty and individual responsibility. (B) The house of the people holds justice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Parliament is the legislative body of a country, composed of elected representatives who are responsible for making laws and overseeing the government. As such, it is often seen as a symbol of justice and democracy, representing the will of the people and ensuring that their rights and interests are protected. While individual liberty and responsibility are important values, they are not directly related to the role of Parliament as a place of justice."}}
{"Q": "The man devoted himself to journalism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He mastered the popular language used in pursuit of truth. (B) He became fatter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He mastered the popular language used in pursuit of truth.\nExplanation: Devoting oneself to journalism would likely involve a lot of reading, writing, and interviewing, which would improve one's language skills. Additionally, journalists often need to communicate complex ideas in a clear and concise manner, which would require a mastery of language. Becoming fatter is not a logical result of devoting oneself to journalism."}}
{"Q": "He said he got a ladybug. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom went to the zoo. (B) Tom found a small dome-shaped beetle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Tom found a ladybug, which is a type of beetle. Option B states that Tom found a small dome-shaped beetle, which is a more plausible explanation for how he got the ladybug. Option A, which mentions Tom going to the zoo, is not relevant to the statement and does not provide any explanation for how Tom got the ladybug."}}
{"Q": "The primates didn't want to be exhibit animals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They escaped from the zoo. (B) They ran to the dianosaurs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They escaped from the zoo.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the primates would try to escape from the zoo rather than run to the dinosaurs, as dinosaurs are extinct and not present in modern zoos. It is also common for animals to try to escape from captivity if they feel uncomfortable or stressed in their environment. Therefore, it is more likely that the primates would try to escape rather than seek out non-existent dinosaurs."}}
{"Q": "The root of the plant rotted. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) In order to save the plant, Tom gave it a rhizoid. (B) The plants were beginning to wilt.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The plants were beginning to wilt.\nExplanation: If the root of a plant rots, it means that the plant is no longer able to absorb water and nutrients from the soil. As a result, the plant will start to show signs of stress, such as wilting or yellowing leaves. Giving the plant a rhizoid (which is a type of root-like structure) would not necessarily save it, as the plant may already be too damaged. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was a shepherd. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He took care of a flock of sheep. (B) I respected his extensive observations.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He took care of a flock of sheep.\nExplanation: Since Tom was a shepherd, it can be inferred that his job was to take care of a flock of sheep. Shepherds are responsible for the well-being of their sheep, including feeding, watering, and protecting them from predators. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B does not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Tom feels that his asthma is about to attack. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was injected with some water. (B) He eats some singulars.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: None of the given choices are plausible.\n\nExplanation: Neither being injected with water nor eating \"singulars\" (assuming this means some kind of medication) would be effective or appropriate responses to an impending asthma attack. Tom should use his prescribed inhaler or seek medical attention immediately."}}
{"Q": "But the students can't understand the example. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher gives an example to illustrate the grammar point. (B) Researchers are debating.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The cause of the students not understanding the example is that the teacher gave an example to illustrate the grammar point, but it was not clear or effective enough for the students to comprehend. This could be due to the teacher's explanation, the complexity of the example, or the students' level of understanding."}}
{"Q": "The scientist observed its appearance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nobody has seen edaphosauruses before. (B) A scientist has picked up a paramecium and curious about it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Nobody has seen edaphosauruses before.\nExplanation: The observation of the appearance of edaphosauruses suggests that they were previously unknown or unseen by scientists. This is a more plausible explanation than option B, which mentions a paramecium, a single-celled organism that is unrelated to edaphosauruses."}}
{"Q": "All relatives entered the family room. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their ages ranged from 20 to 50 years old. (B) They sat on the chairs one by one.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They sat on the chairs one by one.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the action of entering the family room. When people enter a room, it is common for them to find a place to sit. The age range of the relatives is not necessarily relevant to the action of entering the room."}}
{"Q": "There are many people, among which part of them are with normal sight and part of them are blind. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their disability can be rated by following a continuum. (B) Normal people can see everything and blind people are in a dark world without any light.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Their disability can be rated by following a continuum.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that there are people with normal sight and people who are blind, indicating a range of visual abilities. Therefore, it is more plausible to say that their disability can be rated by following a continuum, rather than assuming that normal people can see everything and blind people are in complete darkness. The continuum can include various levels of visual impairment, from mild to severe, and can be used to determine the extent of the disability and the appropriate accommodations needed."}}
{"Q": "The wine must be kept from becoming flabby. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The alcohol worked. (B) Acidity should be used.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Acidity should be used.\nExplanation: Flabbiness in wine refers to a lack of acidity, which can make the wine taste dull and lifeless. To prevent this, winemakers often use techniques such as adding tartaric acid or malic acid to the wine to increase its acidity. This helps to balance out the flavors and keep the wine tasting fresh and vibrant. While alcohol can also play a role in the overall balance of a wine, it is not typically used specifically to combat flabbiness."}}
{"Q": "Tom ran into an anemone. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Spontaneous ignition occurred. (B) He was poisoned.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was poisoned.\nExplanation: Anemones are known to have stinging cells called nematocysts that can release toxins when triggered. If Tom ran into an anemone, it is likely that he was stung and experienced some level of poisoning. Spontaneous ignition is not a plausible result of running into an anemone."}}
{"Q": "The company loses one million due to rust after a few months. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The company keeps the steel in a wet warehouse. (B) Qualcomm Company has applied for many patents.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Rust is caused by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of moisture. Therefore, keeping steel in a wet warehouse would increase the likelihood of rust formation and ultimately lead to financial losses for the company. On the other hand, Qualcomm Company applying for patents has no direct correlation with the rust formation and financial loss of the company."}}
{"Q": "Mary ate lots of chocolate. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She also intook theobromine. (B) She eats more nutritious food than before.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She also intook theobromine.\nExplanation: Chocolate contains theobromine, a stimulant that can affect the central nervous system and cause various physiological effects. Consuming large amounts of chocolate can lead to theobromine toxicity, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, tremors, and seizures. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mary also ingested theobromine as a result of eating lots of chocolate. Option B is less likely because consuming lots of chocolate does not necessarily mean that Mary started eating more nutritious food than before."}}
{"Q": "Farmers do not use softwoods as firewoods. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tracheilds are not suitable to be used as fire materials. (B) Tom went into the farm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tracheids are not suitable to be used as fire materials.\nExplanation: Softwoods, such as pine and spruce, have a high content of tracheids, which are elongated cells that transport water and nutrients in the tree. Tracheids are not as dense as hardwoods, such as oak and maple, and therefore do not burn as hot or as long. Additionally, softwoods tend to produce more creosote when burned, which can build up in chimneys and cause fires. For these reasons, farmers typically do not use softwoods as firewood. The option B, \"Tom went into the farm,\" is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the question and does not provide any explanation for why farmers do not use softwoods as firewood."}}
{"Q": "The field was very quiet at night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Suddenly it began to rain. (B) The silence was broken by several bird calls.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The silence was broken by several bird calls.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the quietness of the field at night would be interrupted by natural sounds such as bird calls rather than sudden rain. Additionally, birds are known to be more active during the early morning and evening hours, making it more likely that they would be heard during the night."}}
{"Q": "It died. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The possum has eaten an ill bird. (B) The fish has suffered from the infection.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The fish has suffered from the infection.\nExplanation: While it is possible for a possum to eat an ill bird, it is less likely to be the cause of death for the subject in question. On the other hand, fish are known to be susceptible to infections that can lead to their death. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He served as an accountant in this company. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got a copy of the contract. (B) He worked hard to manage the balance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He worked hard to manage the balance.\nExplanation: As an accountant, his primary responsibility would be to manage the financial records and ensure that the balance sheet is accurate. Therefore, it is more plausible that he worked hard to manage the balance rather than getting a copy of the contract, which may not be directly related to his job as an accountant."}}
{"Q": "Lyle's doctor treated him with a laser. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lyle has ophthalmologist. (B) Logan got bone cancer and his osteocytes lost the function of secreting enzymes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The use of a laser in medical treatment is commonly associated with ophthalmology, which is the branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of eye disorders. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lyle's doctor treated him with a laser because he has an eye condition that requires such treatment. Option B is not related to the use of a laser in medical treatment and is therefore less likely to be the cause of Lyle's treatment."}}
{"Q": "This experiment requires a gray-white solid with a shiny surface. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It is not worth seeing grays. (B) The teacher provided tellurium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The teacher provided tellurium.\nExplanation: The requirement for a gray-white solid with a shiny surface suggests that the experiment requires a specific substance with those properties. Since the teacher provided tellurium, it is likely that this substance meets the requirements and was chosen for the experiment. Option A is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any explanation for what happened in the experiment."}}
{"Q": "Their new baby born yesterday. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This new life starts to cry. (B) He is likely to see cottonmouths around.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This new life starts to cry.\nExplanation: It is common for newborn babies to cry after they are born. This is a natural response to being in a new environment and experiencing the stress of birth. Therefore, it is more plausible that the new baby would start to cry rather than seeing cottonmouths around."}}
{"Q": "Compression sound waves were produced. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom plucked the strings and the friction between the strings and the air produced vibrations. (B) The vocal folds vibrated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Compression sound waves are typically produced by the vibration of vocal folds in the larynx. As air is forced through the vibrating folds, it creates a series of compressions and rarefactions in the air, which we perceive as sound. Option A is incorrect because it describes the production of sound by a plucked string instrument, which would produce transverse waves rather than compression waves."}}
{"Q": "He has been dizzy lately. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Brants had a terrible headache when he was on the field. (B) Jack's hemoglobin levels are low.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Dizziness can be a symptom of anemia, which is often caused by low hemoglobin levels. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack's dizziness is caused by his low hemoglobin levels rather than Brants' headache."}}
{"Q": "Jerry was baptized. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The public saw baptism. (B) He was identified by the believers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was identified by the believers.\nExplanation: Baptism is a symbolic act of publicly declaring one's faith in Jesus Christ. When Jerry was baptized, he publicly declared his faith and was identified as a believer by other believers. This is a common practice in many Christian communities, where baptism is seen as an important step in one's spiritual journey. While the public may have seen the baptism, the more significant result is that Jerry was identified as a believer by other believers."}}
{"Q": "Emma, who is a regular coffee drinker, is very hyper these days. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She often deals with their delirium. (B) The doctor diagnosed him as caffeinism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The doctor diagnosed her as caffeinism.\nExplanation: Caffeinism is a condition that occurs due to excessive consumption of caffeine, which can lead to symptoms such as restlessness, anxiety, and hyperactivity. As Emma is a regular coffee drinker and is currently experiencing hyperactivity, it is possible that she has developed caffeinism. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A is not a likely outcome as delirium is a severe symptom that is not commonly associated with caffeinism."}}
{"Q": "He defecates on time every day. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom eats some health products containing enzymes every day. (B) My pig took in high fiber feed ingredients.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the pig's diet contains high fiber feed ingredients, which can promote regular bowel movements. Enzymes in health products may aid in digestion, but they are unlikely to have such a consistent effect on defecation timing."}}
{"Q": "The angry patient was injected depressants. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He felt angry and scrared. (B) He felt calm and relaxed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He felt calm and relaxed.\nExplanation: Depressants are drugs that slow down the central nervous system, resulting in a calming and relaxing effect. Therefore, it is more plausible that the angry patient would feel calm and relaxed after being injected with depressants."}}
{"Q": "The victims were taken to the police office to identify the crimnimal. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They tried to recall the face of the criminal. (B) They found the body as a female college student.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They tried to recall the face of the criminal.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the victims were taken to the police office to identify the criminal, rather than finding a body of a female college student. Once at the police office, the victims would have been shown a lineup or photographs of potential suspects to try and recall the face of the criminal who committed the crime against them."}}
{"Q": "She has made a glass of smoothy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice wants to feel the moisture. (B) Lucy has bought a llot of fresh fruit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Lucy has bought a lot of fresh fruit, as smoothies are typically made with fresh fruit. It is unlikely that Alice wants to feel the moisture as a reason for making a smoothie."}}
{"Q": "He just took the pills. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wants to sleep very much now. (B) He asked the doctor to gave him some depressants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He wants to sleep very much now.\nExplanation: Since the sentence mentions that he \"just took the pills,\" it is more likely that he is experiencing the immediate effects of the medication. Many medications, especially those for pain or anxiety, can cause drowsiness as a side effect. Therefore, it is more plausible that he wants to sleep rather than asking for more medication."}}
{"Q": "I've been picking fish bones for a long time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My mother stewed a mahimachi for me at noon. (B) The piranha was hungry and found a dead fish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the person picked fish bones because they ate a fish dish, as opposed to encountering a piranha in their daily life. The mention of a specific fish, mahimachi, also suggests that the person had a meal with fish bones."}}
{"Q": "They are botanists. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) When scientists took photos today, they found that the protein structure on the surface of rotavirus has changed. (B) They collect specimens everyday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They collect specimens everyday.\nExplanation: Being botanists, their expertise lies in the study of plants. Therefore, it is more plausible that they collect specimens every day as part of their research work rather than having any direct impact on the protein structure of rotavirus."}}
{"Q": "He caught a bluegill. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John craves for baby bluebirds. (B) The old man wants to catch some sunfish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The old man wants to catch some sunfish.\nExplanation: The mention of catching a bluegill, which is a type of sunfish, suggests that the old man's intention was to catch sunfish. Choice (A) about John craving baby bluebirds is unrelated and unlikely to be the cause of catching a bluegill."}}
{"Q": "This mobile phone is not durable. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The battery often fails to charge. (B) It can be repelled by an inducing corn field.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The battery often fails to charge.\nExplanation: If a mobile phone is not durable, it is likely to have issues with its components, including the battery. A battery that often fails to charge is a common problem with phones that are not durable. On the other hand, being repelled by an inducing corn field is not a plausible result of a phone's lack of durability."}}
{"Q": "He failed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was finding the fly in his house at night. (B) The patients was in the process of the treatment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The patients was in the process of the treatment.\nExplanation: The given options do not provide enough context to determine the exact situation in which the person failed. However, option B seems more plausible as it suggests that the failure could be related to the treatment process. Option A, on the other hand, seems unrelated and does not provide any logical explanation for the failure."}}
{"Q": "The baby ground squirrels were hidden by their mom. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were not found by the rattlesnakes. (B) Visitors find it hard to distinguished them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They were not found by the rattlesnakes.\nExplanation: Baby ground squirrels are often preyed upon by rattlesnakes. By hiding them, the mother squirrel is protecting her young from potential danger. Therefore, it is more plausible that the hiding resulted in the babies not being found by the rattlesnakes rather than visitors finding it hard to distinguish them."}}
{"Q": "He was sentenced to death. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom committed incest and rape. (B) The cerebral cortex of his brain was damaged.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom committed incest and rape.\nExplanation: Committing incest and rape are serious crimes that can result in the death penalty in some countries or states. The other option, that the cerebral cortex of his brain was damaged, is not a plausible reason for sentencing someone to death as it is not a crime and would not be considered a valid defense in a court of law."}}
{"Q": "Gongress passed some proposals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The economy has been improved a lot. (B) Small buiness benefited from these proposals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Small business benefited from these proposals.\nExplanation: While it is possible that the economy may have improved as a result of Congress passing proposals, it is not a guaranteed outcome. However, it is more likely that small businesses would benefit from these proposals as they often receive targeted support from government policies. Additionally, small businesses are a key driver of economic growth and job creation, so supporting them can have a positive impact on the overall economy."}}
{"Q": "Tom's taste buds on his tongue all lost their function. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom couldn't be able to know the taste of whatever he eats. (B) Tom's body began to regulate, reducing the secretion of adrenal hormones.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom couldn't be able to know the taste of whatever he eats.\n\nExplanation: Taste buds are responsible for detecting different tastes such as sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. If Tom's taste buds lost their function, he would not be able to taste any of these flavors, making it difficult for him to enjoy food and potentially affecting his appetite. The loss of taste buds would not have any direct impact on the secretion of adrenal hormones, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His thyroid can't uptake iodine normally. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He mistook lots of thiocyanate. (B) Tom was advised to take in necessary minerals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He mistook lots of thiocyanate.\n\nExplanation: Thiocyanate is a chemical compound that can interfere with the uptake of iodine by the thyroid gland. If someone consumes a lot of thiocyanate, it can lead to a condition called hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland is unable to produce enough thyroid hormones due to a lack of iodine. This can cause a range of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, and depression. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the thyroid's inability to uptake iodine normally is due to the consumption of excessive thiocyanate."}}
{"Q": "This creature has no anatomies. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom decided it isn't a colugo. (B) The doctor diagnosed him with mumps.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom decided it isn't a colugo.\nExplanation: Since the creature has no anatomies, it cannot be identified as a colugo or any other known animal. Therefore, Tom would have to conclude that it is not a colugo. The option B, about the doctor diagnosing him with mumps, is completely unrelated to the given information and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He fed meat to the Jackrabbit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The jackrabbit doesn't eat at all. (B) It chewed the food from its ruminant stomach again.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The jackrabbit doesn't eat at all.\n\nExplanation: Jackrabbits are herbivores and their digestive system is not designed to process meat. Feeding meat to a jackrabbit can cause digestive problems and even lead to death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the jackrabbit would refuse to eat the meat rather than trying to chew it again from its ruminant stomach."}}
{"Q": "Tom perfers beers made with bottom Fermenting yeasts. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He ordered lagers in the bar every time. (B) The doctor said he was malnourished.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He ordered lagers in the bar every time.\nExplanation: Beers made with bottom fermenting yeasts are typically lagers, so it is likely that Tom would prefer to order lagers in the bar every time. This preference does not necessarily have any direct impact on his nutrition or health, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "The species populations in this area changed abnormally over time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Situations of this area got much worse. (B) The process of Succession here was worth exploring.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Situations of this area got much worse.\nExplanation: Abnormal changes in species populations can indicate ecological imbalances, such as the overpopulation of one species or the decline of another. This can lead to negative impacts on the ecosystem, such as the loss of biodiversity, changes in nutrient cycling, and even the collapse of food webs. Therefore, it is more likely that the abnormal changes in species populations resulted in the situations of this area getting much worse, rather than the process of succession being worth exploring."}}
{"Q": "Only beryllium has been left. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This flower's carpel was damaged. (B) Tom has put different kinds of materials in the furnace.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom has put different kinds of materials in the furnace.\nExplanation: Beryllium is a rare element and is not commonly found in nature. It is usually obtained by extracting it from minerals or ores. Therefore, it is unlikely that a damaged flower carpel would be the cause of only beryllium being left. On the other hand, if Tom put different kinds of materials in the furnace, it is possible that the other elements reacted with each other and formed compounds, leaving only beryllium behind. This explanation is more plausible."}}
{"Q": "Pictographs were formed step by step. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The ancients recorded by picture writing. (B) His presentation is divided into several modules.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The ancients recorded by picture writing.\nExplanation: Pictographs were one of the earliest forms of writing, used by ancient civilizations to record information. They were created by drawing pictures that represented objects or ideas, and over time, these pictures became more stylized and abstract, eventually evolving into more complex writing systems. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the formation of pictographs was the ancient practice of recording information through picture writing."}}
{"Q": "My car is exposed to the acid rain,. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It temperature hasn't been influenced. (B) The paint on my car is clipped.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The paint on my car is clipped.\nExplanation: Acid rain contains harmful chemicals that can react with the paint on a car's surface, causing it to deteriorate and become clipped. This can lead to discoloration, rust, and other damage to the car's exterior. While acid rain may not directly affect the temperature of the car, it can have a significant impact on its appearance and overall condition."}}
{"Q": "Jane wanted to buy a book full of maps bound together. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She booked a ticket of a museum. (B) She bought some atlases.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She bought some atlases.\nExplanation: Since Jane wanted a book full of maps bound together, the most plausible option would be for her to buy some atlases. Atlases are books that contain maps of different regions or countries, and they are usually bound together in one volume. Therefore, it makes sense that Jane would buy some atlases to fulfill her need for a book full of maps. Option A, booking a ticket to a museum, does not seem related to Jane's desire for a book of maps."}}
{"Q": "Mary put the cake into the refrigeratory. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary complained that the cake became too dry the next day. (B) Mary found the cake was rich in moisture the next day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Mary found the cake was rich in moisture the next day.\nExplanation: Putting the cake into the refrigerator helps to retain its moisture and freshness. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mary found the cake to be rich in moisture the next day rather than dry."}}
{"Q": "The doctor treated little Tom's autism with medication. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After three months of treatment, his autism has improved significantly. (B) He had a step-by-step process.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. After three months of treatment, his autism has improved significantly.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the doctor treated Tom's autism with medication. The word \"treated\" implies that the doctor was trying to cure or alleviate the symptoms of autism. The sentence also mentions \"little Tom's autism,\" which suggests that he was a child. Autism is a developmental disorder that affects communication and social interaction skills. Medication can be used to manage some of the symptoms of autism, such as anxiety or aggression. Therefore, it is plausible that after three months of treatment, Tom's autism improved significantly. However, it is important to note that medication is not a cure for autism, and each individual's response to treatment may vary."}}
{"Q": "There are many trees with different ages. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They have different textures. (B) Scientists have discovered different stages.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They have different textures.\nExplanation: As trees age, their bark and wood texture changes. Younger trees have smoother bark and softer wood, while older trees have rougher bark and harder, more dense wood. Therefore, it is plausible that trees of different ages would have different textures. On the other hand, while scientists may study the different stages of tree growth, it is not necessarily a direct result of trees having different ages."}}
{"Q": "Gauss strength diminishes the further the distance from the magnetic field. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wrote in his physics exam that gauss refers to the casual strength of a magnetic field of energy. (B) Surface gauss depends on thickness and size of the magnet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Surface gauss refers to the strength of the magnetic field at a specific point on the surface of a magnet. The strength of the magnetic field diminishes with distance from the magnet due to the inverse square law, which states that the strength of the magnetic field decreases with the square of the distance from the magnet. This means that the further away from the magnet, the weaker the magnetic field becomes. The thickness and size of the magnet can also affect the strength of the magnetic field, but this is not the primary cause of the decrease in strength with distance."}}
{"Q": "They are large. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This group of Greys have grown up. (B) Coniferous trees are tall.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This group of Greys have grown up.\nExplanation: The statement \"They are large\" refers to a group of Greys, which are likely a type of animal. The most plausible explanation for their size increase would be that they have grown up, rather than the height of trees in their environment. While trees may contribute to the habitat and food sources available to the Greys, it is unlikely to be the sole cause of their size increase."}}
{"Q": "It can hold water up to two liters. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sink has great capacity. (B) Tom is a mathematician.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions the capacity of holding water, which is related to the sink's ability to hold water. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer than option B, which is irrelevant to the statement."}}
{"Q": "Jack looks at the shape of the rotifers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack sees many particles. (B) He saw their bilateral symmetry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He saw their bilateral symmetry.\nExplanation: Rotifers are microscopic aquatic animals that have a distinct bilateral symmetry, meaning that their bodies can be divided into two equal halves. When Jack looked at the shape of the rotifers, he would have noticed this symmetry, which is a characteristic feature of this group of animals. Option A, which suggests that Jack saw many particles, is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the shape or structure of the rotifers."}}
{"Q": "The doctor's diagnosis confirmed his thought. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom did examinations to see whether he got cancer. (B) Tom had an angiogram at the hospital.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom had an angiogram at the hospital.\nExplanation: The doctor's diagnosis confirmed his thought, which implies that the doctor had a suspicion about Tom's condition before the diagnosis. An angiogram is a medical test that uses X-rays to visualize the blood vessels in the heart. It is usually done to diagnose heart conditions such as blockages or narrowing of the arteries. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom had an angiogram at the hospital, which led to the doctor's diagnosis. Option A, which suggests that Tom did examinations to see whether he got cancer, is not relevant to the given information and is less likely to be the cause of the doctor's diagnosis."}}
{"Q": "Tom believes that dogs and wolves belong to the same phylum. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is wrong. (B) Tom is right.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom is right.\nExplanation: Dogs and wolves both belong to the phylum Chordata, which includes all animals with a notochord (a flexible rod that runs along the length of the body). This phylum also includes other animals such as humans, fish, birds, and reptiles. Therefore, Tom's belief is correct."}}
{"Q": "The light was off at 10 pm. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My pupils became samller suddenly. (B) My pupils became bigger suddenly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. My pupils became bigger suddenly.\nExplanation: When the light is turned off, the environment becomes darker, and our eyes adjust to let in more light. This is done by the dilation of the pupils, which become bigger to allow more light to enter the eye. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that the pupils became bigger suddenly."}}
{"Q": "Susan is a midwife. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The goldfish swim away. (B) She was specially trained in childbirth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She was specially trained in childbirth.\nExplanation: Being a midwife means that Susan has received specialized training in assisting women during childbirth. It has nothing to do with goldfish swimming away, so option A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He invited his partners to his residence. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They entered his residence. (B) In view of employment, China's economic activities have increased after the Reform and Opening Up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that he invited his partners to his residence, which implies that they entered his residence as a result of the invitation. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not related to the sentence and does not provide a logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "Pecan should be stored in the relatively dry environment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) In the humid environment, pecan is easier to grow mold on it. (B) Pecan like humid environment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\n\nExplanation: Pecan is a type of nut that is prone to mold growth in humid environments. Storing pecans in a relatively dry environment helps to prevent mold growth and prolong their shelf life. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer as it explains the reason behind the recommendation to store pecans in a dry environment. Option (B) is not a valid explanation as it contradicts the known fact that pecans are susceptible to mold growth in humid conditions."}}
{"Q": "Another bilogist helps him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The botanist needs natural extraction of Terpenes. (B) This biologist has problems in other scientific fields to solve.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The botanist needs natural extraction of Terpenes.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is A because the botanist may require the help of another biologist who specializes in natural extraction of terpenes. Terpenes are organic compounds found in plants and are commonly used in various industries such as food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. The process of extracting terpenes from plants can be complex and requires specialized knowledge and equipment. Therefore, it is likely that the botanist sought the help of another biologist who has expertise in this area to assist with the extraction process. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not provide a logical reason for why the biologist would help the botanist."}}
{"Q": "As time goes by, their influence on members grows stronger and stronger. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Leaders of pyramid schemes are extremely good at instilling their own perceptions to members. (B) Leaders of pyramid schemes are extremely good at controlling members.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Leaders of pyramid schemes are extremely good at instilling their own perceptions to members.\n\nExplanation: Pyramid scheme leaders often use persuasive tactics to convince members that their scheme is legitimate and profitable. They may use emotional appeals, such as promising financial freedom or appealing to members' desires for success. Over time, these messages can become ingrained in members' minds, making it difficult for them to see the truth about the scheme. Additionally, pyramid scheme leaders may create a sense of community and belonging among members, which can further strengthen their influence."}}
{"Q": "Tom was looking for Amphibians in winter. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He could only found some sleeping. (B) I took him to the natural habitats of rhinos.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He could only found some sleeping.\nExplanation: Amphibians are cold-blooded animals and during winter, they tend to become less active and may even hibernate. Therefore, it is unlikely that Tom would find many active amphibians during winter. The most plausible outcome is that he would only find some sleeping amphibians. Option B is not a plausible answer as rhinos are not related to amphibians and taking Tom to their natural habitats would not help him in his search for amphibians."}}
{"Q": "The murderer didn't accept himself for a whole life. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He didn't achieve wellness. (B) He experienced suicide.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He didn't achieve wellness.\nExplanation: When someone doesn't accept themselves, it can lead to a lack of self-esteem, self-worth, and self-confidence. This can result in mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and even addiction. Without achieving wellness, the murderer may have struggled with these issues throughout their life, making it difficult to find happiness and fulfillment. However, suicide is not the only outcome of not accepting oneself, and it is important to seek help and support to overcome these challenges."}}
{"Q": "He eats very little. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My pet tom is in the mating season. (B) My pet tom is in the growing season.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The fact that the pet tom is in the mating season is more likely to be the cause of him eating very little. During the mating season, male cats may lose their appetite due to hormonal changes and increased activity levels. On the other hand, the growing season is not a relevant factor in this context as it pertains to plants and not animals."}}
{"Q": "Tom's family go hiking on the plain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They find mangroves. (B) They saw many swamps.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: None of the choices are plausible based on the given information. \nExplanation: The question states that Tom's family went hiking on the plain, but neither mangroves nor swamps are typically found on plains. A more plausible answer would be something like \"They enjoyed the scenery and fresh air\" or \"They had a fun and healthy outdoor activity.\""}}
{"Q": "This kind of bear grew in the forest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This kind of bear habitates in the forest. (B) It became a female.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This kind of bear habitates in the forest.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the bear grew in the forest, which means it is likely that it is a species that naturally lives in the forest. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that this kind of bear habitates in the forest. Option B, which suggests that the bear became a female, is not related to the information given in the sentence and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "On the surface of water mains is some solid stuff. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Water with minerals flows in the water mains. (B) Pure water flows in the water mains.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Water with minerals flows in the water mains.\n\nExplanation: The solid stuff on the surface of water mains is likely to be mineral deposits that have accumulated over time. Water naturally contains minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and iron, which can form deposits on the inside of pipes. These deposits can build up over time and eventually become visible on the surface of the water mains. Pure water, on the other hand, would not contain any minerals and would not leave any solid residue on the surface of the pipes. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She had been suffering from diabetes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom neglects personal hygiene. (B) She was particularly fat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She was particularly fat.\nExplanation: Obesity is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Excess body fat can cause insulin resistance, which means the body is unable to use insulin effectively to regulate blood sugar levels. This can lead to high blood sugar levels and eventually diabetes. While personal hygiene may have an impact on overall health, it is not directly linked to the development of diabetes."}}
{"Q": "Testicles descend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is in the breeding season. (B) The woman was pregnant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Testicles descend in male animals during the breeding season as a result of hormonal changes. This allows for the production and release of sperm for reproduction. The woman being pregnant would have no effect on the descent of testicles in a male animal."}}
{"Q": "He opened his mouth. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The anaconda saw his food in the forest. (B) The mayor gathered the people of the whole city in the square.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The mayor gathered the people of the whole city in the square.\nExplanation: The cause of him opening his mouth is not related to an anaconda seeing its food in the forest. However, it is plausible that he opened his mouth in response to the mayor gathering the people of the whole city in the square, perhaps to speak or address the crowd."}}
{"Q": "The rope connected to my dog was broken. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Other boys followed to joint it. (B) It ran to other's areas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It ran to other's areas.\nExplanation: Since the rope connected to the dog was broken, the dog would have been free to run away. Therefore, it is more plausible that the dog ran to other areas rather than other boys following to joint it."}}
{"Q": "His legs are entangled in duckweed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was walking in the jungle. (B) Tom was standing in the river and can't move a step.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom was standing in the river and can't move a step.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's legs got entangled in duckweed while he was standing in the river and not while walking in the jungle. Duckweed is a common aquatic plant that floats on the surface of still or slow-moving water bodies like rivers, ponds, and lakes. It is possible that Tom was standing in the river and the duckweed got tangled around his legs, making it difficult for him to move. Walking in the jungle would not likely result in getting entangled in duckweed as it is not a plant commonly found in that environment."}}
{"Q": "Tom observed that most of them contain several associated centromeres. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom searched the typical structure of fullerenes. (B) Tom observed the nucleoli of different kinds of chromosomes under the optical microscope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Tom observed the nucleoli of different kinds of chromosomes under the optical microscope. The presence of several associated centromeres is a characteristic of certain types of chromosomes, such as metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes. This observation can be made by examining the chromosomes under a microscope, which is a common technique used in cytogenetics. Tom did not search for the typical structure of fullerenes, as this is not relevant to the observation of chromosomes."}}
{"Q": "The research set specific aspartate sites. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Caspases cleave target proteins. (B) He found that there were some dinoflagellates.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Caspases cleave target proteins.\nExplanation: Aspartate sites are known to be cleaved by caspases, which are enzymes involved in programmed cell death. Therefore, if specific aspartate sites were identified in the research, it is likely that caspases would cleave the target proteins at those sites. Option B, which mentions dinoflagellates, is not related to the topic and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "We succeed in the end. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Our fate has been changed. (B) Voldemort became the ultimate villain in the end.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Our fate has been changed.\nExplanation: The statement \"We succeed in the end\" implies that the outcome was positive and that the characters achieved their goals. This suggests that their actions had an impact on the course of events, and that their success changed the outcome of the story. Therefore, it is more plausible that their fate has been changed rather than Voldemort becoming the ultimate villain in the end, as this would imply a negative outcome."}}
{"Q": "Their cotyledons are destroyed first. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The tardigrades are threatened. (B) Some plants are infected by a rare kind of virus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Tardigrades are known to feed on plant material, and if they are threatened or in need of food, they may consume the cotyledons of plants. This is a more plausible explanation than plants being infected by a rare kind of virus, as viruses typically do not target specific plant structures like cotyledons."}}
{"Q": "They went to catch eels today. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many were found after seeing a leaking head in crevices. (B) Both of them took Penicillins and recovered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Many were found after seeing a leaking head in crevices.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible as it suggests that the group was successful in catching eels. The description of finding eels in crevices is also a common method of catching them. Option B, on the other hand, is not related to catching eels and seems unlikely as taking Penicillins is not a typical activity when catching eels."}}
{"Q": "The goats died of blood shortage. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The eucalyptus all died from lack of water. (B) Tom's goats were attacked by vampires.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The eucalyptus trees dying from lack of water could have caused the goats to die of blood shortage. Eucalyptus leaves are a common food source for goats, and if the trees were not getting enough water, the leaves would not have enough moisture to sustain the goats' blood supply. This is a more plausible explanation than the unlikely scenario of Tom's goats being attacked by vampires."}}
{"Q": "This user spent over 8 hours a day at this site. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The usage rate of this company's products rose from second to first. (B) This user had a high level of stickiness.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. This user had a high level of stickiness.\nExplanation: Spending over 8 hours a day on a website indicates a high level of engagement and loyalty to the site, which is known as stickiness. This means that the user is more likely to return to the site and recommend it to others, but it does not necessarily mean that the usage rate of the company's products rose from second to first. Stickiness is a measure of user behavior, while usage rate is a measure of product adoption."}}
{"Q": "Lucy gave me a pen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I added black ink into it. (B) I bought ink for the pen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Since Lucy gave you a pen, it is more plausible that you would need to buy ink for the pen rather than adding ink into it. Adding ink into a pen would require disassembling the pen and having access to ink, which is not a common practice for most people. Therefore, it is more likely that you would need to buy ink for the pen in order to use it."}}
{"Q": "A carpenter will be recruited. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The family cannot afford the tuition for the three children. (B) We need a person skilled in all aspects of construction.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that a carpenter will be recruited because there is a need for a person skilled in all aspects of construction. This suggests that the reason for recruiting a carpenter is related to the construction work that needs to be done, rather than financial difficulties faced by the family. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is American. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is a homo. (B) Tom was born and brought up in Indinana.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Tom was born and brought up in Indiana.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as nationality is usually determined by the country of birth or citizenship. Being a homo has no correlation with one's nationality."}}
{"Q": "The body decomposes gradually. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Some enzymes are working on the dead body of a bird. (B) The clinical manifestations of wilson disease mainly are dyskinesia such as limb tremor, bradykinesia, gait instability and lmental symptoms such as lethargy, mental behavior changes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The gradual decomposition of a body is caused by the action of enzymes that break down the tissues and organs. These enzymes are produced by bacteria and other microorganisms that colonize the body after death. The process of decomposition is influenced by various factors such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of insects and scavengers. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it explains the biological process of decomposition. Option B is unrelated to the question and describes the clinical manifestations of Wilson disease, which is a genetic disorder that affects copper metabolism in the body."}}
{"Q": "Many goods have been reduced in price recently. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Deflation makes all kinds of shops miserable. (B) Buys are satisfied with the  trend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Buys are satisfied with the trend.\nExplanation: When goods are reduced in price, it means that consumers can purchase more for less money. This leads to increased satisfaction among buyers as they are able to save money and potentially buy more goods than they would have been able to before. Deflation may have negative effects on the economy as a whole, but in the short term, consumers are likely to be happy with lower prices."}}
{"Q": "Judy suffered from tics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The vet asserted it has panleukopenia. (B) She had involuntary movements in her body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Tics are involuntary movements or sounds that a person cannot control. Therefore, it is more plausible that Judy had involuntary movements in her body as a result of her tics. Option A, which suggests that the vet asserted she had panleukopenia, is not related to tics and seems like a random statement."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to have a bath. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom filled the bath tub with hot water. (B) His owner poured a bowl of water for him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom filled the bath tub with hot water.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom, who is likely a human, would fill a bath tub with hot water to take a bath rather than his owner pouring a bowl of water for him like a pet."}}
{"Q": "This monster was pleased. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This monster killed a boy. (B) This monster saved a boy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This monster saved a boy.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a monster would be pleased after saving someone rather than after killing someone. Saving a life would be a positive action that could bring satisfaction or happiness to the monster, while killing someone would likely bring negative emotions such as guilt or remorse."}}
{"Q": "Hardwoods are deciduous. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They lose their leaves each fall. (B) There is mud to help them grow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They lose their leaves each fall.\nExplanation: Deciduous trees, including hardwoods, shed their leaves annually in response to changes in temperature and daylight hours. This adaptation allows them to conserve water and energy during the winter months when resources may be scarce. Mud does not play a significant role in the growth of deciduous trees."}}
{"Q": "The scientist finds that aeration also accurs as they grow. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Knowing that live plants will release oxygen as they grow, a scientist makes experiments to find more information about their process of growth. (B) There is a research about the cultivation of bateria.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the scientist found that aeration occurs as plants grow, indicating that the scientist was conducting experiments on live plants. The fact that live plants release oxygen as they grow is a well-known phenomenon, and it is plausible that the scientist was investigating this process further. Choice B, about bacteria cultivation, is not relevant to the statement and therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "John only sells amphetamines. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) After that, he became addicted to these drugs. (B) He only looks for people who have failed other weight loss methods.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John only looks for people who have failed other weight loss methods because amphetamines are often used as appetite suppressants and weight loss aids. It is not necessarily true that he became addicted to the drugs just because he sells them."}}
{"Q": "The reader felt  as though it had human capacities. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The author used Personification to descibe the inanimate object. (B) Some human events were engraved on the people's mind.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The author used Personification to describe the inanimate object.\n\nExplanation: Personification is a literary device in which an inanimate object is given human-like qualities or characteristics. By using personification, the author can make the reader feel as though the object has human capacities, such as emotions, thoughts, or actions. This can help to create a more engaging and relatable reading experience for the audience. Therefore, it is more plausible that the use of personification is the cause of the reader feeling as though the object has human capacities."}}
{"Q": "They found there were  a basilar turn with a cystic cavity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They dissected the human ear to see the structure of cochlea. (B) The dentist in need of cavity samples checked many children's teeth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions a \"basilar turn with a cystic cavity,\" which is a structure found in the cochlea of the inner ear. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the researchers dissected a human ear to study its structure, and this is how they discovered the basilar turn with a cystic cavity. Option B, which involves a dentist checking children's teeth for cavities, is not related to the inner ear and therefore cannot be the cause of this finding."}}
{"Q": "His mother carried the decay-causing bacteria and kissed him. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their mouths were dripping with saliva. (B) He was infected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He was infected.\nExplanation: When someone carries decay-causing bacteria in their mouth, they can easily transfer it to others through kissing or sharing utensils. This can lead to an infection in the other person's mouth, causing decay and other dental problems. Therefore, it is more plausible that the son was infected with the bacteria rather than their mouths dripping with saliva."}}
{"Q": "Workers use acrylamide. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The worker is importing a lot chitin. (B) Oil is lost quickly during drilling.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Acrylamide is commonly used in the oil and gas industry as a flocculant to separate solids from liquids during drilling operations. Therefore, it is more plausible that the worker is using acrylamide due to the oil being lost quickly during drilling rather than importing chitin, which is not commonly used in the oil and gas industry."}}
{"Q": "The insects decreased swiftly in number. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Several moles were introduced into a piece of farmland where harmful insects thrived. (B) The gardener was asked to kill the insects in the garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Several moles were introduced into a piece of farmland where harmful insects thrived.\nExplanation: Introducing moles into a farmland is a natural way of controlling harmful insects. Moles feed on insects, and their presence can significantly reduce the number of harmful insects in the area. Therefore, it is more plausible that the decrease in the number of insects was due to the introduction of moles rather than the gardener killing them."}}
{"Q": "Tom's grandmother is a witch. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many altars have been set up in his courtyard. (B) Her brother sought out a psychoanalyst to treat her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: None of the choices are plausible.\nExplanation: The statement about Tom's grandmother being a witch does not necessarily lead to either of the given choices. It is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about individuals based on their beliefs or practices. A more appropriate response would be to acknowledge and respect Tom's grandmother's beliefs and practices without making unfounded assumptions or judgments."}}
{"Q": "Breast tissue is expected to be activated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Prolactin is needed. (B) The sperm can swim freely.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Prolactin is needed.\nExplanation: Breast tissue is activated during pregnancy and lactation, which is stimulated by the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland and is responsible for the production of milk in the mammary glands. Therefore, the activation of breast tissue is directly related to the presence of prolactin. Sperm swimming freely has no direct correlation with breast tissue activation."}}
{"Q": "Tom majored in kinesiology. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jerry is interested in the study on the oldest dogs living. (B) Tom was interested in studying movement.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom was interested in studying movement.\nExplanation: Kinesiology is the study of human movement, so it is more plausible that Tom chose this major because he was interested in studying movement rather than Jerry's interest in the oldest dogs living."}}
{"Q": "We came to Pygmy land. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They took us in. (B) You can see many birds there.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They took us in.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the Pygmies would take in visitors rather than the presence of birds being the result of arriving in Pygmy land. Additionally, the statement \"we came to Pygmy land\" implies that the focus is on the interaction with the Pygmies rather than the wildlife."}}
{"Q": "He went to a volcano and got some accumulations of unconsolidated materials on the flanks. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He put clay and wax in the sun. (B) Tom wanted some lahars.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom wanted some lahars.\n\nExplanation: Lahars are a type of volcanic mudflow that can occur when unconsolidated materials on the flanks of a volcano are mobilized by heavy rainfall or melting snow and ice. It is possible that Tom went to the volcano specifically to collect these lahars, which can be used for scientific research or other purposes. Option A, on the other hand, does not make sense in the context of the sentence and is not a plausible explanation for the accumulation of unconsolidated materials on the volcano's flanks."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said he was suffering from a skin disease. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The thinning of glomerular basement membrane seriously affected his health. (B) Tom sweats a lot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom sweats a lot.\nExplanation: Excessive sweating can lead to skin irritation and infections, which can result in various skin diseases. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's skin disease is caused by his excessive sweating rather than the thinning of glomerular basement membrane, which is related to kidney function and not directly linked to skin health."}}
{"Q": "He found ways to prevent oxidation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom doesn't know Berkelium. (B) The seller should avoid nature's way of spoiling things like food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The seller should avoid nature's way of spoiling things like food.\nExplanation: The cause of oxidation is the reaction of oxygen with other substances, which can lead to spoilage or degradation. By finding ways to prevent oxidation, the seller can avoid nature's way of spoiling things like food. Tom not knowing Berkelium is irrelevant to the cause of oxidation."}}
{"Q": "She is very good at communicating with others. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Susan's cell phone is very hot after use. (B) She is the best receptionist in her company.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She is the best receptionist in her company.\nExplanation: Being a receptionist requires constant communication with people, whether it's in person, over the phone, or through email. Therefore, it's likely that someone who excels in this role would also be good at communicating with others in general. Susan's job as a receptionist has likely honed her communication skills and given her plenty of opportunities to practice and improve them. On the other hand, choice (A) about Susan's cell phone being hot after use is completely unrelated and doesn't make sense as a cause for her communication skills."}}
{"Q": "His friend saw the two small front limbs on that photo. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jessy saw a picture of spine. (B) The man took a photo of the bipe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jessy saw a picture of spine.\nExplanation: The presence of two small front limbs in a photo is not a characteristic of a bipe (an imaginary creature with two legs and two arms). It is more likely that the photo Jessy's friend saw was of a spine, which has two small front limbs called transverse processes. These processes are not functional limbs, but rather serve as attachment points for muscles and ligaments."}}
{"Q": "He can't see clearly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There must be something wrong with his nose. (B) There must be something wrong with the nuclei in his brainstem.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There must be something wrong with the nuclei in his brainstem.\nExplanation: The brainstem is responsible for controlling many vital functions of the body, including vision. If there is something wrong with the nuclei in the brainstem, it can affect the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain, resulting in blurry or unclear vision. On the other hand, there is no direct connection between the nose and vision, so option (A) is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a weak photosensitivity. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom only knew three parts of speech. (B) He was allergic to the sunshine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Photosensitivity is a condition where a person becomes sensitive to light, which can cause skin rashes, hives, and other allergic reactions. It does not affect a person's knowledge of grammar or language, so option A is not a plausible answer. Option B is more likely because it describes a possible consequence of photosensitivity."}}
{"Q": "The researcher marked the different allotropes of sulphur. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The researcher found five types of sulphur. (B) Among them the researcher found the toxic oxidants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The researcher found five types of sulphur.\nExplanation: Allotropes are different forms of the same element, and sulfur has several allotropes, including rhombic, monoclinic, plastic, amorphous, and cyclo-octasulfur. Therefore, it is plausible that the researcher marked the different allotropes of sulfur and found five types of sulfur. The information provided in the question does not suggest anything about the researcher finding toxic oxidants."}}
{"Q": "The whole kitchen was burnt down more quickly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bill put oil on the firewood. (B) Tom put his porridge into the microwave oven.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Putting oil on firewood can cause a rapid spread of fire and can easily lead to a kitchen fire. On the other hand, putting porridge in a microwave oven may cause a small fire, but it is unlikely to cause the entire kitchen to burn down quickly. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor gave him some medicine containing spectinomycin. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wiped those nourishment on the tissue. (B) Lucy has suffered from the gonococcal infection when she was pregnant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Spectinomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat gonococcal infections, which are caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person was given spectinomycin because they had contracted a gonococcal infection, possibly from Lucy who had the infection during pregnancy. Option A does not provide any information related to the use of spectinomycin."}}
{"Q": "The doctor used antipyretic to treat her fever. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A woman got infectious in her wound, which led to bacteremia. (B) The doctor traced the sources of this toxin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Antipyretics are medications used to reduce fever. Fever is often a symptom of an infection, such as bacteremia, which is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. Choice A suggests that the woman's fever was caused by an infection in her wound that led to bacteremia, making it a more plausible answer. Choice B, on the other hand, suggests that the doctor traced the sources of a toxin, which is not directly related to the use of antipyretics to treat a fever."}}
{"Q": "Jack put amylase into starch. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The breakdown of starch is accelerated. (B) The food in his body digested quickly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The breakdown of starch is accelerated.\nExplanation: Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simpler sugars such as glucose. When amylase is added to starch, it accelerates the breakdown process, resulting in the production of simpler sugars. This process is important in digestion, as it allows the body to absorb nutrients more efficiently. However, it does not necessarily mean that the food in Jack's body will digest quickly, as there are many other factors that affect the speed of digestion."}}
{"Q": "He often catches walleye. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Peter likes to go fishing by the lake in spring. (B) He lives in the coastal area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Peter likes to go fishing by the lake in spring.\nExplanation: The fact that Peter often catches walleye suggests that he is intentionally fishing for them. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this, as walleye are a common fish found in lakes and are often caught during the spring season. Option B, on the other hand, is less likely as walleye are not typically found in coastal areas."}}
{"Q": "He recently was diagnosed with the multiple sclerosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has wristed his hands. (B) Tom suffered from the demyelination many years ago.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that occurs due to the damage to the myelin sheath that covers nerve fibers in the central nervous system. Demyelination is the process of damage to the myelin sheath, which can lead to multiple sclerosis. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Tom suffered from demyelination many years ago, which eventually led to his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Option A, on the other hand, is not related to the cause of multiple sclerosis."}}
{"Q": "There are different kinds of weather in different places on the earth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People are praying for more corns this year. (B) It is much colder along fault lines.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: It is much colder along fault lines.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because different weather patterns can affect temperature, and fault lines are areas where tectonic plates meet and can cause changes in temperature due to geological activity. Praying for more corns is not a logical result of different weather patterns."}}
{"Q": "Luke's backbones received outside pressure. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His rigid bones bent. (B) Luke has the right to hold concils.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His rigid bones bent.\nExplanation: When a rigid structure like bones receive outside pressure, they are likely to bend or break. In this case, Luke's backbones would have bent due to the pressure. Option B is not related to the given information and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gems are precious. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Everyone cherishes the gem as the treasure although there are something else in the mineral kingdom. (B) They company with their wives and never leave them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Everyone cherishes the gem as the treasure although there are something else in the mineral kingdom.\nExplanation: Gems are considered precious because of their rarity, beauty, and value. As a result, people tend to cherish them and consider them as treasures. However, there are other minerals in the kingdom that are also valuable and rare, but gems have a special place in human culture and history. Therefore, it is more plausible that people would cherish gems rather than suddenly become more faithful to their spouses (option B)."}}
{"Q": "Jack is a hairdresser. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His hands were corroded by chemical products. (B) He or she tends to be allergic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack would develop allergies from exposure to hair products rather than his hands being corroded by chemical products. Hairdressers are often exposed to a variety of chemicals such as hair dyes, perms, and styling products, which can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. Therefore, it is more likely that Jack would develop allergies as a result of his profession."}}
{"Q": "Tom submitted my ideas as his own. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He became excited. (B) He was accused of plagarism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He was accused of plagiarism.\nExplanation: If Tom submitted someone else's ideas as his own, it is considered plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would face consequences such as being accused of plagiarism rather than becoming excited."}}
{"Q": "His eyes were lack in light-gathering agents. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His body's resistent to infection was lowered. (B) He should eat more carrots which is rich in carotenoids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His body's resistance to infection was lowered.\n\nExplanation: Light-gathering agents, also known as photoreceptors, are responsible for detecting light and transmitting signals to the brain for visual processing. If someone's eyes lack these agents, it means they have a vision impairment or disorder, such as night blindness or age-related macular degeneration. This condition does not directly affect the body's ability to fight off infections. However, some studies suggest that people with vision impairments may have a weakened immune system due to chronic stress and inflammation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person's lowered immune system is a result of their vision impairment rather than a lack of carotenoids in their diet."}}
{"Q": "Tom was a homosexual. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He also had basic needs to make love as others. (B) The hospital put him in an isolation ward and sterilized him daily.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He also had basic needs to make love as others.\nExplanation: Being homosexual does not necessarily lead to any specific consequences. However, it is important to recognize that individuals who identify as homosexual have the same basic needs and desires as anyone else, including the need for intimacy and love. It is not appropriate or ethical to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation. Option B is not a plausible answer as it suggests a cruel and inhumane response to someone's sexual orientation."}}
{"Q": "He produced wonderful literature based on his experience. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Hemingway had a rich life experience. (B) This boy has little life experience.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Hemingway had a rich life experience.\nExplanation: Hemingway was known for his adventurous lifestyle, which included serving in World War I, reporting on the Spanish Civil War, and going on safaris in Africa. He drew inspiration from these experiences and incorporated them into his writing, resulting in a body of work that is rich in detail and authenticity. Therefore, it is more plausible that his wonderful literature was a result of his rich life experience rather than the opposite."}}
{"Q": "The patient is plagued by weakness. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The patient suffers from post-polio syndrome. (B) Loggerheads atre abundant in the sea.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The patient suffers from post-polio syndrome.\nExplanation: Post-polio syndrome is a condition that affects people who have had polio in the past. It is characterized by weakness, fatigue, and muscle pain. This is a more plausible answer than B, which is unrelated to the patient's symptoms."}}
{"Q": "Tom is taking a course in cryobiology. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When he does experiments, he needs to freeze the biological specimens in advance for observation. (B) He took use of stoichimetry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Cryobiology is the study of the effects of low temperatures on living organisms. Therefore, it is likely that Tom would need to freeze biological specimens in advance for observation as part of his experiments in this field. Stoichiometry, on the other hand, is a branch of chemistry that deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions, and it is not directly related to cryobiology."}}
{"Q": "Temperature in this house can be very low in winter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This house has some infiltration problem. (B) These people lives on the torrid zone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that this house has some infiltration problem. Infiltration refers to the uncontrolled flow of air from outside to inside a building through cracks, gaps, and other openings. In winter, this can lead to cold air entering the house and lowering the temperature. On the other hand, living in the torrid zone would mean that the temperature is generally warm or hot throughout the year, so option B is not a likely cause of low temperatures in the house during winter."}}
{"Q": "Emily has many beautiful dolls. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Each of them has a fashion hairstyle. (B) They are popular.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They are popular.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Emily's dolls became popular because they are beautiful, rather than each of them having a fashion hairstyle. Having many beautiful dolls would attract attention and admiration from others, leading to their popularity."}}
{"Q": "The physics teacher will explain the nature of current in this lesson. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He talked a lot about current loads. (B) It indicates the time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He talked a lot about current loads.\nExplanation: Since the topic of the lesson is the nature of current, it is more plausible that the physics teacher would talk about current loads, which are related to the flow of electric charge in a circuit. Option (B) is not relevant to the topic of the lesson and does not make sense in the context."}}
{"Q": "He found many trees with good branches. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jason planted pineapples in the direct-sunlight place. (B) Bob wants to study photosynthesis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Bob wants to study photosynthesis.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bob's interest in studying photosynthesis led him to search for trees with good branches, which are necessary for conducting experiments related to photosynthesis. On the other hand, planting pineapples in a direct-sunlight place does not seem to be related to finding trees with good branches."}}
{"Q": "The customer considered geomancy  very important. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The house selling girl emphasized the high price of the house. (B) The house selling girl emphasized the spiritual ecology of the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Since the customer considered geomancy very important, it is likely that they were interested in the spiritual and energy aspects of the house. Therefore, the house selling girl would emphasize the spiritual ecology of the house, such as its feng shui or energy flow, to appeal to the customer's interests and values. Emphasizing the high price of the house would not necessarily be relevant to the customer's interest in geomancy."}}
{"Q": "They can live well in winter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They dig to the subsoil. (B) Seals are mammals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Many animals that live in cold climates have adaptations to help them survive the harsh winter conditions. One such adaptation is digging to the subsoil, where temperatures are more stable and warmer than on the surface. This allows animals to conserve energy and avoid exposure to the cold. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer than option B, which is not directly related to the ability of animals to survive in winter."}}
{"Q": "His mother's bone began to lose rapidly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom had an osteoma. (B) His mother has just gone through menopause.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. His mother has just gone through menopause.\nExplanation: Menopause is a natural process in women where the production of estrogen decreases, leading to a decrease in bone density. This can result in osteoporosis, a condition where bones become weak and brittle. Osteoma, on the other hand, is a benign tumor that does not affect bone density. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The bulk of the heart's mass was negatively affected. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The heart contracted. (B) This disease caused degenerative changes of the myocardium in Tom's heart.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This disease caused degenerative changes of the myocardium in Tom's heart.\n\nExplanation: The statement suggests that there was a negative impact on the bulk of the heart's mass. This is more likely to be caused by a disease that affects the heart muscle or myocardium, rather than a normal contraction of the heart. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the heart muscle has undergone degenerative changes, which could lead to a decrease in the mass of the heart."}}
{"Q": "My baby was baptized. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Father gave my baby immersion. (B) The whole famly has made a complete plan.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The Father gave my baby immersion.\nExplanation: Baptism is a religious sacrament that involves the immersion or sprinkling of water on a person's head, symbolizing purification and admission into the Christian church. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the baby's baptism was the Father giving the baby immersion, rather than the whole family making a complete plan."}}
{"Q": "Tom wandered in the early spring. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom saw penguins. (B) Tom saw snowdrops.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom saw snowdrops.\nExplanation: Since it is mentioned that Tom wandered in the early spring, it is more plausible that he saw snowdrops, which are one of the first flowers to bloom in the spring, rather than penguins, which are typically found in cold climates and not associated with springtime."}}
{"Q": "I am a citizen with all legal rights. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I have enfranchisement regardless of my nationality. (B) They hardened.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I have enfranchisement regardless of my nationality.\nExplanation: Enfranchisement refers to the granting of citizenship and the right to vote. Therefore, if someone is a citizen with all legal rights, they would have enfranchisement regardless of their nationality. Option B, \"they hardened,\" does not make sense in this context and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I lack vitamin C. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My mom buys oranges for me. (B) I have it by drinking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: When someone lacks vitamin C, they may experience symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and a weakened immune system. One of the best sources of vitamin C is oranges, so it would make sense for the person's mom to buy oranges for them to help increase their vitamin C intake and alleviate these symptoms. Drinking may not necessarily provide enough vitamin C to address the deficiency."}}
{"Q": "Their nomadic lives were broken. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Parakeets were caught by hunters in their natural environment. (B) Budgerigars live on cliffs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the nomadic lives of a certain group of birds were disrupted. Option A provides a more plausible reason for this as it states that the birds were caught by hunters in their natural environment. This would have caused a disturbance in their population and migration patterns, leading to a break in their nomadic lives. Option B, on the other hand, is not relevant to the given statement and does not provide a logical explanation for the situation."}}
{"Q": "Mary wants to cook in the kitchen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor measures her weight. (B) Mary find the kitchen in a restaurant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Mary starts cooking in the kitchen.\nExplanation: Since Mary wants to cook in the kitchen, the most plausible answer is that she starts cooking in her own kitchen or in someone else's kitchen. Option (A) about the doctor measuring her weight is unrelated to the question, and option (B) about Mary finding the kitchen in a restaurant is unlikely since the question does not mention her being in a restaurant."}}
{"Q": "She can have a rest after the daytime. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy works in a courthouse. (B) Lucy works in a bar.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy works in a courthouse.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lucy works in a courthouse as it is a more formal and professional setting where employees are likely to have designated break times. In contrast, working in a bar may involve longer and irregular hours, making it less likely for employees to have a set time for rest during the day."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has reached her sexual maturity. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She had involuntary movements in her body. (B) Her menstruation starts.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Her menstruation starts.\nExplanation: Menstruation is a clear sign of sexual maturity in females. It is a natural process that occurs when the body prepares for pregnancy. The onset of menstruation is a result of hormonal changes in the body, which indicates that the female reproductive system is fully developed. Involuntary movements in the body are not a typical sign of sexual maturity. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was shocked. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He went to Africa and saw camels. (B) Tom saw a typical virago for the first time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom saw a typical virago for the first time.\nExplanation: Seeing a typical virago for the first time could be a shocking experience for someone, especially if they were not familiar with such a character. On the other hand, seeing camels in Africa may be surprising, but it is not necessarily a shocking experience. Therefore, option B seems to be a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The percentage of oxygen is low in water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Iguanas have difficulty in breathing. (B) Vehicles of too big sizes cannot enter it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Iguanas have difficulty in breathing.\nExplanation: Oxygen is essential for respiration in most animals, including iguanas. If the percentage of oxygen in water is low, it can lead to a lack of oxygen for aquatic animals, making it difficult for them to breathe. This can be harmful to their health and survival. On the other hand, the percentage of oxygen in water does not affect the ability of vehicles to enter it, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The vegetation there is exceptionally vigorous. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This place is warm and humid. (B) The rain forest abounds with rain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The rain forest abounds with rain.\nExplanation: Rain forests are known for their high levels of rainfall, which can range from 80 to 400 inches per year. This abundant rainfall provides the necessary moisture for plants to grow and thrive, leading to exceptionally vigorous vegetation. While warmth and humidity can also contribute to plant growth, the primary factor in the lush vegetation of rain forests is the amount of rainfall they receive."}}
{"Q": "His wound no longer hurts, and he fainted after being excited. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor gave him a dose of medicine. (B) He took opium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor gave him a dose of medicine.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the doctor gave him a painkiller or sedative to alleviate his pain and excitement, which caused him to faint. Taking opium would not necessarily alleviate pain or cause fainting, and it is not a common or recommended treatment for either symptom."}}
{"Q": "He found its jaw. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The zebre saw a lion. (B) Tom cut the head of the perch.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom cut the head of the perch.\nExplanation: If Tom cut the head of the perch, it is likely that the jaw was still attached to the head and therefore would have been found when the head was removed. On the other hand, if a zebra saw a lion, it is unlikely that the zebra would have left behind only its jaw. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Weightlifters train very hard. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their muscles grow fast. (B) They are constantly learning new skills.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Their muscles grow fast.\nExplanation: Weightlifting is a form of resistance training that involves lifting weights to build strength and muscle mass. When weightlifters train hard, their muscles are subjected to stress and micro-tears, which then repair and grow stronger and larger during rest periods. This process is known as muscle hypertrophy and is a well-known physiological response to weightlifting. Therefore, it is more plausible that weightlifters' muscles grow fast as a result of their hard training rather than constantly learning new skills."}}
{"Q": "He used the picture of its dense pulses to prove his opinion. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He portrayed the tree as if it had human capabilities in his essay. (B) The phonetician said the sound has a high frequency.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The phonetician said the sound has a high frequency.\n\nExplanation: The use of the picture of dense pulses suggests that the person was trying to prove something related to sound or frequency. Option B states that the phonetician said the sound has a high frequency, which could be the reason why the person used the picture of dense pulses to support their opinion. This option seems more plausible than option A, which suggests that the person portrayed the tree as having human capabilities, which is not related to the use of the picture of dense pulses."}}
{"Q": "The pond is teemed with eggs. . What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack often goes to the pond to watch tadpoles. (B) The frogs have spawned these days.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The frogs have spawned these days.\nExplanation: The word \"teemed\" suggests a large number of eggs, which is a common occurrence during the breeding season of frogs. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the eggs in the pond is due to the frogs spawning rather than Jack's observation of tadpoles."}}
{"Q": "Sally's throat is severely inflamed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sally cannot make any sound. (B) Her sight was harmed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sally cannot make any sound.\nExplanation: When the throat is severely inflamed, it can cause difficulty in speaking or making any sound due to the pain and swelling in the vocal cords. However, inflammation in the throat does not affect the eyesight, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The birds located this zone as habitat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) No part of zones is good for living. (B) This part of zone is comfortable for birds to live.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This part of zone is comfortable for birds to live.\nExplanation: Birds are known to choose habitats that provide them with the necessary resources for survival, such as food, water, shelter, and breeding sites. Therefore, it is more plausible that the birds located this zone as habitat because it provides them with a comfortable living environment, rather than there being no other suitable options available."}}
{"Q": "He found a lot of taurine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John was studying the cellular composition of mammals. (B) My son wanted to learn distribution of plant species.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Taurine is an amino acid that is found in high concentrations in mammalian tissues, particularly in the heart and brain. Therefore, it is more likely that John was studying the cellular composition of mammals, rather than his son wanting to learn about the distribution of plant species, which would not be related to taurine."}}
{"Q": "Kate felt surprised and novel. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mother told Kate how the Osprey carried food. (B) Kate's mother tells Kate fairy tales every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Kate felt surprised and novel because her mother told her how the Osprey carried food. This is a new and interesting piece of information for Kate, which is why she felt surprised and novel. On the other hand, listening to fairy tales every day may not necessarily make Kate feel surprised and novel as she may have heard them before. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The subjects' heart rates varied widely. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor touched the subject's breast. (B) The doctor touched the subject's shoulder.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neither (A) nor (B) can be a plausible answer as they do not have any direct correlation with heart rate variability. The cause of the subjects' heart rate variability could be due to various factors such as physical activity, stress, anxiety, medication, or underlying medical conditions. Without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact cause of the variability."}}
{"Q": "The country lacks carbohydrates. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They are short of the primary source of fuel. (B) Nutritionists suggest balanced food mix.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They are short of the primary source of fuel.\nExplanation: Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body. If a country lacks carbohydrates, it means that the people in that country are not getting enough energy to carry out their daily activities. This can lead to a number of health problems, including fatigue, weakness, and malnutrition. Therefore, it is important for the country to find alternative sources of carbohydrates or import them from other countries to ensure that the people have enough energy to lead healthy and productive lives. Nutritionists may suggest a balanced food mix, but this alone may not be enough to address the problem of carbohydrate deficiency."}}
{"Q": "The little pigeons that he nurtures can fly faster. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Harry always uses little pigeons to deliver letters. (B) Harry keeps pairing two flying pigeons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Harry keeps pairing two flying pigeons.\nExplanation: Pairing two flying pigeons can result in offspring with better flying abilities due to genetic traits passed down from both parents. This is a common practice in pigeon breeding to improve the quality of racing or homing pigeons. Therefore, it is more plausible that Harry's little pigeons can fly faster because he has been selectively breeding them for better flying abilities. Option (A) is not a likely cause as using little pigeons to deliver letters does not necessarily improve their flying abilities."}}
{"Q": "Scientists arrived in the ice free coastal areas of the Arctic highlands to investigate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists observe the reproduction process of perch. (B) Scientists want to study narwhals in the summer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Scientists wanting to study narwhals in the summer is a more plausible answer because narwhals are known to migrate to the Arctic highlands during the summer months. The ice-free coastal areas provide easier access for scientists to study these animals and their behavior. Additionally, narwhals are a unique and interesting species to study due to their long tusks and mysterious behavior. The reproduction process of perch may also be of interest to scientists, but it is less likely to be the sole reason for their arrival in the Arctic highlands."}}
{"Q": "He was diagnosed with a kind of syndrome. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom suffers from hypocalcemia. (B) Tom got infected by something unknown.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom suffers from hypocalcemia.\nExplanation: Hypocalcemia is a medical condition where the level of calcium in the blood is too low. This can lead to various symptoms, including muscle cramps, seizures, and abnormal heart rhythms. It is a plausible cause for a syndrome diagnosis, as it can affect multiple systems in the body. On the other hand, option B is too vague and lacks specific details about the cause of the syndrome. Therefore, option A is a more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "Alan coated his skin with beeswax. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was poisoned. (B) He tore off the beeswax and successfully depilated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He tore off the beeswax and successfully depilated.\nExplanation: Beeswax is commonly used in depilatory products to remove hair. By coating his skin with beeswax, Alan was likely attempting to remove unwanted hair. The most plausible outcome would be that he successfully depilated by tearing off the beeswax along with the hair, rather than being poisoned by the beeswax."}}
{"Q": "Tom's father is a chef. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has a recipe of the dishes that he is good at. (B) Tom wants to show off his cooking skills.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's father, being a chef, has a recipe of the dishes that he is good at. It is common for chefs to have their own signature dishes or recipes that they have perfected over time. This does not necessarily mean that Tom wants to show off his cooking skills, as there could be many other reasons why he might want to cook."}}
{"Q": "He was surprised at their ways similar to multicellular animals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The experimenter expected the Paramecium has a special way of consuming food. (B) Tom has met two plesiosaurs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the experimenter had a preconceived notion about how Paramecium consumes food, and was surprised to find out that their ways were similar to multicellular animals. This implies that the experimenter expected Paramecium to have a unique way of consuming food, which turned out to be untrue. Option B is irrelevant to the context and does not provide a plausible explanation."}}
{"Q": "She didn't cared about her latency. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy has taken a vague photo. (B) The kid hoped to stay away from learning.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: The statement \"She didn't cared about her latency\" suggests that Lucy was not concerned about the delay in her response or action. Option A, which states that Lucy has taken a vague photo, is a more plausible reason for her lack of concern about latency. If Lucy has taken a vague photo, it means that she is not expecting any immediate response or action from the recipient, and hence, she may not be worried about the latency. On the other hand, option B, which states that the kid hoped to stay away from learning, does not seem to be related to the given statement and is an unlikely cause for Lucy's lack of concern about latency."}}
{"Q": "The chemist is drawing a tree of the platinum group of metals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He draws ruthenium as one branch of the tree. (B) He draws plastics as one branch of the tree.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He draws ruthenium as one branch of the tree.\nExplanation: The platinum group of metals includes six elements: platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium. Therefore, it is plausible that the chemist would draw ruthenium as one branch of the tree since it is a member of the platinum group. On the other hand, plastics have no relation to the platinum group of metals, so it is unlikely that the chemist would draw plastics as one branch of the tree."}}
{"Q": "Several days later, this lake is filled with microbes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A few microbes live in this lake. (B) Tom accidentally threw some waste containing curium into a lake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the lake was already home to a large number of microbes, rather than Tom accidentally contaminating the lake with a radioactive element. Microbes are common in bodies of water and can quickly multiply under the right conditions, such as warm temperatures and an abundance of nutrients. Therefore, it is more likely that the increase in microbes was due to natural factors rather than human error."}}
{"Q": "The cattle was poisoned. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Farmers always burn stalks. (B) The cattle accidentally ingested nitrate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The cattle accidentally ingested nitrate.\nExplanation: Nitrate poisoning is a common cause of cattle deaths. Nitrate can be found in fertilizers, contaminated water, and certain plants. When cattle ingest too much nitrate, it can cause oxygen deprivation in their blood, leading to death. Burning stalks (option A) may cause air pollution, but it is unlikely to directly poison the cattle. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He eats some capsaicin and the pain is mitigated. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The wound left during an accident causes great pain for Tom. (B) Jack has been suffering from stomach cramps lately.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jack has been suffering from stomach cramps lately.\nExplanation: Capsaicin is a compound found in chili peppers that can help alleviate pain by blocking pain signals to the brain. It is commonly used in topical creams for pain relief. In this scenario, it is more plausible that Jack consumed capsaicin to alleviate his stomach cramps rather than using it to treat a wound left during an accident."}}
{"Q": "The chaps ran into problems. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They managed to slove the problems. (B) The manager solved these problems in time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They managed to solve the problems.\nExplanation: Since the sentence states that the chaps ran into problems, it implies that they faced some difficulties. However, the sentence does not mention any external help or intervention from the manager. Therefore, it is more plausible to assume that the chaps themselves were able to solve the problems they encountered."}}
{"Q": "The chemistry teacher used some polymers for experiments. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He changed its ranges many times. (B) The experiment produced a lot of smoke.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The experiment produced a lot of smoke.\nExplanation: Polymers are large molecules made up of repeating subunits. When subjected to certain conditions, such as heat or chemical reactions, they can undergo changes that may result in the production of smoke or other byproducts. Therefore, it is more plausible that the use of polymers in the experiment resulted in the production of smoke rather than the teacher changing its ranges many times."}}
{"Q": "Tom listened to the advice from his teacher. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He learned about his teacher's experience as well. (B) The teacher told him to open to each moment with calm awareness.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He learned about his teacher's experience as well.\nExplanation: The sentence only states that Tom listened to his teacher's advice, but it does not provide any information about what the advice was or what happened as a result of following it. Therefore, it is more plausible to choose option A, which suggests that Tom gained some knowledge about his teacher's experience while listening to the advice. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is not supported by the information given in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "His father was getting weak and suffering from lung cancer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike was 30 years old. (B) His father often smokes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His father often smokes.\nExplanation: Lung cancer is strongly associated with smoking. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of his father's illness is his smoking habit rather than his son's age."}}
{"Q": "His mother cooked some custards and milk for him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John wanted to eat the first discovered variety of macaques. (B) Tom was hungry when he got up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom was hungry when he got up.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that \"his mother cooked some custards and milk for him\", indicating that the cause of this action was Tom's hunger. Option (A) is irrelevant and does not make sense in the given context. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lymphocytes around the patient's buttom got disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The surrounding vessels were influenced. (B) The patient went into convulsions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The surrounding vessels were influenced.\nExplanation: Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system. If lymphocytes around a particular area of the body get diseased, it can lead to inflammation and affect the surrounding blood vessels. This can cause problems with blood flow and potentially lead to further complications. Convulsions are not a typical symptom of lymphocyte disease, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She eats some laxatives and her colon expels shit swiftly from the bowel. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Linda has suffered from constipation for a week. (B) Anna lacks pepper in her intestinal area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Linda has suffered from constipation for a week.\nExplanation: Laxatives are commonly used to treat constipation by stimulating bowel movements and increasing the frequency of stool passing. Therefore, it is more plausible that Linda's use of laxatives was due to her constipation, rather than a lack of pepper in her intestinal area (which is not a known cause of constipation). The swift expulsion of stool from her colon is a common effect of laxatives."}}
{"Q": "This peccarie was unharmed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom constantly added some salt into a water tank containing halophiles. (B) A peccarie was attacked by a snake with venom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the peccarie was unharmed, which rules out option A as halophiles are salt-loving microorganisms and have no relation to the well-being of the animal. Option B is more plausible as it suggests that the peccarie was attacked by a venomous snake but managed to escape unharmed."}}
{"Q": "My friend found more small bolts for me. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I ran out of ammunition for my crossbow. (B) Smoking will inhale nicotine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: My friend had extra small bolts and offered them to me.\nExplanation: This is the most plausible answer as it directly addresses the situation presented in the question. Option A about running out of ammunition for a crossbow is not relevant to the question and option B about smoking inhaling nicotine is unrelated and does not provide a reason for the friend finding more small bolts."}}
{"Q": "Batteries should not be casually thrown. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom accidentally threw some waste containing curium into a lake. (B) Anything containing caustic mixtures of chemicals should not be casually thrown.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Anything containing caustic mixtures of chemicals should not be casually thrown.\n\nExplanation: Batteries contain chemicals that can be harmful to the environment if not disposed of properly. When batteries are casually thrown, they can release these chemicals into the environment, causing pollution and harm to wildlife. Therefore, it is important to dispose of batteries properly and not casually throw them away. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the topic of batteries and their disposal."}}
{"Q": "Tom felt so nervous in the running competition. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His leg cramps. (B) His natural temperament was affected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His natural temperament was affected.\nExplanation: When someone feels nervous, it can affect their natural temperament and cause them to feel anxious, irritable, or even panicked. It is unlikely that Tom's leg would cramp solely due to feeling nervous, as cramps are usually caused by physical factors such as dehydration or muscle fatigue. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is under the weather. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor prescribed him an emetic. (B) The doctor gave him some medicine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The doctor gave him some medicine.\nExplanation: When someone is \"under the weather,\" it means they are feeling unwell or sick. In this case, it is more plausible that the doctor would prescribe medicine to help alleviate Tom's symptoms rather than an emetic, which is a medication used to induce vomiting and would not be appropriate for most illnesses."}}
{"Q": "It is a freshwater lake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Various species live in this lake. (B) There is no living beings in this lake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Various species live in this lake.\nExplanation: Freshwater lakes are known to support a diverse range of aquatic life, including fish, amphibians, invertebrates, and plants. The presence of freshwater in the lake provides a habitat for these species to thrive. Therefore, it is more plausible that various species live in this lake rather than there being no living beings in the lake."}}
{"Q": "Tom is doing his experiment with his classmate. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His classmate was eliminated. (B) His classmates were a disservice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer based on the given information. \n\nExplanation: The question does not provide any information about what happened during the experiment or what the outcome was. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether Tom's classmate was eliminated or whether his classmates were a disservice. A more plausible answer would be \"Insufficient information provided to answer the question.\""}}
{"Q": "The doctor check the CT of my brain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found that there were some dinoflagellates. (B) He found Abscesses.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He found Abscesses.\nExplanation: CT scans are often used to detect abnormalities in the brain, such as tumors, bleeding, or infections. Dinoflagellates are a type of marine plankton and would not be found in a brain CT scan. Abscesses, on the other hand, are a common finding in brain CT scans and can be caused by infections or other conditions. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He wants to eat a pie. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hobo was extremely hungry. (B) Tom ate a lot of irritants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The hobo was extremely hungry.\nExplanation: The most plausible cause for someone wanting to eat a pie is hunger. Option A states that the hobo was extremely hungry, which is a logical reason for him wanting to eat a pie. Option B, on the other hand, mentions Tom eating irritants, which is not directly related to wanting to eat a pie. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Cannibalism developed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was a rumor that those people had been held in confinement. (B) Those people had been held in confinement for four years.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Cannibalism is often a last resort for survival in extreme situations where there is a lack of food. In this case, the fact that the people had been held in confinement for four years suggests that they were likely in a situation where there was no access to food or resources. This would have led to desperation and the resort to cannibalism as a means of survival. The idea that it was just a rumor seems less plausible as it does not provide a clear reason for why cannibalism would have developed."}}
{"Q": "The swimmer saw shark fins in this water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He chose to leave here. (B) He chose to stay here.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He chose to leave here.\nExplanation: Seeing shark fins in the water is a clear indication of danger. It is highly unlikely that the swimmer would choose to stay in the water and risk being attacked by the sharks. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that he chose to leave the water and find a safer place to swim."}}
{"Q": "It rained for the first time in spring recently. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The roadside is full of wild flowers. (B) The water in the river has dried up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The roadside is full of wild flowers.\nExplanation: Rain is essential for the growth of plants and flowers. Therefore, it is more plausible that the rain would result in the growth of wildflowers on the roadside rather than the drying up of water in the river."}}
{"Q": "All the animals went to participate in the travel competition. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Almost no aspect of man's everyday life would be affected. (B) Albatross won the championship.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Albatross won the championship.\nExplanation: The given statement suggests that all the animals participated in a travel competition, which implies that there was a competition held among the animals. Therefore, it is more plausible that one of the animals, in this case, Albatross, won the championship rather than no aspect of man's everyday life being affected."}}
{"Q": "Jack kept a civet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He thought it was too noisy. (B) Jack can beautify his house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He thought it was too noisy.\nExplanation: Civets are known for their loud vocalizations, especially during mating season. Therefore, it is plausible that Jack found the noise level of the civet to be too high and decided to get rid of it or find a new home for it. Option B, on the other hand, does not make sense as there is no clear connection between keeping a civet and beautifying one's house."}}
{"Q": "Mary goes to the optometrist to check her eyes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She puts some natural essential oils on her clothes. (B) The optometrist diagnoses Mary's vision problem.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The optometrist diagnoses Mary's vision problem.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary's visit to the optometrist would result in a diagnosis of her vision problem rather than her putting natural essential oils on her clothes. The purpose of visiting an optometrist is to have an eye exam and receive a diagnosis or treatment for any vision issues. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "Jack wanted to know why there were different rates of reaction. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Finally he found out by looking at books that enantiomers can exhibit diffrent chemical properties. (B) He decided to study rheology first.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Finally he found out by looking at books that enantiomers can exhibit different chemical properties.\nExplanation: Enantiomers are molecules that are mirror images of each other but cannot be superimposed. They have the same chemical formula and physical properties but can exhibit different chemical properties, including different rates of reaction. By looking at books, Jack was able to learn about this concept and understand why there can be different rates of reaction for enantiomers. Studying rheology, on the other hand, would not necessarily provide an explanation for different rates of reaction."}}
{"Q": "His partners were inspired by him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike was interested in data security. (B) He was of great passion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was of great passion.\nExplanation: When someone is passionate about something, it can be contagious and inspire others around them. Mike's partners were likely inspired by his passion for whatever he was working on, whether it was data security or something else. This passion could have motivated them to work harder and be more invested in the project."}}
{"Q": "He keeps many gnus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He travels with them together for food. (B) The gnus have eaten up the grass on his lawn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Keeping many gnus would likely result in them eating up the grass on his lawn, as gnus are known to be herbivores and require a lot of vegetation to sustain themselves. It is unlikely that he would travel with them for food, as gnus are typically found in the wild and do not require human assistance for food."}}
{"Q": "Some patients worry about recurrences after their recovery. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The virus inside the nerve cell can be reactivated. (B) The chairman passed away.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The virus inside the nerve cell can be reactivated.\n\nExplanation: After a person recovers from a viral infection, the virus may remain dormant inside the nerve cells. In some cases, the virus can be reactivated, leading to a recurrence of the infection. This is particularly true for viruses like herpes simplex virus, which can cause cold sores or genital herpes. Patients who have had a viral infection may worry about recurrences because of the possibility of viral reactivation."}}
{"Q": "Tom's heart beat so slowly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor insert a pacemaker for him. (B) The doctor told him shortly after that he had a heart attack.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor insert a pacemaker for him.\nExplanation: A slow heart rate, also known as bradycardia, can be caused by various factors such as aging, medication, or underlying medical conditions. If the slow heart rate is severe and causing symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or shortness of breath, a pacemaker may be recommended. A pacemaker is a small device that is implanted under the skin and helps regulate the heart rate by sending electrical impulses to the heart muscle. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom received a pacemaker to address his slow heart rate rather than having a heart attack shortly after."}}
{"Q": "The country regained the sovereignty. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It is already five-moths old. (B) The country would not be controlled by others any more in a violent way.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The country would not be controlled by others any more in a violent way.\nExplanation: Regaining sovereignty means that the country has regained control over its own affairs and is no longer under the control of another country or external force. This would mean that the country would be able to make its own decisions and policies without interference from outside forces. The use of the phrase \"in a violent way\" suggests that the country may have previously been under violent control, and regaining sovereignty would mean an end to this violence. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "H was attached to the former by a covalent bond. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The electronegative atom meet the hydrogen H. (B) This atom had reduction and the other had reduction.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: Covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share electrons. In this case, the electronegative atom (the one with a higher affinity for electrons) met the hydrogen atom and shared electrons with it, forming a covalent bond. Option B, which suggests that both atoms underwent reduction, is not a plausible explanation for the formation of a covalent bond."}}
{"Q": "Tom had an epileptic seizure on the street. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's brain was stimulated a lot. (B) Lucy has waited for Tom for a long time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom's brain was stimulated a lot.\n\nExplanation: Epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. This can be triggered by various factors, such as stress, lack of sleep, or excessive stimulation of the brain. In this case, it is likely that Tom's brain was stimulated a lot, which led to the seizure. It is not plausible that Lucy waiting for Tom would cause an epileptic seizure."}}
{"Q": "He got Tom's fortune for the next week. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A man who knows pyromancy looks at the burning fire. (B) It takes Tom a year to understand the operation mode of the company.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's fortune was obtained due to his understanding of the operation mode of the company, which took him a year to comprehend. This suggests that he may have made a wise investment or business decision that resulted in a financial gain. On the other hand, the idea of a man who knows pyromancy looking at a burning fire seems unlikely to have any direct impact on Tom's fortune."}}
{"Q": "Pregnant woman Alice decides to take more folic acid. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She often eats hazelnuts among nuts. (B) This kept her from gaining weight easily.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She often eats hazelnuts among nuts.\nExplanation: Folic acid is a B-vitamin that is important for the development of a healthy fetus. It is commonly found in leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, and nuts, including hazelnuts. By increasing her intake of folic acid, Alice may have chosen to eat more foods that are rich in this nutrient, such as hazelnuts. This would be a plausible outcome of her decision to take more folic acid. Option B, on the other hand, is not directly related to folic acid intake and is therefore less likely to be a result of Alice's decision."}}
{"Q": "This kind of young animal grow rapidly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This kind of young animal is likely to be healthy. (B) This kind of young animal is likely to suffer from  scurvy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Rapid growth in young animals is generally a sign of good health and adequate nutrition. Scurvy, on the other hand, is a condition caused by a lack of vitamin C and is not directly related to growth rate. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mother asks Tom to play the violin in front of relatives. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is very good at piano, accordion and violin. (B) Tom plucks the strings all the time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom plucks the strings all the time.\nExplanation: The question states that Tom's mother asked him to play the violin in front of relatives, but it does not mention anything about his proficiency in playing the instrument. Therefore, option (A) cannot be the correct answer. Option (B) is more plausible because it suggests that Tom may not be very skilled at playing the violin and resorts to plucking the strings instead of playing it properly. This could be a result of lack of practice or interest in the instrument."}}
{"Q": "They eat anything like plants. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are common aquatic plants in South America. (B) Algas became their food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Algas became their food.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the subject in question has a diet that includes plants. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would consume algae, which are aquatic plants, rather than becoming a common aquatic plant themselves in South America."}}
{"Q": "Tom had glibenclamide after drinking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has anemia. (B) Tom wanted to throw up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom wanted to throw up.\nExplanation: Glibenclamide is a medication used to treat diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels. It is not recommended to consume alcohol while taking glibenclamide as it can cause a dangerous drop in blood sugar levels. Symptoms of low blood sugar levels include nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom wanted to throw up after taking glibenclamide and drinking alcohol. Anemia is not a known side effect of glibenclamide."}}
{"Q": "Atmosphere of the two regions are totally different. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His thyroid function was promoted for more intake of iodine. (B) The surfaces of rocky bodies in the two regions are different.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The statement about the atmosphere and regions does not directly relate to thyroid function or iodine intake. However, it is possible that the different atmospheres could affect the surfaces of rocky bodies in the regions, leading to differences in their composition and appearance. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The journalist covered it immediately. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The two women had harsh agruments. (B) This disaster became a hot topic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The word \"immediately\" suggests that the journalist was quick to cover the event, indicating that it was a significant and urgent matter. Option B, which states that the disaster became a hot topic, is a more plausible reason for the journalist's prompt coverage than option A, which suggests that the journalist was covering a personal dispute between two individuals."}}
{"Q": "This kind of wall attracts many wall makers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists have bred a new type of crop with grapes and resistant species. (B) Fiberglass insulation keeps you warm and reduces noise.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The statement about a wall attracting wall makers suggests that it is a desirable type of wall to construct. The only option that could potentially relate to wall construction is option B, which mentions fiberglass insulation. Fiberglass insulation is commonly used in walls to improve energy efficiency and reduce noise transmission, so it is plausible that a wall with this type of insulation would be attractive to those in the construction industry. Option A, which mentions a new type of crop, does not seem relevant to wall construction."}}
{"Q": "Tom has put a bottle of water in the refrigerator. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The water in it remained cool. (B) He got a bottle of ice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The water in it remained cool.\nExplanation: When a bottle of water is put in the refrigerator, the temperature of the water decreases, but it does not freeze completely. Therefore, the water in the bottle would remain cool, but it would not turn into ice. Option A is a more plausible answer as it is based on the scientific principle of refrigeration."}}
{"Q": "The doctor advised him to eat more fiber food. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a phenomenon of liver and bile recycling in his body. (B) He is thirsty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There is a phenomenon of liver and bile recycling in his body.\nExplanation: The doctor advised him to eat more fiber food because it helps in the process of liver and bile recycling in the body. Fiber helps in the digestion process and prevents constipation, which can lead to the accumulation of toxins in the liver. By consuming more fiber, the body can eliminate these toxins and improve overall liver function. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B, \"He is thirsty,\" is not related to the doctor's advice to eat more fiber."}}
{"Q": "They collected its feathers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They got a meadowlark. (B) A python found its prey from a distance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They got a meadowlark.\nExplanation: The collection of feathers is a common practice among bird enthusiasts, especially those who are interested in studying the different species of birds. Meadowlarks are known for their beautiful and distinctive feathers, which may have been the reason why they were collected. On the other hand, a python finding its prey from a distance does not necessarily involve the collection of feathers."}}
{"Q": "Tench are common food for them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A group of  men went to a restaurant for dinner. (B) Families living throughout temperate Eurasia like eating freshwater fish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Tench are a freshwater fish commonly found in temperate Eurasia. It is likely that families living in this region have developed a taste for this type of fish and have incorporated it into their diets. It is unlikely that a group of men going to a restaurant for dinner would have a significant impact on the popularity of tench as a food source."}}
{"Q": "The milk goes bad. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cells of milk have some changes. (B) Mike forgot to add rennet to the milk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The cells of milk have some changes.\nExplanation: Milk is a perishable product that contains living cells, including bacteria. When milk is exposed to air, bacteria start to grow and multiply, causing the milk to spoil. The bacteria break down the lactose in the milk, producing lactic acid, which causes the milk to sour and curdle. Therefore, the most plausible cause of milk going bad is the changes in the cells of milk due to bacterial growth. Option B, forgetting to add rennet, is not a likely cause of milk going bad as rennet is used to coagulate milk for cheese making and has no effect on the spoilage of milk."}}
{"Q": "She wants to be like birds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jane doesn't want to gain any weight. (B) Alice wants to make a toy pony by hand.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jane doesn't want to gain any weight.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jane wants to be like birds because she doesn't want to gain any weight. Birds are known for their lightness and ability to fly, which may be appealing to someone who wants to avoid gaining weight. On the other hand, there is no clear connection between wanting to make a toy pony and wanting to be like birds."}}
{"Q": "It has the function of Glycolysis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments. (B) This enzyme facilitated the breakdown of glucose.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP and NADH in the process. This process is facilitated by the enzyme hexokinase, which catalyzes the first step of glycolysis by converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Therefore, the cause of glycolysis is the presence and activity of this enzyme, not the number of myofilaments in myofibrils."}}
{"Q": "The tips of the chromosome shortens each time the cell divides. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The telomeres shorten as the cell divides. (B) The number of mastodons is becoming less and less.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The telomeres shorten as the cell divides.\n\nExplanation: Telomeres are the protective caps at the end of chromosomes that prevent them from deteriorating or fusing with other chromosomes. Each time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten, and eventually, they become too short to protect the chromosome. This can lead to cell death or malfunction, which can contribute to aging and diseases such as cancer. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Option B is not related to the topic and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom put a magnet in pins while he was cleaning the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Almost all the pins bounced off. (B) Almost all the pins are held together by magnets.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Almost all the pins are held together by magnets.\n\nExplanation: When a magnet is placed near metal objects like pins, it can attract them and hold them together. This is because the magnet creates a magnetic field that affects the metal objects. Therefore, it is more plausible that the pins would be held together by the magnet rather than bouncing off."}}
{"Q": "Tom has studied about polypeptides. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has a clear understanding of this problem. (B) He has separated many amino acids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He has a clear understanding of this problem.\nExplanation: Studying about polypeptides would give Tom knowledge about the structure and function of these molecules. It would not necessarily involve physically separating amino acids, which is a separate process. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom gained a clear understanding of polypeptides rather than separating amino acids."}}
{"Q": "The minister appointed a representative for him to attend the meeting. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He turned to the assistants for explaination. (B) The representatives must be careful with his words since he should be responsible to his minister.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The representatives must be careful with his words since he should be responsible to his minister.\n\nExplanation: Since the minister appointed a representative to attend the meeting on his behalf, it is expected that the representative will act as a proxy for the minister and represent his views and opinions. Therefore, the representative must be careful with his words and actions as he is responsible to the minister and must ensure that his actions align with the minister's expectations. Option A is not a plausible answer as there is no indication that the minister needed an explanation from his assistants."}}
{"Q": "The doctor told him not to worry. There was basically no pathological change. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has met an archaeopteryx on his way home. (B) Einstein's father was detected with retinoblastoma.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The cause of the doctor's reassurance is not given in the question stem, but option B is a more plausible answer as it provides a medical condition that could have been a concern for the patient. Retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that can be hereditary, and if detected in a family member, it may increase the risk of developing the disease. Therefore, if the patient had a family history of retinoblastoma, the doctor's reassurance that there was no pathological change would be a relief. Option A, on the other hand, is not a plausible answer as meeting an archaeopteryx, which is an extinct bird, is impossible in the present day."}}
{"Q": "Tom looked at how does leadership get the achievement of results. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At last he learned it was through people. (B) At last he learned it was through money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. At last he learned it was through people.\nExplanation: Leadership is about inspiring and guiding people towards a common goal. While money can be a motivator, it is ultimately the people who drive the achievement of results. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom learned that leadership is about working with and through people to achieve success."}}
{"Q": "Tom has eaten a lot of grapefruit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom likes eating bananas. (B) His high blood pressure was cured without the help of drugs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. His high blood pressure was cured without the help of drugs.\nExplanation: Grapefruit is known to have properties that can help lower blood pressure. Therefore, it is plausible that Tom's high blood pressure was cured as a result of eating a lot of grapefruit. However, there is no direct correlation between Tom's grapefruit consumption and his liking for bananas, making option A less plausible."}}
{"Q": "The load divided by its drainage area is large. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This river is of high field. (B) The flood overwhelmed many dikes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This river is of high field.\n\nExplanation: A river's field refers to the amount of water it can carry per unit area. If the load (amount of sediment) divided by the drainage area is large, it means that the river is carrying a lot of sediment per unit area. This could be due to the river having a high field, meaning it has a large capacity to carry sediment. It is unlikely that the flood overwhelmed many dikes as this would result in a decrease in the drainage area, leading to a smaller load per drainage area."}}
{"Q": "She became a background singer in the chorus. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy was always crying. (B) Mary was a singer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Mary was a singer and likely helped or encouraged the person to become a background singer in the chorus. Option A, that Lucy was always crying, does not seem to be a logical reason for someone to become a background singer."}}
{"Q": "Whiskers are closely connected to the nervous system. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They are sensitive. (B) The clerk refused him on the grounds that he didn't have prescription from a psychiatrist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They are sensitive.\nExplanation: Whiskers, also known as vibrissae, have a rich nerve supply and are connected to sensory receptors in the skin. This allows animals to use their whiskers to detect changes in their environment, such as the presence of objects or movement of air currents. Therefore, whiskers are highly sensitive and play an important role in the sensory perception of animals."}}
{"Q": "The phenomenon of accretion happened. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists study the effect of induction on plant variation. (B) Tom rubbed two small pills together into one big pill.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Accretion is the process of gradual growth or increase in size by the accumulation of matter. Tom rubbing two small pills together into one big pill is a more plausible explanation for accretion than scientists studying the effect of induction on plant variation, as the latter has no direct connection to the concept of accretion."}}
{"Q": "Tom's heart is beating abnormally. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor insert a pacemaker for him. (B) The doctor measured his electrocardiogram.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The doctor measured his electrocardiogram.\nExplanation: When someone's heart is beating abnormally, one of the first steps a doctor will take is to measure their electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart and can help diagnose any abnormalities or irregularities in the heart's rhythm. Based on the results of the ECG, the doctor may then decide on further treatment options, such as medication or a pacemaker. However, inserting a pacemaker is not necessarily the first step in treating an abnormal heart rhythm, and would only be done if deemed necessary after further evaluation and testing."}}
{"Q": "Jane exposed her clothes to the sun. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The colour has faded. (B) The clothes are wet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The colour has faded.\nExplanation: When clothes are exposed to the sun for a prolonged period, the UV rays can cause the colour to fade. This is a common occurrence, especially with brightly coloured or dark fabrics. The sun's heat can also cause the fabric to become brittle and weaken over time. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid exposing clothes to direct sunlight for extended periods to prevent damage."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have discovered a polymer of sugar. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists say it is oligosaccharide. (B) Scientists say it is glycogen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Scientists say it is glycogen.\nExplanation: Glycogen is a polymer of glucose, which is a type of sugar. It is commonly found in animals and serves as a storage form of glucose. Therefore, it is more plausible that scientists would discover a polymer of glucose that is glycogen rather than oligosaccharide, which is a shorter chain of sugar molecules."}}
{"Q": "They found many food. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The beagles were hungry. (B) Humankind gathered food on trees and on ground at first.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The beagles were hungry.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the beagles found many food items, which implies that they were searching for food and came across a variety of options. Option (B) is not a plausible answer as it talks about humankind gathering food, which is not relevant to the context of the sentence. Therefore, option (A) is the more likely cause of the beagles finding many food items."}}
{"Q": "He had securities representing ownership shares of his company. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob is the manager of the company. (B) The hard-working staff got stocks of his company.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The hard-working staff got stocks of his company.\n\nExplanation: It is common for companies to offer stocks or securities to their employees as a form of compensation or incentive. This allows employees to have a stake in the company's success and can motivate them to work harder and contribute to the company's growth. Therefore, it is more plausible that the ownership shares were given to the staff rather than the manager, as it aligns with common business practices."}}
{"Q": "At night they set up tents to sleep. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Audrey and her friends take part in group trips. (B) The patients felt that their disease could not be cured.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Audrey and her friends set up tents to sleep suggests that they were on a group trip or camping trip. It is unlikely that patients who feel their disease cannot be cured would be setting up tents to sleep. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Everyone can be susceptible to other people or things. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The virus spreads widely. (B) Every human is a life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Every human is a life.\nExplanation: As human beings, we are social creatures and we interact with others on a daily basis. This interaction can lead to the spread of emotions, ideas, and even physical illnesses. We are all vulnerable to the influence of others and the environment around us. Therefore, it is important to be aware of our susceptibility and take necessary precautions to protect ourselves."}}
{"Q": "Usually girls showed better attitude than boys in learning English. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Those girl got higher ability in using English. (B) He noticed the shoots it produced one day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Those girls got higher ability in using English.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that girls showed better attitude in learning English, which implies that they were more motivated and engaged in the learning process. As a result, they were likely to have put in more effort and practice, leading to a higher level of proficiency in using English. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that those girls got higher ability in using English compared to boys who did not show the same level of attitude."}}
{"Q": "Radishes are planted near cole crops. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many flea beetles have been attracted. (B) They can accumulated on one side.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Many flea beetles have been attracted.\nExplanation: Radishes are known to repel certain pests, including flea beetles, which are a common pest of cole crops such as cabbage and broccoli. By planting radishes near cole crops, the radishes can attract the flea beetles away from the cole crops, reducing the damage they cause. Therefore, it is more plausible that many flea beetles have been attracted to the radishes rather than them accumulating on one side."}}
{"Q": "He was a monotheist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many altars have been set up in his courtyard. (B) He believes in only one god.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He believes in only one god.\nExplanation: If someone is a monotheist, it means they believe in only one god. This is a common characteristic of religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The setting up of altars in his courtyard would not be a logical result of being a monotheist, as the worship of multiple gods would be contradictory to this belief."}}
{"Q": "He cannot inhale air normally. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This patient has difficulty in breathing. (B) Lungs problems affected his respiratory system.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The statement suggests that the patient is having difficulty inhaling air normally, which indicates a problem with the respiratory system. Option B states that the problem is caused by lung problems affecting the respiratory system, which is a more plausible answer than option A, which is too general and does not provide a specific cause for the breathing difficulty. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause of the patient's breathing difficulty."}}
{"Q": "He suffered from the smallpox. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was in the hospital. (B) There was a virus spreading in the air of Tom's class.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There was a virus spreading in the air of Tom's class.\nExplanation: Smallpox is a highly contagious viral disease that spreads through respiratory droplets. It is unlikely that Tom would have contracted smallpox while in the hospital unless he was in close contact with someone who had the disease. On the other hand, if there was a virus spreading in the air of Tom's class, it is possible that he could have contracted smallpox from an infected classmate. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jessy was thinking whether to go for a trip. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She gave up in case of drastic lotteries. (B) She gave up in case of drastic consequences.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She gave up in case of drastic consequences.\nExplanation: Based on the given information, Jessy was considering going on a trip but was hesitant due to some potential negative outcome. Option B suggests that she ultimately decided not to go because of the possibility of drastic consequences. Option A, on the other hand, mentions \"drastic lotteries,\" which doesn't make much sense in this context. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor showed him samples of his Neuroendocrine cells of endodermal derivation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor looked at the gap synapse between the patient's neurons. (B) The patient didn't believe he got Carcinoids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The patient didn't believe he got Carcinoids.\nExplanation: The doctor showed the patient samples of his Neuroendocrine cells of endodermal derivation to convince him that he had Carcinoids. This suggests that the patient was in denial or disbelief about his diagnosis, and the doctor needed to provide concrete evidence to convince him. Option A is not relevant to the given scenario as it talks about gap synapses between neurons, which is not related to the diagnosis of Carcinoids."}}
{"Q": "They subdivide a whole year. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mating season finally ends. (B) There are four seasons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There are four seasons.\nExplanation: The subdivision of a whole year into four seasons is a natural occurrence caused by the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the sun. The changing position of the Earth in relation to the sun causes variations in temperature, weather patterns, and daylight hours, which are the defining characteristics of each season. Therefore, it is more plausible that the subdivision of a year into four seasons is due to natural phenomena rather than the end of a mating season."}}
{"Q": "He brought a lawsuit against the company. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His business followed the failure. (B) Jack and his boss had a resignation problem.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"He brought a lawsuit against the company,\" but it does not mention anything about Jack and his boss having a resignation problem. However, it does mention that \"his business followed the failure,\" which suggests that the cause of the lawsuit may have been related to the failure of his business. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The policeman didn't catch him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The stowaway was arrested. (B) The stowaway escaped by the boat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The stowaway escaped by the boat.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that the stowaway was able to evade the policeman by using the boat to escape. If the stowaway had been arrested, it would have been clear that the policeman had caught him. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely cause of the policeman's failure to catch the stowaway."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a fever. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are TIPs. (B) Doctors think Tom's fever is caused by infection.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Doctors think Tom's fever is caused by infection.\nExplanation: When someone has a fever, it is often a sign that their body is fighting off an infection. Therefore, it is more plausible that doctors would suspect an infection as the cause of Tom's fever rather than the unrelated fact that they are TIPs (which is not relevant to the situation)."}}
{"Q": "Scientists observe the difference between haploid and diploid cells. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They call this property covalence. (B) Scientists have discovered the process of mitosis in both.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Scientists have discovered the process of mitosis in both.\nExplanation: By observing the difference between haploid and diploid cells, scientists have discovered that both types of cells undergo the process of mitosis. Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in the production of two identical daughter cells. This process is essential for growth, repair, and maintenance of tissues in both haploid and diploid organisms. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer. Option (A) is incorrect because covalence is a property of chemical bonds, not cells."}}
{"Q": "They bought a chiller in a joint venture. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They did an experiment about aeration. (B) Students want to cool the hot water in a rapid way.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the students wanted to cool the hot water in a rapid way, hence the need for a chiller. An experiment about aeration does not necessarily require a chiller, and it is not clear how aeration would be related to the need for cooling hot water."}}
{"Q": "We don't know what oxalate is. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We ask institutes for help. (B) Our teacher tells us it is a by-product of digestion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If we don't know what oxalate is, the most plausible answer would be to ask institutes for help. This could include searching for information online, consulting medical or scientific journals, or reaching out to experts in the field. Relying solely on our teacher's explanation may not be sufficient, as they may not have the most up-to-date or accurate information on the topic."}}
{"Q": "I took my pet to see a vet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor was unmoved. (B) He diagnoised my pet with fever.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He diagnosed my pet with fever.\nExplanation: When taking a pet to see a vet, it is likely that the vet will examine the pet and make a diagnosis if there is an issue. Option (A) is less likely as it suggests the vet did not react or respond to the pet's condition, which is unlikely in a professional setting. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sam only keeps hens. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam's hens can lay eggs. (B) Sam's hens cannot lay eggs without roosters.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Sam's hens can lay eggs.\nExplanation: Hens are capable of laying eggs without the presence of roosters. While roosters are needed for fertilization and the production of chicks, hens can still lay unfertilized eggs on their own. Therefore, it is plausible that Sam's hens can lay eggs even without roosters."}}
{"Q": "Weevils were born. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is not too hot but a little wet at this time in summer. (B) A flu attacked this town.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Weevils are a type of beetle that thrive in warm and humid conditions. The fact that it is not too hot but a little wet in the summer provides the ideal environment for weevils to breed and lay eggs, leading to the birth of new weevils. A flu attacking the town would have no direct correlation to the birth of weevils."}}
{"Q": "Tom always touches his eyes with his dirty hands. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got eye irritation. (B) He has suffered the trachoma.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He got eye irritation.\nExplanation: Touching the eyes with dirty hands can introduce bacteria and other harmful substances into the eyes, leading to irritation and possibly infection. Trachoma is a specific type of bacterial infection that can be caused by poor hygiene, but it is not the only possible outcome of touching the eyes with dirty hands. Eye irritation is a more common and likely result."}}
{"Q": "He gets some concentrated phytoestrogens. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He processes flaxseeds. (B) He picks cucumbers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He processes flaxseeds.\nExplanation: Flaxseeds are known to be a rich source of phytoestrogens, specifically lignans. When flaxseeds are processed, such as by grinding or milling, the concentration of lignans increases, making it a more concentrated source of phytoestrogens. On the other hand, cucumbers are not known to contain significant amounts of phytoestrogens. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is an ecologist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has been the best student in the class with the highest skill level. (B) He acknowledges linear approaches.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Being an ecologist does not necessarily mean that Tom has been the best student in the class or has the highest skill level. However, it is plausible that as an ecologist, Tom acknowledges linear approaches, as this is a common concept in ecology when studying population growth or resource utilization."}}
{"Q": "We can see the green concrete paving of this rail. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Urban Construction Bureau has added a new railway here. (B) This streetcar girder rail is dyed green.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This streetcar girder rail is dyed green.\nExplanation: It is common for streetcar or light rail systems to use colored concrete or coatings on their rails to make them more visible to pedestrians and drivers. The green color of the concrete paving on this rail is likely a deliberate choice to make it more noticeable and increase safety. Option (A) is unlikely as it suggests a new railway was added, which would require significant construction and planning, and there is no evidence of such activity in the photo."}}
{"Q": "The conifers survived the winter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Coniferous trees have needles in winter. (B) The harsh winter finally ends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Coniferous trees have needles in winter.\nExplanation: Coniferous trees have adapted to survive harsh winter conditions by retaining their needles, which are able to photosynthesize and provide the tree with energy even in cold temperatures. This allows the tree to continue to grow and survive through the winter months. Therefore, the survival of the conifers can be attributed to their unique adaptation of retaining needles in winter."}}
{"Q": "Hydration comes from pure, clean water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The sewage is carried away efficiently. (B) We need to drink water to maintain proper hydration.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. We need to drink water to maintain proper hydration.\n\nExplanation: The statement implies that pure, clean water is necessary for hydration, which means that our bodies require water to function properly and maintain hydration levels. This is a well-known fact, as our bodies are made up of mostly water and require a certain amount of water intake to stay hydrated and healthy. The statement does not suggest anything about sewage or its efficient removal, so option A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The new waiter knew how to communicate with the guests. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The superior leader is responsible for teaching skills. (B) Different customers have different needs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The superior leader is responsible for teaching skills.\n\nExplanation: It is likely that the new waiter was trained by a superior leader who emphasized the importance of effective communication with guests. A good leader would provide training and guidance to their staff to ensure they have the necessary skills to meet the needs of different customers. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the new waiter's ability to communicate with guests is due to the training provided by their superior leader. Option B is not a likely cause as it does not explain how the waiter acquired the necessary communication skills."}}
{"Q": "Lisa had scorpionfish for lunch. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She got stuck in her throat by the bones of the scorpionfish. (B) Lisa eats the parfait in the refrigerator.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She got stuck in her throat by the bones of the scorpionfish.\nExplanation: Scorpionfish are known for having many small, sharp bones that can be difficult to remove. If Lisa did not properly remove the bones before eating the fish, it is possible that one could have become lodged in her throat, causing discomfort or even choking. Option B, on the other hand, is not related to the scorpionfish and seems like an unrelated event."}}
{"Q": "The teacher asked the students to choose a mammal with the same body heat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They studied the bodies of cockroaches. (B) One student chose lemmings.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) One student chose lemmings.\nExplanation: Since the teacher asked the students to choose a mammal with the same body heat, it is more plausible that one of the students would choose a mammal rather than studying the bodies of cockroaches, which are not mammals. Lemmings are a type of small rodent that are known for their high metabolic rate and body heat regulation, making them a suitable choice for this task."}}
{"Q": "He wants a feeding service. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He turned to his father. (B) He saved money at his best and bought it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He turned to his father.\nExplanation: Since the sentence does not mention anything about the person having enough money to buy a feeding service, it is more plausible that he turned to his father for help. It is common for people to seek help from their family members when they need something they cannot afford. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome. Option B is less likely because it assumes that the person had enough money to save and buy the feeding service, which is not mentioned in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "My mom tells me it is stigma. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I want to know the name of female reproductive structures in flowers. (B) I don't know what CM refers to.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I don't know what CM refers to. \nExplanation: The question mentions stigma, which is a term related to reproductive structures in flowers. Therefore, option (A) seems unrelated to the question. On the other hand, option (B) is more plausible as it suggests that the cause of something (stigma) is unknown or unclear (not knowing what CM refers to)."}}
{"Q": "I should concentrate on the writing of a time a place an era. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Product with good quality will sale well. (B) My research interest is about Literature.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of concentrating on the writing of a time, a place, or an era is likely due to the researcher's interest in literature. Literature often reflects the social, cultural, and historical context of the time and place in which it was written, making it important to understand the context in order to fully appreciate and analyze the work. Therefore, a researcher interested in literature would likely focus on the writing of a specific time, place, or era to gain a deeper understanding of the literary works produced during that period."}}
{"Q": "John wants to have a scientific study of the complex water systems of the Earth and help solve water problems. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided to major in malacology. (B) He chooses hydrology as his major.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: John's interest in studying the complex water systems of the Earth and solving water problems aligns with the field of hydrology, which focuses on the distribution, movement, and quality of water on Earth. Therefore, it is more plausible that John would choose hydrology as his major rather than malacology, which is the study of mollusks."}}
{"Q": "He was considered as one of the greatest hero in the history. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The killer gave John too much laxative. (B) Yuan Longping has made a great contribution to solving the problem of people's starving.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Yuan Longping is known as the \"Father of Hybrid Rice\" and has made significant contributions to solving the problem of people's starving by developing high-yield hybrid rice varieties. This has helped to increase food production and alleviate hunger in many parts of the world. Therefore, it is more plausible that his contributions to agriculture and food security have earned him the title of one of the greatest heroes in history. Option A, about the killer giving John too much laxative, is irrelevant and not related to the question."}}
{"Q": "He is able to control the riding rhythm well in horseback riding competitions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is a jockey who is controlling his weight recently. (B) He has good endurance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He has good endurance.\n\nExplanation: Good endurance is a key factor in controlling the riding rhythm in horseback riding competitions. It allows the rider to maintain a consistent pace and adjust to changes in terrain or obstacles. While being a jockey and controlling weight may also be important factors in horseback riding, they are not directly related to controlling the riding rhythm. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John decided to travel in the summer vacation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He left his hometown for Venice. (B) He followed some trails and found the way out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He left his hometown for Venice.\nExplanation: Since John decided to travel in the summer vacation, it is more plausible that he left his hometown to go to a different place, such as Venice. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that John was lost and had to find his way out, which is not necessarily related to his decision to travel."}}
{"Q": "He was sentenced to prison. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He surprisingly found that prisoners could read in the reading room and learn about the outside world through TV. (B) He surprisingly the life in rehab is tedious and depressing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person sentenced to prison would discover new things about prison life, such as the ability to read and learn about the outside world through the reading room and TV, rather than suddenly finding rehab life tedious and depressing."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought some artifacts in a store. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The store owner got it in a rural place. (B) The store owner said it was made by himself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the purchase of the artifacts and the store owner's claim about their origin. Option A is not directly related to the purchase and is not necessary information for the story."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to go to space. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He aspired to be an astronaut. (B) He aspired to be a calligrapher.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He aspired to be an astronaut.\nExplanation: It is logical to assume that if someone wants to go to space, they would aspire to be an astronaut or work in a related field such as aerospace engineering. Aspiring to be a calligrapher is not related to space travel and therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man  planned to make Tin  by himslef. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had to design the necessary components. (B) He found cassiterite, carbon and  furnace.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If the man planned to make tin by himself, it is more plausible that he would need to find the necessary materials and tools, rather than designing the components himself. Therefore, option B is a more likely outcome. Finding cassiterite (the ore from which tin is extracted), carbon (which is used to reduce the cassiterite to tin), and a furnace (to heat the materials) would be essential steps in the process of making tin."}}
{"Q": "Scientists extract substances from plasma. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientist discover crystals. (B) Scientists have extracted all kinds of substances.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Scientists have extracted all kinds of substances.\nExplanation: Plasma is the liquid part of blood that contains various substances such as proteins, hormones, and electrolytes. Scientists have been able to extract many of these substances from plasma, including albumin, immunoglobulins, and clotting factors. These extracted substances have been used for various medical purposes, such as treating immune deficiencies and blood clotting disorders. However, the extraction of substances from plasma does not necessarily lead to the discovery of crystals, as crystals are a separate phenomenon that may or may not be related to the substances extracted from plasma."}}
{"Q": "The structure of the soil has changed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He added a lot of Bacillus to the soil. (B) They dig to the subsoil.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They dig to the subsoil.\nExplanation: Digging to the subsoil can disrupt the natural structure of the soil, causing it to change. This can happen when the topsoil is removed or mixed with the subsoil, altering the soil's texture, composition, and nutrient content. Adding Bacillus to the soil can improve its structure, but it is unlikely to cause a significant change in the soil's structure on its own. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There is several little insects on the tree. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were hunted by the spider. (B) They were hungry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They were hunted by the spider.\nExplanation: Insects are a common prey for spiders, and it is likely that the presence of several little insects on the tree would attract a spider looking for food. Option B, that the insects were hungry, does not seem as likely as there is no indication in the question that the insects were behaving in a way that suggested hunger."}}
{"Q": "Time passed year after year. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The deflatation happened. (B) The wrinkles on my mother's face are getting more and more.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The wrinkles on my mother's face are getting more and more.\nExplanation: As time passes, people age and their physical appearance changes. Wrinkles are a common sign of aging, and they tend to become more prominent as a person gets older. Deflation, on the other hand, refers to a decrease in the general price level of goods and services in an economy, which may or may not happen over time depending on various economic factors. However, given the context of the sentence, it is more likely that the passage is referring to the natural process of aging rather than an economic phenomenon."}}
{"Q": "There are many states in the world. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) When he does experiments, he needs to freeze the biological specimens in advance for observation. (B) They all have their own political leaders.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The statement about there being many states in the world suggests that there are many different countries or political entities with their own distinct governments and leaders. This is a more plausible answer than option A, which seems unrelated to the initial statement."}}
{"Q": "This field benefited. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many people consider philosophy boring. (B) We added fertilizer to this field.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the field benefiting was the addition of fertilizer, which provided nutrients for the plants to grow and thrive. Choice A, which suggests that people's opinions about philosophy had something to do with the field's improvement, is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the topic."}}
{"Q": "He got immersed in articles about Ammonites. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He looked up information to find out about the extinct relatives of living elephants. (B) John was shocked by the existence of the extinct relatives of modern cephalopods.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: The mention of Ammonites being the extinct relatives of living elephants suggests that the person was researching prehistoric animals. Therefore, it is more plausible that he got immersed in articles about Ammonites because he was looking up information to find out about the extinct relatives of living elephants. Option B is less likely as it does not provide a clear reason for why John would be shocked by the existence of the extinct relatives of modern cephalopods."}}
{"Q": "Sam went to the psychotherapist. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam saw vesicles on her skin. (B) Sam suffered from depression.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Sam suffered from depression.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Sam went to the psychotherapist because she suffered from depression. Seeing vesicles on her skin would not necessarily lead someone to seek out a psychotherapist, whereas depression is a common reason for seeking therapy. Additionally, psychotherapy is a common treatment for depression."}}
{"Q": "A doctor is saving him from death by defibrillation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This old man was diagonsed with psychosis. (B) The young student is suffering a cardiac arrest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The young student is suffering a cardiac arrest.\nExplanation: Defibrillation is a medical procedure used to treat life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia, which can lead to cardiac arrest. Psychosis, on the other hand, is a mental disorder that affects a person's thoughts, emotions, and behavior, and is not typically treated with defibrillation. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom's car is always drawn by dendrites. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They fly away when Tom tries to approach. (B) Tom measured the length of the dendrites in order to measure the distance between his car and the dendrite.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is not possible for a car to be drawn by dendrites as dendrites are small branching extensions of nerve cells. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Tom used the dendrites as a reference point to measure the distance between his car and the dendrites. This is a more plausible answer as it is possible for someone to use a nearby object as a reference point for measurement."}}
{"Q": "Sherry is waiting for her train in the train station. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Coconut tree is a kind of palm tree. (B) Sherry is going to go Shanghai by train.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Sherry is waiting for her train in the train station because she is going to go to Shanghai by train. This is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the situation described in the question. Choice A, while true, is not relevant to the question and does not provide a reason for why Sherry is waiting for her train."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought a lot of mangoes and coconuts. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom buys imported tropical fruit every day. (B) The doctor advised Tom to eat more tropical fruits to supplement his vitamins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The doctor advised Tom to eat more tropical fruits to supplement his vitamins. This is a more plausible answer as it provides a specific reason for Tom's purchase of mangoes and coconuts. Choice A is not as likely as it suggests a daily habit of buying imported tropical fruit, which may not be feasible or affordable for everyone."}}
{"Q": "He had to bear their great vocal sounds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The worker in zoo lives with capybaras. (B) Tom had to gather the people.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The worker in zoo lives with capybaras.\nExplanation: Capybaras are known for their loud vocalizations, so it is plausible that the worker in the zoo had to bear their great vocal sounds due to living with them. Option B, which suggests that Tom had to gather people, does not provide any context or explanation for why he would have to bear great vocal sounds."}}
{"Q": "He bought a pair of shoes made of rubber. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to protect his ankles when he runs. (B) Jack needed some silicone rubber.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom wants to protect his ankles when he runs.\nExplanation: The fact that the shoes are made of rubber suggests that they are likely running shoes, as rubber is a common material used in the soles of athletic shoes. The mention of protecting his ankles also supports this idea, as running shoes often have ankle support features. On the other hand, option B is unlikely as silicone rubber is not typically used in shoes, and the sentence does not mention Jack needing it for any specific purpose."}}
{"Q": "Artificial snow is impossible in summer of Hong Kong. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Small soft white pieces of frozen water melt in hot weather. (B) Rainwater distribution decreases with the increase of mountain altitude.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Artificial snow is made by spraying water into the air and allowing it to freeze before it falls to the ground. However, in hot weather, small soft white pieces of frozen water, also known as snowflakes, will melt before they reach the ground. Therefore, it is impossible to create artificial snow in the summer of Hong Kong due to the high temperatures. Option B is not relevant to the question as it talks about rainwater distribution and mountain altitude, which are not related to the creation of artificial snow."}}
{"Q": "I saw him swallowing movement. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I noticed the stranger's spitting. (B) He stood under the trees.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I noticed the stranger's spitting.\nExplanation: If the person was seen swallowing repeatedly, it is more likely that they were spitting something out rather than standing under trees causing them to swallow. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Biologist stand out to protect these significant creatures. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bushbucks are favored by humans, especially hunters. (B) People in this city are destroying the lives of mollusks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Bushbucks are favored by humans, especially hunters. This is a more plausible answer as bushbucks are often hunted for their meat and hides, which puts them at risk of population decline. Biologists may be working to protect them through conservation efforts and education about the importance of preserving their populations. On the other hand, there is no mention of mollusks in the question, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Young kangaroo is placed in the pouch on the abdomen of the female. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mother kangaroo has too much milk. (B) Kangaroos are marsupials.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Kangaroos are marsupials.\n\nExplanation: Kangaroos are marsupials, which means that they give birth to relatively undeveloped young that continue to develop outside the womb, typically in a pouch on the mother's abdomen. This allows the young to continue to receive nourishment and protection while they develop further. Therefore, the placement of the young kangaroo in the pouch is a natural and necessary part of the kangaroo's reproductive process. Option A, that the mother kangaroo has too much milk, is not a plausible answer as it does not explain why the young kangaroo is placed in the pouch."}}
{"Q": "He wanted to have a more exciting track. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He pulls out the spines that emit venom. (B) He changed the type of track.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He changed the type of track.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the person would change the type of track to make it more exciting rather than pulling out spines that emit venom, which would be dangerous and unnecessary. Changing the type of track could involve adding more obstacles or increasing the speed or difficulty level, which would make it more exciting."}}
{"Q": "He buried some seeds in the flowerpot. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Flowers grew soon after. (B) Saguaros grew soon after.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Flowers grew soon after.\nExplanation: Since the seeds were buried in a flowerpot, it is more likely that flowers would grow from the seeds. Saguaros are a type of cactus that typically grow in arid regions and would not be expected to grow in a flowerpot. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They feed ducks every morning. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There live several girls. (B) There are two grey armadillos.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There live several girls.\nExplanation: The fact that there are several girls living there suggests that they may have taken on the responsibility of feeding the ducks as a daily routine or hobby. It is a more plausible explanation than the presence of two grey armadillos, which are not typically known for feeding ducks."}}
{"Q": "The sales team will provide different services according to the different needs of customers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The voltage of the electric field has changed. (B) Different customers have different needs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Different customers have different needs.\nExplanation: It is a well-known fact that customers have different requirements and preferences. Therefore, it is essential for the sales team to provide different services according to the specific needs of each customer. The voltage of the electric field has no relevance to this situation."}}
{"Q": "Tom works hard. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He became an accomplished oncologist. (B) He earns a lot of money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He earns a lot of money.\nExplanation: Working hard often leads to success and financial stability. While becoming an accomplished oncologist is a possible outcome of hard work, it is not necessarily the only or most common result. Earning a lot of money is a more plausible answer as it is a common measure of success and achievement in many fields."}}
{"Q": "The stagnant water in the garden was drained. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Water was storaged in a cistern. (B) The gardener opened the drain in the garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The gardener opened the drain in the garden.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly states that the gardener took action to drain the stagnant water by opening the drain in the garden. Option (A) suggests that the water was intentionally stored in a cistern, which does not explain why it was drained."}}
{"Q": "This girl look for the cookbook to help her. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This girl wants to know the detailed feature of this dish. (B) The octopi was hungry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the girl is looking for a cookbook suggests that she is trying to find a recipe or instructions on how to make a particular dish. This implies that she wants to know the detailed features of the dish, such as the ingredients, cooking time, and preparation method. On the other hand, the option B, which suggests that the octopi was hungry, is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any logical explanation for why the girl is looking for a cookbook."}}
{"Q": "He was shocked by his chemical deficiency. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The food Tom ate contained bacteria. (B) The patient with addiction watched the neuroscientist's lecture.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the food Tom ate contained bacteria that caused his chemical deficiency. Bacteria can produce toxins that can affect the body's chemical balance and cause various symptoms, including shock. On the other hand, there is no clear connection between watching a neuroscientist's lecture and developing a chemical deficiency. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of Tom's shock."}}
{"Q": "He can just see something clearly in a short distance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom turned on his flashlight. (B) Tom measured the energy of the lightening during a thunderstorm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom turned on his flashlight.\nExplanation: If Tom can see something clearly in a short distance, it means that there is enough light to illuminate the object. Option A states that Tom turned on his flashlight, which would provide the necessary light to see the object clearly. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the situation and does not provide any explanation for why Tom can see the object clearly. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mario wants some flavonoid to paint his shirt. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He releases some swallowtail butterflies. (B) He catches some swallowtail butterflies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He catches some swallowtail butterflies.\nExplanation: Flavonoids are a type of pigment found in plants, and they are commonly used as natural dyes. Swallowtail butterflies are known to feed on plants that contain flavonoids, so it is possible that Mario caught some butterflies in order to extract the flavonoids from their bodies to use as a dye for his shirt. Releasing the butterflies would not have helped him obtain the flavonoids he needed."}}
{"Q": "Tom's shoelaces were lost. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He went to the shop of footwear. (B) He went to buy caulk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He went to the shop of footwear.\nExplanation: If Tom lost his shoelaces, it is likely that he would need to replace them. The most logical place to do so would be at a shop that sells footwear. Option B, going to buy caulk, is not a plausible answer as it is not related to shoelaces."}}
{"Q": "Tom was an alcoholic. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom died. (B) He felt ashamed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He felt ashamed.\nExplanation: While alcoholism can lead to serious health problems and even death, it is not necessarily the only outcome. In this case, the question does not provide enough information to determine if Tom's alcoholism led to his death. However, it is likely that he experienced negative consequences such as strained relationships, financial difficulties, and feelings of shame or guilt. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it reflects a common emotional response to addiction."}}
{"Q": "Many anthropologist disagree with him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim holds the division of humankind. (B) Jack is a naturalist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Tim's belief in the division of humankind is a controversial and debated topic among anthropologists. Many disagree with his theory, which suggests that there are distinct biological and cultural differences between different races and ethnic groups. This idea has been criticized for promoting racism and essentialism, and for ignoring the complex social and historical factors that shape human diversity. Therefore, it is likely that the disagreement with Tim is due to his controversial and contested views on race and ethnicity."}}
{"Q": "Tim is a philosopher. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He studies the fundamental questions of everyday life. (B) He believes in non-hierarchial society.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: As a philosopher, Tim's area of study would be the fundamental questions of everyday life, such as the nature of reality, knowledge, ethics, and existence. While some philosophers may hold beliefs about societal structures, such as non-hierarchical societies, this is not necessarily a direct result of being a philosopher. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He found many words subject to shellfishes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is looking up the dictionary. (B) He caught a lungfish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom is looking up the dictionary. It is common for dictionaries to list words that are related to a specific topic or category, such as shellfish. Therefore, it is likely that Tom found many words related to shellfish while looking up definitions in a dictionary. On the other hand, catching a lungfish would not necessarily lead to finding many words related to shellfish."}}
{"Q": "The pistachio is infected with the disease. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It's cloudy today. (B) It has been raining and humid recently.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It has been raining and humid recently.\nExplanation: Pistachio trees are susceptible to fungal diseases, and high humidity and moisture provide ideal conditions for fungal growth and spread. Rain and humidity can also weaken the tree's immune system, making it more vulnerable to infections. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the pistachio's disease is the recent rainy and humid weather."}}
{"Q": "He found bring bulges in the flat disk-like spiral. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He looked at the center of the spiral of the star with Kepler telescope. (B) He looked at the center of the spiral of the tree with Kepler telescope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He looked at the center of the spiral of the star with Kepler telescope.\n\nExplanation: The Kepler telescope is designed to observe stars and their planetary systems. It is not capable of observing trees or any other non-celestial objects. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. The bulges in the flat disk-like spiral could be caused by the presence of planets or other celestial bodies orbiting the star, or by the gravitational influence of nearby stars."}}
{"Q": "The manager immediately found out which uses the best techniques. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The manager browsed only one of the proposals. (B) The manager compared several proposals received.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the manager immediately finding out which uses the best techniques is that they compared several proposals received. By comparing multiple proposals, the manager was able to identify which one used the best techniques. If the manager had only browsed one proposal, they would not have had a basis for comparison and would not have been able to determine which proposal used the best techniques."}}
{"Q": "He was diagnosed with Leptospirosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This little man abused inhalants in his life. (B) This boy was exposed to contaminated rat urine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This boy was exposed to contaminated rat urine.\nExplanation: Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that is commonly spread through contact with the urine of infected animals, particularly rats. It is unlikely that inhalant abuse would lead to this diagnosis, making option (B) the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was prepared to join the parade. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He walked to the bay. (B) Tom went to the street to join the parade.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom went to the street to join the parade.\nExplanation: Since Tom was prepared to join the parade, it is more likely that he would go to the street where the parade was taking place rather than walking to the bay, which is not mentioned in the context. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was punched and kicked before he died. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A student died in this dormitory. (B) Bob was killed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A student died in this dormitory.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible as it suggests that the victim may have been involved in a fight or altercation with another student, which resulted in him being punched and kicked before his death. On the other hand, option B is too vague and does not provide any context or explanation for the cause of the violence."}}
{"Q": "His parents moved to another house in another village. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ruhr took the puppy away from his mother. (B) Tom has sold the house.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The given sentence does not provide any information about Ruhr or a puppy. However, it clearly states that the parents moved to another house in another village. The most plausible reason for this would be that Tom, who is not mentioned in the sentence, sold the house. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack is bound to fail. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack tried to make his two terrapins reproroduce their child. (B) Jack tried to make his female terrapin reproroduce his child on her own.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is biologically impossible for a female terrapin to reproduce a child on her own without the presence of a male terrapin. Therefore, Jack's attempt to make his female terrapin reproduce on her own is not only implausible but also bound to fail."}}
{"Q": "The scientists found nothing but tarsiers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists want to find the animal with the largest eye among mammals relative to their body weight. (B) Scientists want to find the strongest kind of mammals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Scientists want to find the animal with the largest eye among mammals relative to their body weight.\nExplanation: Tarsiers are known for having the largest eyes relative to their body size among all mammals. Therefore, if scientists were specifically looking for an animal with this characteristic, it would make sense that they found nothing but tarsiers. Option B, on the other hand, is not a plausible explanation as strength is not a defining characteristic of tarsiers."}}
{"Q": "It can't be used any more. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The water flew from the community. (B) The uppermost shell of the earth is relatively brittle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The uppermost shell of the earth being relatively brittle is a more plausible cause for something not being able to be used anymore. This could refer to a variety of things such as a building or a piece of equipment that has become damaged or worn out due to the earth's crust being brittle and prone to shifting or cracking. On the other hand, the water flowing from a community may cause inconvenience or disruption, but it is unlikely to render something completely unusable."}}
{"Q": "He took in additional nutrients. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom ate a Broccolis for death. (B) Tom ate a Broccolis for vitamins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Tom took in additional nutrients because he ate broccoli for vitamins. Broccoli is a good source of vitamins such as vitamin C, vitamin K, and vitamin A. These vitamins are essential for maintaining good health and providing the body with the necessary nutrients to function properly. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom ate broccoli for its nutritional benefits rather than for death, making option B the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "Jenny's mother called this behavior a crime. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jenny wants to show her strength without restrictions. (B) Tom plucked the strings and the friction between the strings and the air produced vibrations.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Jenny's mother calling her behavior a crime suggests that Jenny did something wrong or illegal. Option A, where Jenny wants to show her strength without restrictions, is more likely to be the cause of her behavior being labeled as a crime. It implies that Jenny may have acted aggressively or recklessly, causing harm to someone or something, which could be considered a criminal offense. Option B, on the other hand, describes the scientific process of producing sound through a musical instrument, which is not related to criminal behavior."}}
{"Q": "One should preserve acids in a bottle with alkalis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Acids should not be preseved with chemicals of cheap prices. (B) Acids should not be preseved with chemicals of opposite features.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Acids should not be preserved with chemicals of opposite features.\n\nExplanation: Acids and alkalis are opposite in nature, with acids being proton donors and alkalis being proton acceptors. When acids are stored in a bottle with alkalis, they can react with each other, leading to the formation of salts and water. This can cause the bottle to become pressurized and potentially explode, leading to a hazardous situation. Therefore, it is important to store acids in a bottle with chemicals that have similar properties and not with alkalis. The choice (A) is not a plausible answer as the price of chemicals has no relation to their compatibility with acids."}}
{"Q": "Now he has a collection of more than 1, 000 toys. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom buys many toys each year. (B) The lonely man began to keep a cute pet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that \"he has a collection of more than 1,000 toys,\" which implies that the toys were accumulated over time. Option A states that \"Tom buys many toys each year,\" which is a plausible explanation for how he could have amassed such a large collection. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that the man began to keep a pet, which is not directly related to the collection of toys. Therefore, option A is a more likely cause of the man's toy collection."}}
{"Q": "He observed the variety in their size. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The photographer saw different species of jackals. (B) Tom observed the development of bulbils in lab.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The photographer saw different species of jackals.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"variety in their size,\" which suggests that the observation was made on a group of animals. Option A suggests that the animals observed were jackals of different species, which could explain the variation in size. Option B, on the other hand, talks about the development of bulbils in a lab, which is not related to the observation of animal size. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "We find that they emphasized characteristics. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We looked at a lot of photographs. (B) Scientists have done a research about nuclei.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that \"they emphasized characteristics,\" which implies that the observation was made through visual means. Looking at photographs is a plausible explanation for why characteristics were emphasized. On the other hand, the statement does not mention anything about nuclei research, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom always felt irregular heart beat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor told him that he had heart palpitations. (B) He was diagnosed with the palpitation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor told him that he had heart palpitations.\nExplanation: Heart palpitations are a common symptom of irregular heartbeats. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's doctor would diagnose him with heart palpitations rather than immediately diagnosing him with the condition itself. The doctor would likely conduct further tests to determine the cause of the palpitations and then diagnose Tom accordingly."}}
{"Q": "Tom needs to know the precise audio frequency. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He measured with the unit of megahertz. (B) He used nits.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He measured with the unit of megahertz.\n\nExplanation: Megahertz (MHz) is a unit of frequency commonly used to measure audio frequencies. It is a more plausible answer than using nits, which is a unit of luminance and has no relation to audio frequencies. Therefore, it is likely that Tom used megahertz to measure the precise audio frequency."}}
{"Q": "He found that neutralization occured. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The physicist gave an electron to a single charged ion. (B) The physicist gave a neutron to a single charged ion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The physicist gave an electron to a single charged ion.\nExplanation: Neutralization occurs when a positive ion gains one or more electrons from a negative ion, resulting in a neutral atom or molecule. In this case, the physicist gave an electron to a single charged ion, which caused the neutralization to occur. Giving a neutron to a single charged ion would not result in neutralization, as neutrons are neutral particles and do not affect the charge of an ion."}}
{"Q": "Lili will choose a branch of systematics to continue her study. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She chooses taxonomy. (B) The water splashed wet people nearby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She chooses taxonomy.\nExplanation: The question states that Lili will choose a branch of systematics to continue her study. Therefore, it is more plausible that she would choose a specific branch, such as taxonomy, rather than something unrelated like water splashing on people nearby."}}
{"Q": "Many houses are equipped with heaters. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The result is a lot of gas savings. (B) The purpose of warming up has been achieved.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The purpose of warming up has been achieved.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that many houses are equipped with heaters, which implies that the purpose of warming up the house during cold weather has been achieved. The statement does not provide any information about gas savings, so option A cannot be considered a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They have to study for diffent goals of the lessons. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Students listen to different lessons every day. (B) They have to make designs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Students listen to different lessons every day.\nExplanation: It is common for students to have different subjects or topics to study each day, which may have different goals or objectives. For example, they may have to study math one day and English the next, each with its own set of learning outcomes. This is a normal part of the curriculum and educational system, and does not necessarily have anything to do with making designs. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lilia has a gift for singing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Other ladies are jealous. (B) Although she has not received vocal training, her singing are very skilled.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Although she has not received vocal training, her singing are very skilled.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Lilia's gift for singing. It suggests that Lilia has a natural talent for singing, which is why she is skilled even without formal training. The other option, that other ladies are jealous, seems less likely as it does not necessarily follow from Lilia's gift for singing."}}
{"Q": "Peter put the mallard in the lake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Its shape ranges from highly irregular to sphere. (B) The mallard swam to the middle of the lake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The mallard swam to the middle of the lake.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it follows the natural behavior of mallards, which are known to be water birds and are capable of swimming. Therefore, it is likely that when Peter put the mallard in the lake, it would have swum to the middle of the lake, where it could find food and shelter. Choice (A) is not a plausible answer because it does not make sense in the context of the sentence and is not related to the behavior of mallards."}}
{"Q": "Tom believes in chemiluminescence. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom saw the production of light through a chemical reaction. (B) Tom knows how to apply physical chemical principles to biological systems.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Tom's belief in chemiluminescence is likely due to him witnessing the production of light through a chemical reaction. Chemiluminescence is a phenomenon where light is emitted as a result of a chemical reaction, and it is commonly observed in nature (e.g. fireflies) and in laboratory experiments. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's belief is based on direct observation rather than his knowledge of physical chemical principles."}}
{"Q": "Her mother always buys minnows. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary likes animals with thick brown fur. (B) Mary likes eating fish very much.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Mary's mother buys minnows because Mary likes eating fish very much. The fact that her mother always buys minnows suggests that they are a regular part of their diet. The statement about Mary liking animals with thick brown fur is irrelevant and does not provide any explanation for why her mother buys minnows."}}
{"Q": "The docter suggested Phytotherapy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom received treatment using plant products. (B) He applied a design for specific use.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom received treatment using plant products.\nExplanation: Phytotherapy is a form of alternative medicine that uses plant extracts and herbal preparations to treat various health conditions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor suggested using plant products for Tom's treatment rather than a design for specific use."}}
{"Q": "He have studied al extraterrestrial objects. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom studies physics. (B) Tom is an expert studying astronomy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The statement mentions that Tom has studied extraterrestrial objects, which is a topic that falls under the field of astronomy. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom is an expert studying astronomy rather than physics."}}
{"Q": "Many patients were given medication. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Some of them had allergic reactions. (B) The medicine affected the aggregate of lymph nodules.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Allergic reactions are a common side effect of medication and can occur in some patients. On the other hand, the effect of medication on the aggregate of lymph nodules is not a common or expected side effect, making option B less plausible."}}
{"Q": "He performs his resposibility with the help of magnetometers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The phycist is responsible for detecting trapped particles around the planet. (B) The phycist is responsible for detecting arbit of the planet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Magnetometers are instruments used to measure magnetic fields. Physicists often use magnetometers to detect trapped particles around planets, such as the Van Allen radiation belts around Earth. Therefore, choice A is a more plausible answer as it aligns with the use of magnetometers in detecting trapped particles. Choice B, on the other hand, does not make much sense as \"arbit of the planet\" is not a commonly used term in physics or astronomy."}}
{"Q": "We cannogt get clean water from those underground reservoirs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Aquifers were mostly clean. (B) The Aquifers were mostly pollution.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The Aquifers were mostly pollution.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that clean water cannot be obtained from underground reservoirs, which indicates that the water in the aquifers is contaminated. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the aquifers were mostly polluted, leading to the inability to obtain clean water. Option (A) is unlikely as it contradicts the statement's premise."}}
{"Q": "Monkeys are particularly abundant in the forests of this habitat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They use their nema-tocysts to capyure prey. (B) The population of monkey is high.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The population of monkey is high.\nExplanation: When a particular species is abundant in a habitat, it usually means that the conditions in that habitat are favorable for their survival and reproduction. In this case, the abundance of monkeys in the forest suggests that there is plenty of food, water, and shelter available for them. As a result, the population of monkeys is likely to be high. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as nema-tocysts are stinging cells found in some species of cnidarians and not in monkeys."}}
{"Q": "Electricity was conducted to the water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The electric wires fell into the water. (B) This experiment requires a general solvent that can dissolve many substances in nature.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible cause of electricity being conducted to the water is that the electric wires fell into the water, creating a path for the electricity to flow through the water. This is a common scenario in which electricity can be conducted to water, and it is important to be cautious around electrical equipment near water to prevent accidents. Choice B is not relevant to the question and does not provide a plausible explanation for the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "The radiolarian was observed to be much bigger. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There samples of radiolarian and dinausour teeth were placed under the microscope. (B) There samples of radiolarian and protozoan were placed under the microscope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The comparison of radiolarian size would be more plausible if it was compared to another microorganism, such as a protozoan, rather than a dinosaur tooth. Therefore, choice B is the more likely option."}}
{"Q": "It has been rainy most of the year and the soil is very wet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Muskmelons are not growing well. (B) The water seeps down into the soil and the soil becomes moist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Muskmelons are not growing well.\nExplanation: Muskmelons require well-drained soil and too much moisture can lead to root rot and other diseases. The excessive rain and wet soil may have caused poor growth and development of muskmelons."}}
{"Q": "His serious condition needed immediate medical treatment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jerry fainted with a shock. (B) My father has mild to moderate hypertension.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can lead to serious health complications if left untreated. It can cause damage to the heart, blood vessels, and other organs, and can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the serious condition requiring immediate medical treatment was due to the father's hypertension rather than Jerry fainting with a shock, which is not specified or explained further."}}
{"Q": "He is very pity for this man. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The faithful christian saw Charity. (B) He met a blind man.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that he met a blind man. Feeling pity for someone is a common reaction when encountering someone with a disability or in a difficult situation. Seeing charity may also elicit feelings of compassion, but it is not as clear-cut as encountering a blind man."}}
{"Q": "The chemist added many reagents to the two enantiomers respectively. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) All reagents proved the identical chemical properties of the enantiomers except the optically active reagents. (B) The former has only one cotyledon, while the latter has two cotyledons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and have identical physical and chemical properties except for their interaction with polarized light. Therefore, all reagents should prove the identical chemical properties of the enantiomers except the optically active reagents, which will show different reactions due to their different spatial arrangements. Option B is not relevant to the question and describes the difference between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants."}}
{"Q": "Linda's father is a builder. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Linda's house is built by her father. (B) His father said grain can be used to make food, sell money, and even make decorations.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more likely that Linda's father built her house as he is a builder. The second option about grain seems unrelated to the fact that Linda's father is a builder."}}
{"Q": "Few people can eliminate their universal human traits in their experience. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor prescribed the methamphetamine immediately. (B) Most people seems to have the trait of ethnocentrism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that despite differences in culture and upbringing, people still share common human traits. One such trait is ethnocentrism, which is the tendency to view one's own culture as superior to others. This is a plausible answer as it aligns with the idea that universal human traits are difficult to eliminate and can manifest in various ways. The statement does not provide any context for the prescription of methamphetamine, making option A an unlikely answer."}}
{"Q": "The size of its antlers has also changed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The male elk gradually grew up. (B) The living environment of lleopards has changed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The male elk gradually grew up.\nExplanation: The size of antlers in male elk is directly related to their age and maturity. As male elk grow older, their antlers tend to become larger and more complex. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the change in antler size is due to the male elk gradually growing up rather than the living environment of leopards changing."}}
{"Q": "He first studied tulips. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted some flowers to decorate his bedroom. (B) He wanted to study the flowers of the lily family.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He wanted to study the flowers of the lily family.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because tulips belong to the lily family, and it would make sense for someone interested in studying this family of flowers to start with tulips. Option A, on the other hand, seems less likely as a reason for someone to study a particular type of flower."}}
{"Q": "The teacher introduced transposition to Czech. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Czech asked the teacher if there were other examples of non-homologous recombination. (B) The teacher would introduce geometric shapes to students.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Czech asked the teacher if there were other examples of non-homologous recombination.\n\nExplanation: The introduction of transposition to Czech was a result of Czech's inquiry about non-homologous recombination. The teacher likely saw this as an opportunity to expand Czech's knowledge on the topic and introduce a new concept. The introduction of geometric shapes to students is not related to the topic of non-homologous recombination and therefore is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They weighed a carabao. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The scale shows a few ounces. (B) The scale showed that it was 300kg.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The scale showed that it was 300kg.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because carabaos are large animals and can weigh up to 600-800kg. Therefore, it is more likely that the scale would show a weight closer to 300kg rather than just a few ounces."}}
{"Q": "They shouldn't be exposed to common eradication chemicals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Snails are invertebrates. (B) The security inks should be preserved properly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The security inks should be preserved properly.\nExplanation: The statement is about not exposing something to common eradication chemicals, which implies that the thing being referred to is sensitive to such chemicals. Since the statement does not mention anything about snails or invertebrates, option A is not a plausible answer. On the other hand, option B suggests that the cause of concern is the preservation of security inks, which are often used to prevent counterfeiting of important documents or products. These inks may contain chemicals that can be harmful to the environment or human health if not handled properly, hence the need to avoid exposing them to common eradication chemicals."}}
{"Q": "There was one part of the intestine folds in on itself in this patient. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He saw that it was a digestive sac with two openings. (B) The doctor thought he had the intussusception.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The doctor thought he had the intussusception.\nExplanation: Intussusception is a medical condition where one part of the intestine folds in on itself, causing a blockage. This can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stools. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor suspected intussusception as a result of the intestinal fold, rather than the patient suddenly seeing a digestive sac with two openings."}}
{"Q": "I smelt fine flavour. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I cooked the flesh in the kitchen. (B) I sniffed the basil.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: The statement mentions \"cooked the flesh in the kitchen,\" which suggests that the fine flavor was likely caused by cooking food. On the other hand, sniffing basil may produce a pleasant aroma, but it is unlikely to cause a fine flavor in the sense of taste. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The skippers drank the nectar of various flowering plants. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The booming flowers were full of nectar. (B) The skippers are going to look for food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The booming flowers were full of nectar.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the skippers drank the nectar of various flowering plants. This suggests that the flowers were producing a lot of nectar, which is a common occurrence during the blooming season. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it provides a logical reason for the skippers to drink the nectar. Option B is not a valid explanation as it simply restates the fact that the skippers were looking for food, without explaining why they chose to drink nectar from flowering plants."}}
{"Q": "The farmer had a harvest on potatoes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The farmer fertilized the potatoes. (B) The farmer mates his female ox with another male ox.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The farmer fertilized the potatoes.\nExplanation: Fertilizing the potatoes is a common agricultural practice that helps to provide the necessary nutrients for the plants to grow and produce a good harvest. Mating a female ox with another male ox has nothing to do with potato harvest and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tracy's hiuse is in fire. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fireworkers took use of macrozamia. (B) They have found them in legumes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The fireworkers took use of macrozamia.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the fireworkers used macrozamia, which is a type of plant that can be used as a fire retardant, to help put out the fire in Tracy's house. Option B, which mentions finding legumes, does not seem relevant to the situation and does not provide a clear explanation of what happened as a result of the fire."}}
{"Q": "John is an experienced thief. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is good at catching mice and other animals. (B) He has stolen something.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He has stolen something.\nExplanation: The statement clearly states that John is an experienced thief, which implies that he has stolen something in the past. Option A, which suggests that he is good at catching mice and other animals, is not related to the given information and seems irrelevant. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom doesn't know a few words. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He looked up the dictionary. (B) He can't express himself clearly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He can't express himself clearly.\nExplanation: If Tom doesn't know a few words, he may struggle to find the right words to express himself clearly. This can lead to miscommunication and difficulty in conveying his thoughts and ideas effectively. While looking up the dictionary may help him learn the meanings of the words, it may not necessarily improve his ability to express himself in the moment."}}
{"Q": "I sent out bullets of different sizes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I used pea seeds as the bullets of my catapult. (B) My husband taught me shotting.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Using pea seeds as bullets of a catapult would result in bullets of different sizes because the seeds would vary in size. This is a plausible explanation for the situation described in the question. On the other hand, the second choice, \"My husband taught me shotting,\" does not provide a clear reason for why the bullets would be of different sizes."}}
{"Q": "The police department mobilized all its officers to investigate the case. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A serious criminal case has happened recently. (B) He got a bad cold.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The use of the word \"mobilized\" suggests that the situation is urgent and requires immediate action. Additionally, the fact that \"all\" officers were mobilized indicates that this is a significant event. Therefore, it is more likely that a serious criminal case has occurred rather than someone getting a bad cold."}}
{"Q": "He proves the function of vitality. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bell has a strong viability. (B) Tom's meristem is more sound than others.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that someone (presumably Bell) proves the function of vitality, which implies that they have a strong viability. Viability refers to the ability of an organism to survive and thrive, which is closely related to vitality. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer than option B, which talks about Tom's meristem (a plant tissue) and does not directly relate to the function of vitality."}}
{"Q": "He has a lot of experience in mountaineering. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He gave a lot of advice to the climbers. (B) He tried many things that he had never experienced before.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that someone with a lot of experience in mountaineering would give advice to other climbers rather than trying new things they have never experienced before. Experience in mountaineering would give someone knowledge and skills that they could share with others to help them succeed in their own climbs."}}
{"Q": "He made me a rattle. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My grandpa attached the hard hollow segments loosely. (B) He touches people's bodies without their agreement.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. My grandpa attached the hard hollow segments loosely.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"He made me a rattle,\" which implies that the person being referred to created a rattle for the speaker. The cause of this action is given in option A, which states that the speaker's grandpa attached the hard hollow segments loosely. Option B is not related to the sentence and is therefore an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The rats under investigation showed ischemic renal injury. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Teachers provided them with enations from rats. (B) They were injected with Polymerase to alleviate the symptom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They were injected with Polymerase to alleviate the symptom.\nExplanation: Ischemic renal injury is a condition where the kidneys do not receive enough blood flow, leading to damage and dysfunction. Polymerase is not a treatment for this condition, but there are medications and interventions that can help alleviate the symptoms and improve kidney function. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not relevant to the question and does not provide any explanation for the outcome of the ischemic renal injury."}}
{"Q": "The child eats cereals every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is healthy. (B) He was healthy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He is healthy.\nExplanation: Eating cereals every day is a healthy habit as it provides essential nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that the child is healthy as a result of this habit. However, it is important to note that other factors like overall diet, exercise, and genetics also play a role in determining one's health."}}
{"Q": "People there have no literacy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They can not understand the words on paper or wirte any words. (B) They can not write but they can read papers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They can not understand the words on paper or write any words.\n\nExplanation: Literacy refers to the ability to read and write. If people have no literacy, it means they cannot read or write. Therefore, they would not be able to understand the words on paper or write any words themselves. Option B is not plausible because if someone cannot write, it is unlikely that they would be able to read papers as well."}}
{"Q": "The docter said that was just after image. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack said he could see some spots in his field of vision. (B) The saint looked up to physical manifestation of deity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: After images are a common phenomenon that occurs when the eyes continue to see an image even after it has been removed. This can happen when the eyes are exposed to bright lights or when they are fatigued. Jack's complaint of seeing spots in his field of vision is consistent with this explanation, while the physical manifestation of a deity is not a scientifically recognized cause of after images. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is planning to rob the bank. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is always answering the phone. (B) Tom needs money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom needs money.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it provides a clear motive for Tom's plan to rob the bank. If Tom is in dire need of money, he may see robbing a bank as a quick solution to his financial problems. On the other hand, choice A (Tom is always answering the phone) does not provide any logical connection to Tom's plan to rob a bank."}}
{"Q": "Tony uses his toothbrush twice a day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tony's teeth are very healthy. (B) The minister's response is expected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tony's teeth are very healthy.\nExplanation: Brushing teeth twice a day is a recommended dental hygiene practice that helps to remove plaque and prevent tooth decay and gum disease. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that Tony's teeth are healthy as a result of his regular brushing routine. Option B is not related to the given information and is an irrelevant response."}}
{"Q": "The worker fainted for having food containing Terbium. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor gave him an injection of tranquilizer. (B) He was diagnoised as a  moderately toxic state.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was diagnosed as a moderately toxic state.\nExplanation: Terbium is a rare earth metal that can be toxic if ingested in large amounts. Symptoms of terbium toxicity include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and muscle weakness. Fainting can also be a symptom of terbium toxicity. Therefore, it is likely that the worker was diagnosed as being in a moderately toxic state due to the terbium in the food. It is unlikely that a doctor would give a tranquilizer injection for terbium toxicity."}}
{"Q": "This dish has a strong aroma. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This dish is steamed. (B) This dish is heavily spiced.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This dish is heavily spiced.\nExplanation: Spices are known to have strong aromas and can heavily influence the scent of a dish. Steaming a dish may not necessarily result in a strong aroma, unless the ingredients used in the dish have a strong scent themselves. Therefore, it is more plausible that the strong aroma in this dish is due to the heavy use of spices."}}
{"Q": "He found many levels overlapped like petals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is interested in the stems which are eusteles. (B) Tom stared at the nasturtium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom is interested in the stems which are eusteles.\nExplanation: Eusteles are a type of stem structure found in certain plants, including nasturtiums. They consist of a central cylinder of vascular tissue surrounded by layers of parenchyma cells. This structure can cause the levels of the stem to overlap like petals, as described in the sentence. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's interest in eusteles caused him to notice this overlapping pattern, rather than simply staring at the nasturtium."}}
{"Q": "Fox and rabbit in this stroy are in the place of people. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This story belongs to a fable. (B) It is evening.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The use of animals as characters in a story is a common feature of fables, which are stories that convey a moral lesson. By using animals instead of people, the story becomes more relatable and engaging for readers, and the moral lesson is often easier to understand and remember. Therefore, it is more plausible that the reason for using a fox and a rabbit in this story is because it belongs to the genre of fables."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought medicine for sties. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bacteria on Tom's hand infected tear ducts. (B) The pure water on Tom's hand infected tear ducts.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The bacteria on Tom's hand infected tear ducts.\n\nExplanation: Sties are usually caused by a bacterial infection of the oil glands in the eyelids. It is unlikely that pure water would cause an infection. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor found that her eye's clear lens to become cloudy blocking light. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boss is on the phone with the manager. (B) She got a cataract.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She got a cataract.\nExplanation: A cataract is a common condition where the clear lens of the eye becomes cloudy, leading to vision problems. It is a natural part of aging but can also be caused by other factors such as injury, certain medications, and medical conditions like diabetes. The symptoms of cataracts include blurry vision, sensitivity to light, and difficulty seeing at night. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial one. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor found a cataract as the cause of the cloudy lens rather than the boss being on the phone with the manager."}}
{"Q": "This poor girl has suffered from leukemia. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Basophils cause some allergic diseases. (B) The number of basophils in this poor girl is outside the bounds of normality.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, causing an abnormal increase in the number of white blood cells, including basophils. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the number of basophils in this poor girl is outside the bounds of normality, leading to the development of leukemia. Option A is not related to the cause of leukemia."}}
{"Q": "Usually the marble-like lumps of tissue of these patients are harmless. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Part of the nutrients in the patient's body were depleted. (B) Many patients with fibroadenomas come for treatment in this hospital.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Fibroadenomas are benign tumors that develop in the breast tissue. They are not caused by a high prevalence of patients with fibroadenomas coming to the hospital, but rather by hormonal changes in the body. These hormonal changes can be caused by a variety of factors, including fluctuations in estrogen levels, which can occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Nutrient depletion is not a known cause of fibroadenomas."}}
{"Q": "Mary and her cow are pregnant in the same month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After nine months, she and her cow will give birth to babies. (B) After one month, she will give birth to babies but not her cow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. After nine months, she and her cow will give birth to babies.\nExplanation: It is biologically impossible for a human and a cow to give birth at the same time or after one month. The gestation period for a human is around nine months, while for a cow, it is around nine and a half months. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that after nine months, both Mary and her cow will give birth to their respective babies."}}
{"Q": "He bought an avocado. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bought a booklet. (B) His mother asked him to buy a green vegetable.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His mother asked him to buy a green vegetable.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because avocados are commonly considered a type of green vegetable and it is likely that the mother specifically requested a green vegetable. Option (A) is not a likely cause for buying an avocado as it is not related to the purchase of a food item."}}
{"Q": "Telecommuning is widely employed by many companies due to the outbreak of epidemic. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People stay at home working and communicating with colleagues. (B) People prefer to work in companies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. People stay at home working and communicating with colleagues.\n\nExplanation: Due to the outbreak of epidemic, many companies have implemented telecommuting as a way to continue business operations while keeping employees safe. This has resulted in people staying at home and working remotely, communicating with colleagues through various online platforms. As a result, there has been a significant increase in the use of video conferencing, instant messaging, and other communication tools. This has allowed companies to maintain productivity while also reducing the risk of spreading the virus. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They found that it produced the lactase. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor monitored the human body. (B) The researcher observed that compound leaves fall from the trees.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor monitored the human body.\nExplanation: The production of lactase is a biological process that occurs within the human body. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor monitored the human body to determine the cause of lactase production rather than the researcher observing compound leaves falling from trees, which is unrelated to lactase production."}}
{"Q": "Mary was one of the runner this time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her face looks not as red as she just started jogging. (B) Mary participated in km tme trials.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her face looks not as red as she just started jogging.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is a common physical response to exercise. As the body becomes accustomed to physical activity, the blood vessels dilate and the body becomes more efficient at delivering oxygen to the muscles. This can result in a decrease in the redness of the face during exercise. Option B is not as likely because it introduces new information about km time trials that is not mentioned in the question stem."}}
{"Q": "Tom hopes to build up his physique. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He drinks a lot of probiotic juice. (B) He exercised for a long time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom would build up his physique by exercising for a long time rather than drinking a lot of probiotic juice. Exercise is a well-known way to build muscle and improve overall physical fitness, while probiotic juice may have some health benefits but is not directly linked to building muscle."}}
{"Q": "Susan took some doxycycline. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She became more sensitive to the smell of flowers after a few hours. (B) She became more sensitive to the stimulation of the sun after a few hours.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She became more sensitive to the smell of flowers after a few hours.\nExplanation: Doxycycline is an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections. It works by inhibiting the growth and spread of bacteria. It does not have any known effects on sensitivity to sunlight or other environmental stimuli. However, some people have reported increased sensitivity to smells after taking doxycycline. This is likely due to the drug's effect on the body's immune system and its ability to fight off infections. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He expressed himself through dance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is a dancer. (B) Mike wanted to feel what it felt like to move through the air.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom is a dancer.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"he expressed himself through dance,\" which implies that the person in question has a background in dance. Therefore, option A, which states that \"Tom is a dancer,\" is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests that Mike wanted to experience a physical sensation."}}
{"Q": "Tom is trying to make a plywood. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got some lancelets. (B) He is cutting a thin continous layer of wood off a log as it is spins around.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Making plywood involves cutting a thin continuous layer of wood off a log as it spins around. Choice A, getting some lancelets, is not related to the process of making plywood."}}
{"Q": "The man deals with sales. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Meeting people is part of his job. (B) He is part of the market.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Meeting people is part of his job.\nExplanation: Since the man deals with sales, it is likely that he has to interact with potential customers and clients in order to sell products or services. Therefore, meeting people is a necessary part of his job. Option B, on the other hand, is not necessarily true as being part of the market could refer to anyone who is a consumer or potential buyer, not just someone who works in sales."}}
{"Q": "Tom's gas cooker won't work. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His disease deteriorate slowly but continuously. (B) He started the fire with a piece of paper.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: If Tom's gas cooker won't work, it means he won't be able to cook his food properly. Option A about his disease deteriorating slowly but continuously is not related to the gas cooker not working. Option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Tom may have tried to start the fire with a piece of paper, which is not a safe or effective way to start a gas cooker."}}
{"Q": "This area is affected by the drought. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Why there are little seagrasses here? (B) A long period passes without substantial rainfall in this area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) A long period passes without substantial rainfall in this area.\nExplanation: Drought is defined as a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water. Therefore, the lack of rainfall is the most plausible cause of the drought in this area. The absence of seagrasses may be a consequence of the drought, as they require water to grow, but it is not the root cause."}}
{"Q": "The clothes of this brand sell well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The clothes of this brand are of good quality. (B) Owls have good night vision.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The clothes of this brand are of good quality.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the clothes of this brand sell well, which implies that customers are satisfied with the product. The most plausible reason for this satisfaction is that the clothes are of good quality. Customers are more likely to buy products that are durable, comfortable, and stylish, which are all characteristics of high-quality clothing. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the quality of the clothes is the cause of their success in the market. Choice B is irrelevant and has no connection to the statement."}}
{"Q": "He said he saw a hellhound running on the street. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I knew he told a lie. (B) I believed what he said.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I believed what he said.\nExplanation: As an AI language model, I cannot determine the credibility of the claim that the person saw a hellhound running on the street. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the listener believed what the person said. It is possible that the person actually saw a large dog or a wild animal that resembled a hellhound, or they may have been mistaken or exaggerating. Without further evidence, it is difficult to determine the truth of the claim."}}
{"Q": "Tom was eating the muskmelon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He felt the musk smell. (B) He felt thirsty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He felt thirsty.\nExplanation: Muskmelon is a fruit with high water content, and consuming it can lead to increased thirst. While it is possible that Tom may have also smelled the musk scent of the fruit, feeling thirsty is a more likely and common result of eating muskmelon."}}
{"Q": "Tom got some zooids. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The zookeeper fed them with water. (B) He uses them for tentacles research.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom would use the zooids for tentacles research, as zooids are small, colonial animals that are often studied for their unique abilities and structures. It is unlikely that a zookeeper would feed zooids with water, as they are not typically kept in zoos or aquariums."}}
{"Q": "Tom relinquished his citizenship of his motherland. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom became a citizen of another country. (B) Conflicts between the natives and the immigrants increased.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom became a citizen of another country.\nExplanation: When someone relinquishes their citizenship of a country, it means they are renouncing their legal ties and obligations to that country. This does not necessarily mean that conflicts between natives and immigrants will increase. Instead, Tom may have become a citizen of another country, or he may have become stateless if he did not acquire citizenship elsewhere."}}
{"Q": "They dissected the ovaries in their anatomy class. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They increased the size of the class. (B) By mistake, they dissected the kidney next to it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. By mistake, they dissected the kidney next to it.\nExplanation: Dissecting the ovaries in an anatomy class would not increase the size of the class. However, it is possible that the students accidentally dissected the kidney next to the ovaries, as they are located in close proximity to each other in the human body. This would be a more plausible outcome of the dissection."}}
{"Q": "These strangers were vile intruders. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These strangers invaded the farmers’ home. (B) These kids were playing in the park.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) These strangers invaded the farmers’ home.\nExplanation: The word \"intruders\" implies that these strangers were not welcome and had entered a space without permission. The use of the word \"vile\" suggests that their actions were unpleasant or harmful. Therefore, it is more plausible that these strangers invaded the farmers' home rather than innocent kids playing in a park."}}
{"Q": "We saw Vegetation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They did an experiment about aeration. (B) We came to the boundary of the wildlife habitat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. We came to the boundary of the wildlife habitat.\nExplanation: Vegetation is commonly found in wildlife habitats, as it provides food and shelter for animals. Therefore, it is more plausible that the presence of vegetation was due to us reaching the boundary of a wildlife habitat rather than an experiment about aeration."}}
{"Q": "The adhesives producing factory forgot to add rubber silicone acrylic into the its new products. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These products didn't function as they used to do. (B) Tom goes to a chemist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. These products didn't function as they used to do.\nExplanation: Rubber silicone acrylic is an important component in adhesives as it provides flexibility and durability. Without it, the adhesives may not bond properly or may become brittle and break easily. Therefore, the products would not function as they were intended to. Option B, where Tom goes to a chemist, is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the missing component in the adhesives."}}
{"Q": "This habitat has been occupied by them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Hedgehogs were rampant in this mountain. (B) There are a lot of donkeys in that area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Hedgehogs were rampant in this mountain.\nExplanation: Hedgehogs are known to inhabit mountainous areas and are adapted to living in rocky terrain. Therefore, it is more plausible that hedgehogs occupied this habitat rather than donkeys, which are more commonly found in flat or grassy areas."}}
{"Q": "The protagonist is growing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plot changes with it. (B) He has to follow the change of atmosphere constantly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The plot changes with it.\nExplanation: As the protagonist grows and develops, their actions, decisions, and motivations will also change. This will naturally affect the direction and outcome of the plot, as the protagonist's growth will likely lead to new challenges, conflicts, and opportunities. Therefore, it is more plausible that the plot will change with the protagonist's growth, rather than the protagonist constantly having to follow the change of atmosphere."}}
{"Q": "The photographer took use of proper light. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He takes a perfect photo. (B) He created a environment similar to the general areas for other wide geckos.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He takes a perfect photo.\nExplanation: Proper use of light is essential in photography as it can greatly affect the quality of the image. By using proper light, the photographer can capture the subject in the best possible way, highlighting its features and creating a visually appealing image. Therefore, it is more plausible that the photographer took a perfect photo as a result of using proper light. The option of creating an environment for geckos seems unrelated to the given information."}}
{"Q": "Astronauts wear spacesuits with lithium hydroxide canisters to work in space. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their exhaled carbon dioxide combines with lithium hydroxide to produce water and purify the air around them. (B) Spacesuits keep them from being affected by gravity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Their exhaled carbon dioxide combines with lithium hydroxide to produce water and purify the air around them.\n\nExplanation: Lithium hydroxide canisters are used in spacesuits to remove carbon dioxide from the air that astronauts breathe. The lithium hydroxide reacts with the carbon dioxide to produce lithium carbonate and water. This process helps to purify the air and remove the carbon dioxide that astronauts exhale. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is incorrect because spacesuits do not protect astronauts from the effects of gravity. Astronauts still experience the effects of gravity in space, but they are in a state of freefall around the Earth, which creates the sensation of weightlessness."}}
{"Q": "The mountain goat has strong hooves for running up the rocky slopes of the mountains. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The mountain goat lives in the mountainous regions. (B) The development of some wolves is blocked.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The mountain goat lives in the mountainous regions.\nExplanation: The mountain goat's strong hooves are an adaptation to its environment. Living in mountainous regions with rocky slopes requires the ability to climb and run on uneven terrain. Therefore, over time, the mountain goat's hooves have evolved to be strong and sturdy to help them navigate their habitat. Choice B, the development of some wolves being blocked, is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the mountain goat's adaptation for running up rocky slopes."}}
{"Q": "The zookeeper raised many animals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She has seen their growth in different times. (B) The zookeeper fed them with milk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Since the zookeeper raised many animals, it is likely that she has seen their growth in different times. This is a plausible answer as it is common for zookeepers to monitor the growth and development of the animals under their care. Feeding them with milk, as stated in option B, is not necessarily true for all animals and may not be the most significant outcome of raising them."}}
{"Q": "Tom was a diabetic when he was 13. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Doctor thinks Tom has insomnia. (B) He had impotence when he was 25.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He had impotence when he was 25.\nExplanation: Diabetes can cause damage to blood vessels and nerves, which can lead to erectile dysfunction (impotence) in men. Insomnia is not a common complication of diabetes."}}
{"Q": "There is Nadolol as an effective choice in all his medicine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack is an optician. (B) My father has mild to moderate hypertension.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Nadolol is a beta-blocker medication commonly used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). Therefore, it is a plausible choice for someone with mild to moderate hypertension, like the speaker's father. Option A, stating that Jack is an optician, is not relevant to the medication choice and does not explain why Nadolol was chosen."}}
{"Q": "Pycnidia grows around Tom's wound. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's wound is exposed to fungus. (B) Tom forgot to clean the infected area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom's wound is exposed to fungus.\nExplanation: Pycnidia are small, flask-shaped structures that produce and release fungal spores. They are commonly found in fungal infections and can grow around wounds that are exposed to fungus. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's wound was exposed to fungus, rather than him forgetting to clean the infected area, as the latter would not necessarily lead to the growth of pycnidia."}}
{"Q": "Only those in certain ranges could see the tides. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Great tides overwhelmed my sight. (B) The coast were filled with visitors for tides.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Great tides overwhelmed my sight.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that only those in certain ranges could see the tides, which implies that the tides were so great that they could only be seen from a specific distance. This is a more plausible explanation than option B, which suggests that the coast was crowded with visitors, which would not affect the visibility of the tides."}}
{"Q": "Jim faces the stress of finding a job. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He often gets cramps. (B) He is too distressed to sleep at night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He is too distressed to sleep at night.\nExplanation: It is common for individuals facing the stress of finding a job to experience sleep disturbances, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep. This can be due to the anxiety and worry associated with job searching, as well as the pressure to secure employment. Cramps, on the other hand, are not typically associated with job search stress."}}
{"Q": "Our teacher pointed out our thought was wrong. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We were ready to go take some nice pictures. (B) We thought macromolecules were scant in cells.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Our teacher pointed out our thought was wrong because we thought macromolecules were scant in cells, which is not true. Macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids are essential components of cells and are present in large quantities. Therefore, our initial thought was incorrect, and our teacher corrected us. Choice (A) about taking pictures is irrelevant to the situation and does not explain why our thought was wrong."}}
{"Q": "A stove is an enclosed space in which fuel is burned to provide heating. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Its surfaces protect people from hurting. (B) The electrons tiny charged particles inside atoms carried the heat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Its surfaces protect people from hurting.\nExplanation: When fuel is burned in a stove, it produces heat which is contained within the enclosed space. The surfaces of the stove are designed to protect people from coming into contact with the heat and getting burned. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the purpose of a stove. Option B is not relevant to the function of a stove as it describes the movement of electrons, which is not directly related to the heating function of a stove."}}
{"Q": "Thunder appears in the sky at once. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The clouds are very thick in the sky. (B) Lightning rapidly heats and expands the surrounding air.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Thunder is caused by lightning rapidly heating and expanding the surrounding air. This creates a shock wave that we hear as thunder. While thick clouds can be a sign of an impending thunderstorm, they are not the direct cause of thunder. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She blamed herself for failure to solve such a natural thing in child's development. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Miss Li's managemant of her class was too strict. (B) Amy didn't deal with the tantrum of her son very well.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Amy didn't deal with the tantrum of her son very well.\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the cause of Amy blaming herself is related to her failure to solve a natural thing in her child's development. Tantrums are a common occurrence in child development, and it is possible that Amy's inability to handle her son's tantrums led to her feeling responsible for her child's behavior. Miss Li's management of the class being too strict is not related to Amy's personal situation and is therefore an unlikely cause."}}
{"Q": "He found the latter has a much wider ranges of distribution. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The botanist specialized in vascular plants investigated bryohytes. (B) Tom looked at the arterioles with the naked eye and with a microscope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The botanist specialized in vascular plants investigated bryophytes.\nExplanation: Bryophytes are non-vascular plants, while vascular plants have specialized tissues for conducting water and nutrients. Therefore, if a botanist specialized in vascular plants investigates bryophytes, they may not have the same level of expertise and knowledge about the distribution of non-vascular plants. This could lead to a wider range of distribution being observed due to potential errors in identification and sampling. On the other hand, option B is not related to the distribution of plants and is therefore an unlikely cause."}}
{"Q": "The room is cooling a little bit. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom bought an oven. (B) Timothy brings some sulfates into the living room.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Timothy brings some sulfates into the living room.\nExplanation: Sulfates are known to have a cooling effect on the environment. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cooling of the room is caused by Timothy bringing sulfates into the living room rather than Tom buying an oven, which would actually increase the temperature in the room."}}
{"Q": "The anole climbed out along the wall of the glass cabinet and ran away. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Peter kept a anole in a glass cabinet. (B) The alien was blocked from water, air  and dust.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Peter kept an anole in a glass cabinet.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that there was an anole in a glass cabinet, and it climbed out and ran away. Therefore, the cause of this was that Peter kept the anole in the glass cabinet, and it was able to escape. Option B about an alien being blocked from water, air, and dust is not relevant to the sentence and does not provide a plausible explanation for the anole's behavior."}}
{"Q": "Jack's mother learns that Jack has an appointment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Time goes on. (B) Jack's mother peeks at Jack's diary.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jack's mother peeks at Jack's diary.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Jack's mother found out about the appointment by invading Jack's privacy and reading his diary. Option (A) \"Time goes on\" is not a logical cause for Jack's mother to learn about his appointment."}}
{"Q": "Tom found a wooden bar to fire the paper. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He started to produce heat with the friction of the bar. (B) He started to produce heat with the moisture of the bar.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He started to produce heat with the friction of the bar.\n\nExplanation: When two objects rub against each other, they create friction, which generates heat. In this case, Tom used the wooden bar to rub against the paper, creating friction and producing heat. Moisture in the bar would not have any significant effect on producing heat in this scenario. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His mother gave him a ladybug. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He told his mother that he wanted a beetle. (B) He needed a hard brittle lustrous dense transition metal of the platinum family.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for his mother giving him a ladybug is that he asked for a beetle. Ladybugs are a type of beetle, and it is common for children to be fascinated by insects and ask for them as pets. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the situation and does not make sense in the context."}}
{"Q": "The results showed she was infected with streptococcus. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary's white blood cell count was significantly lower. (B) The patient has been infected with hepatitis b virus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mary's white blood cell count was significantly lower.\n\nExplanation: Streptococcus is a type of bacteria that can cause infections such as strep throat, pneumonia, and skin infections. A low white blood cell count can make a person more susceptible to infections because white blood cells are responsible for fighting off infections. Therefore, Mary's low white blood cell count may have made her more vulnerable to the streptococcus infection. Hepatitis B virus is a completely different type of infection and would not be the cause of a streptococcus infection."}}
{"Q": "They  went to the theater. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They were hungry. (B) They found it's a room surrounded by walls.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer as they do not logically follow from the statement \"They went to the theater.\" Without further context, it is impossible to determine what happened as a result."}}
{"Q": "She got the frequency of the sound. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Madame Curie studied radium all her life. (B) My mentor calculated the number of recurring periodic waves in one second.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of her getting the frequency of the sound was most likely due to her mentor calculating the number of recurring periodic waves in one second. This is because frequency is defined as the number of cycles per second, or the number of recurring periodic waves in one second. Madame Curie studying radium all her life is not related to the frequency of the sound."}}
{"Q": "Mary felt the extrusion of a mass through her vagina. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor told her it was a common physiological response. (B) The docter diagnoised her with prolapse.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The doctor diagnosed her with prolapse.\nExplanation: The extrusion of a mass through the vagina is a common symptom of pelvic organ prolapse, which occurs when the pelvic organs (such as the uterus, bladder, or rectum) descend into or outside of the vaginal canal. This can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with urination or bowel movements. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor would diagnose Mary with prolapse rather than telling her it was a common physiological response."}}
{"Q": "Lucy eats barley every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was healthy. (B) She keeps a healthy state.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was healthy.\nExplanation: Barley is a nutritious grain that is high in fiber, protein, and various vitamins and minerals. Eating barley regularly can help maintain a healthy weight, lower cholesterol levels, and reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that Lucy's regular consumption of barley contributed to her overall health and well-being. However, it is important to note that other factors such as exercise, sleep, and stress management also play a role in maintaining good health."}}
{"Q": "Scientists pick one out of thousands of breeds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mathematician met a math problem. (B) Farmers want to grow sweeter oranges.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Farmers want to grow sweeter oranges.\nExplanation: Scientists selecting one breed out of thousands is more likely to be related to agriculture and breeding practices. Farmers are always looking for ways to improve their crops, and selecting a breed that produces sweeter oranges would be a desirable trait. This process involves careful selection and crossbreeding to achieve the desired characteristics, which is a common practice in agriculture. On the other hand, the mathematician meeting a math problem is not related to the selection of a breed of oranges."}}
{"Q": "He begins to bleed in the nose. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom smokes all the year. (B) Eating lobsters makes Luke allergic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Nosebleeds can be caused by a variety of factors, including allergies. If Luke is allergic to lobsters and consumed them, it could have triggered a reaction that led to the nosebleed. Smoking can also cause nosebleeds, but the fact that Tom smokes all year does not necessarily mean that it was the cause in this specific instance."}}
{"Q": "Tom gave his patient a barbiturates injection in order to relieve his pain during the operation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was happy and perform in a better way. (B) The patient still suffered from serious pain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The patient still suffered from serious pain.\nExplanation: Barbiturates are a type of sedative that can help relieve pain and induce sleep. However, they are not always effective for all types of pain and may have side effects such as drowsiness, confusion, and respiratory depression. Therefore, it is possible that the patient still experienced pain despite the injection, especially if the pain was severe or caused by a condition that is not responsive to barbiturates. It is important for healthcare providers to carefully assess and manage pain in their patients using a variety of approaches, including medication, non-pharmacological interventions, and patient education."}}
{"Q": "Alice gave Lucy a call. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She told Lucy a lot of news. (B) Lucy was disfigured.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She told Lucy a lot of news.\nExplanation: Since the question does not provide any context or information about the nature of the call, it is safe to assume that Alice called Lucy to share some news or information with her. Option B, which suggests that Lucy was disfigured as a result of the call, is highly unlikely and lacks any logical connection to the given information. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom ate a lot of pots of brambles this year. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's crops were eaten by insects. (B) Tom sowed bramble seeds last year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom sowed bramble seeds last year.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if Tom sowed bramble seeds last year, it would make sense that he would have a lot of brambles to eat this year. On the other hand, if his crops were eaten by insects, it would be unlikely that he would have a lot of brambles to eat."}}
{"Q": "They finally made a new mental containing titanium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The factory needed to improve the quality of production. (B) Scientists are studying a new type of material to make spacecraft.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The mention of titanium being used for spacecraft suggests that the development of this new mental was likely driven by scientific research and advancements in aerospace technology, rather than a need to improve production quality in a factory. Titanium is a lightweight and strong metal that is commonly used in aerospace applications, so it makes sense that scientists would be studying ways to improve its properties for use in spacecraft."}}
{"Q": "Jessy flattened the blanket on her bed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The colorful pillows of the blanket faces up. (B) The colorful surface of the blanket faces up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The colorful surface of the blanket faces up.\nExplanation: When Jessy flattened the blanket on her bed, the colorful surface of the blanket would naturally face up as it is the side meant to be seen and used. The pillows on the blanket are likely to remain in their original position and not be affected by the act of flattening the blanket. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "People on the street didn't get wet even without an umbrella. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It has been hailing heavily outside for a few hours. (B) Too many international activities were held in this city.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If it has been hailing heavily outside for a few hours, it is possible that the hailstones have formed a protective layer on the ground, preventing the rainwater from seeping through and wetting people on the street. On the other hand, international activities held in the city have no direct correlation with people not getting wet without an umbrella. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "These two species benefit from their interaction. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The environment becomes better. (B) They achieved Mutualism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They achieved Mutualism.\nExplanation: Mutualism is a type of symbiotic relationship where both species involved benefit from their interaction. Therefore, if two species are benefiting from their interaction, it is likely that they have achieved mutualism. Option A, \"The environment becomes better,\" is not necessarily a direct result of mutualism, although it is possible that mutualistic interactions could contribute to overall ecosystem health."}}
{"Q": "Waterwheels satrted work efficiently. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The mills can set to work. (B) The scientists have invented replacements.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The mills can set to work.\nExplanation: Waterwheels were commonly used to power mills for grinding grain, sawing wood, and other industrial processes. When waterwheels started working efficiently, it meant that the mills could operate more effectively and produce more goods. This would have had a significant impact on the local economy and the availability of goods for trade and consumption. On the other hand, there is no indication that scientists have invented replacements for waterwheels as they are still used in some parts of the world today. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A biologist measured the amount of venom used by rattlesnakes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got the quantity. (B) He found that its amount could be adjusted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He found that its amount could be adjusted.\n\nExplanation: By measuring the amount of venom used by rattlesnakes, the biologist likely discovered that the amount of venom they release can vary and may be adjusted based on factors such as the size of their prey or the level of threat they perceive. This finding could have important implications for understanding the behavior and ecology of rattlesnakes, as well as for developing treatments for snakebite victims."}}
{"Q": "Alice eats some health products containing antacids. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice felt headache. (B) The painkillers he took before have failed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The painkillers he took before have failed.\nExplanation: Antacids are used to neutralize stomach acid and relieve symptoms of heartburn and indigestion. They do not typically cause headaches. However, if Alice had taken painkillers for a headache before taking the antacids, the antacids may have interfered with the absorption of the painkillers, causing them to be less effective. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "People can always recognize aardvark easily. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Aardwolf show its butt. (B) Aardvark always looks different from other sea creatures.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Aardvarks are not sea creatures, they are land mammals found in Africa. The reason people can easily recognize aardvarks is because of their unique physical characteristics, such as their long snouts, large ears, and distinctive markings. Aardwolves, on the other hand, are also land mammals found in Africa, but they are much smaller and have different physical features than aardvarks. Additionally, aardwolves do not typically show their butts in a way that would make them easily recognizable."}}
{"Q": "The naughty boy knew his sistar hate animals with big mouths. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He pulls out the spines that emit venom. (B) He caught a bass to scare her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He caught a bass to scare her.\nExplanation: Pulling out spines that emit venom is a dangerous and cruel act that could harm both the boy and the animal. It is also unlikely that the boy would have access to such animals. On the other hand, catching a bass with a big mouth is a more plausible scenario and could potentially scare his sister who hates animals with big mouths. However, it is not a kind or respectful way to treat animals and should not be encouraged."}}
{"Q": "Water is formed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A singly charged ion gains an electron. (B) Jack breaks down hydrogen peroxide.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Water is formed when two hydrogen atoms each share their single electron with an oxygen atom, forming covalent bonds. This results in the formation of a water molecule, H2O. This process does not involve the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, as stated in option B. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His skin was caustised. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom often touches the tin bar without any protection. (B) Jack keeps frictioning his arm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom often touches the tin bar without any protection.\nExplanation: Caustic substances can cause chemical burns on the skin. Tin is a metal that can react with moisture and acids to produce caustic compounds. If Tom frequently touches the tin bar without gloves or other protective gear, his skin may have been exposed to these compounds and suffered a chemical burn. Friction from rubbing (option B) can cause skin irritation and abrasions, but it is less likely to cause a caustic burn."}}
{"Q": "Geese spend a lot of time staying in their nests. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Geese build their nests carefully. (B) Geese usually build their nests near the water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Geese spend a lot of time staying in their nests to incubate their eggs and care for their young. This means that they need to build their nests carefully to ensure that they provide a safe and comfortable environment for their offspring. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the behavior of geese in their nests. Option B may also be true, but it is not necessarily a direct result of geese spending time in their nests."}}
{"Q": "As the environment deteriorates, the mass of the star decreases. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It becomes less bright than before. (B) The same is true of galaxy clusters.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It becomes less bright than before.\nExplanation: The mass of a star is directly related to its luminosity or brightness. As the mass of the star decreases due to environmental deterioration, its luminosity also decreases. This is because the energy produced by the star is directly proportional to its mass. Therefore, a decrease in mass results in a decrease in energy output and hence a decrease in brightness. On the other hand, the mass of galaxy clusters is not directly related to the brightness of individual stars within them, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The guide adviced the tourists to have a rest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The guide lead the tourists to climb the mountain. (B) The traffic was very busy on the city streets.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The guide advised the tourists to have a rest because they had just climbed the mountain, which can be physically exhausting. Option B about busy city streets is not relevant to the given information."}}
{"Q": "They used several different materials. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They are asked to make composites. (B) Their group was in charge of the gelatin Infiltration.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They are asked to make composites.\nExplanation: The use of several different materials is a common practice when making composites. Composites are materials made by combining two or more different materials to create a new material with improved properties. By using different materials, the group can create a composite with specific properties such as strength, durability, and flexibility. Therefore, it is more plausible that the group used different materials to make composites rather than being in charge of gelatin infiltration, which does not necessarily require the use of multiple materials."}}
{"Q": "Mike's parents sent Mike to learn decryption. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They remained silent. (B) Mike learned to reverse the unintelligible data into meaningful data using a key.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Mike learned to reverse the unintelligible data into meaningful data using a key.\nExplanation: Since Mike was sent to learn decryption, it is likely that he was successful in learning how to decrypt data using a key. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A does not provide any information about what happened as a result of Mike's parents sending him to learn decryption."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a peel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Since then, Tom's skin has become red. (B) His lung functions were seriously affected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Since then, Tom's skin has become red.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's skin became red as a result of having a peel, as this could indicate a skin irritation or allergic reaction. It is unlikely that his lung functions would be affected by having a peel."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has bought a professional book. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She firstly gave a look at the guideline. (B) She extremely likes her trainer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She firstly gave a look at the guideline.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Lucy would first look at the guideline of the professional book she bought, as it would help her understand the content and structure of the book. There is no indication in the question that Lucy has a trainer or that she likes them, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Metals with high conductivity can be used to make wires. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Copper, tin and aluminum are all good choices. (B) Machines become more effective using these materials.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Metals with high conductivity, such as copper, tin, and aluminum, are commonly used to make wires because they allow electricity to flow through them easily. This has resulted in these metals becoming popular choices for electrical wiring and other applications where conductivity is important. While machines may benefit from the use of these materials, the primary advantage is their ability to conduct electricity efficiently."}}
{"Q": "Lily has conflict with Lucy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their friends mediate their conflicts. (B) Feeder attributes it to their frequent predation behavior.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: When Lily has a conflict with Lucy, it is more likely that their friends will mediate their conflicts. Feeder attributes it to their frequent predation behavior is not a plausible answer as it does not make sense in the context of a conflict between two individuals. Mediation by friends is a common way to resolve conflicts and is a more likely outcome in this situation."}}
{"Q": "There are many dwarfism patients. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Most of them have achondroplasia. (B) The number of pathogenic microorganisms increased rapidly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Most of them have achondroplasia.\nExplanation: Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, accounting for about 70% of all cases. It is caused by a genetic mutation that affects bone growth, resulting in short stature and other physical characteristics. While there may be other forms of dwarfism, such as hypochondroplasia or spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, they are much less common than achondroplasia. Therefore, it is more plausible that most dwarfism patients have achondroplasia rather than an increase in pathogenic microorganisms."}}
{"Q": "John was not armed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He picked up a stick. (B) He died.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He picked up a stick.\nExplanation: Since John was not armed, he may have felt vulnerable and decided to pick up a stick to defend himself or to use as a tool. It is more plausible than him dying as a result of not being armed."}}
{"Q": "Plasmodium vivax malaria of one of them was passed to the other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Host switch occurred between the two patients. (B) Role switch occurred between the two patients.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Host switch occurred between the two patients.\n\nExplanation: Plasmodium vivax is a species of malaria parasite that is transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is not possible for a role switch to occur between two patients, as the parasite requires a mosquito vector to complete its life cycle. Therefore, the most plausible explanation for one patient passing the infection to another is that a host switch occurred, meaning that the infected mosquito that bit the first patient subsequently bit the second patient, transmitting the parasite."}}
{"Q": "The criminal repeated his previous crime. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This is a case of recidivism. (B) ADIS's doctor says ADIS's brain always unabated thinking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This is a case of recidivism.\nExplanation: Recidivism refers to the tendency of a criminal to repeat their criminal behavior. It is a common phenomenon among criminals, and it can be caused by various factors such as lack of rehabilitation, social and economic factors, and psychological issues. In this case, the criminal repeated his previous crime, which suggests that he has a tendency to engage in criminal behavior. Therefore, the most plausible explanation for his behavior is recidivism. The second option, which suggests that the criminal has a medical condition that causes him to engage in criminal behavior, is less likely as there is no evidence to support this claim."}}
{"Q": "In an orchard, a photographer prepares to take a picture of papaya flowers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The grower tells the photographer to come back when the papayas are about one meter tall. (B) She thinks my health condition is not very good.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The grower tells the photographer to come back when the papayas are about one meter tall.\nExplanation: Since the photographer is preparing to take a picture of papaya flowers, it is likely that the grower knows that the flowers are not yet in bloom. Papaya trees typically start to flower when they are about one meter tall, so it makes sense for the grower to suggest that the photographer come back at that time to capture the desired image. Option B is not a plausible answer as there is no indication in the question that the photographer's health condition is relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Jack is an agronomist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has separated many amino acids. (B) He studies the particular plant science concerning crop production.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: An agronomist is a scientist who specializes in the study of crop production and soil management. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack studies the particular plant science concerning crop production rather than separating amino acids, which is not directly related to his field of expertise."}}
{"Q": "Many biologist went there for their rarity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He saw a native plant in the desert. (B) It is said that brachiopods appeared in that forest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that many biologists went to a certain location for their rarity. The fact that brachiopods appeared in that forest is a more plausible reason for their interest, as brachiopods are a rare and ancient group of marine animals that are not commonly found in forests. The sighting of a native plant in the desert may also be of interest to biologists, but it is not as rare or unusual as the appearance of brachiopods in a forest."}}
{"Q": "She bought some meat as fodder. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary drank some black tea. (B) She keeps some ringtails.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She keeps some ringtails.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary bought meat as fodder to feed her ringtails, which are small mammals that are commonly kept as pets and require a diet that includes meat. On the other hand, drinking black tea has no apparent connection to buying meat as fodder."}}
{"Q": "John bought some kits. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their total weight is 100 ounces. (B) They are planted in the backyard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Their total weight is 100 ounces.\nExplanation: The statement implies that John did something with the kits, but it does not suggest that he planted them in the backyard. However, it does provide information about the kits' weight, indicating that their total weight is 100 ounces. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The protein expression will not be regulated in this case. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Poison damages protein by destroying the peptides. (B) Poison is conducive to the peptides in protein.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Poison damages protein by destroying the peptides.\n\nExplanation: If the poison damages the protein by destroying the peptides, then the protein expression will not be regulated because the peptides are necessary for the proper folding and function of the protein. Without the peptides, the protein may be misfolded or non-functional, leading to a lack of regulation. On the other hand, if the poison is conducive to the peptides in protein, it may enhance protein expression, but this is not the scenario described in the question. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My father told me it was a pupae. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike sat on the ground. (B) I didn't know what the small brown capsule was.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I didn't know what the small brown capsule was.\nExplanation: The fact that the father identified the object as a pupae suggests that he had some knowledge or experience with identifying insect life stages. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the confusion was due to the speaker's lack of knowledge about the object, rather than someone sitting on the ground."}}
{"Q": "We can see many stripes on their backs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kudus are African animals. (B) Fans hit the laser on the face of the star.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kudus are African animals.\nExplanation: Kudus are African antelopes known for their distinctive white stripes on their brownish-grey coats. These stripes help to camouflage them in their natural habitat and protect them from predators. Therefore, it is more plausible that the stripes seen on their backs are a natural characteristic of the kudus rather than being caused by fans hitting a laser on a star's face."}}
{"Q": "The blanket was dirty. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He cleaned the surfaces. (B) He cleaned the inside of the blanket.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He cleaned the inside of the blanket.\nExplanation: If the blanket was dirty, it would make more sense to clean the inside of the blanket where the dirt and stains are likely to be. Cleaning the surfaces would not necessarily address the issue of a dirty blanket."}}
{"Q": "The plankton bloom all died of the pollution. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The manta was hungry. (B) Now we are confronted with the energy crisis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Plankton is a primary source of food for many marine animals, including the manta. If the plankton bloom dies due to pollution, it can lead to a decrease in the food chain, which can ultimately result in an energy crisis. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It was destroyed by large amounts of electrical energy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plane was hit in thunderclouds. (B) This car was bombed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The plane was hit in thunderclouds.\nExplanation: Thunderclouds are known to contain large amounts of electrical energy, and planes flying through them can be struck by lightning, which can cause significant damage or even destruction of the aircraft. This scenario is more plausible than a car being bombed, as it is less common for cars to be targeted in such a way."}}
{"Q": "He can walk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is four-month years old. (B) Tom eats some health products containing enzymes every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Tom eats health products containing enzymes every day is not directly related to his ability to walk. However, a healthy diet can contribute to overall physical development and strength, which could potentially aid in his ability to walk. On the other hand, being four months old is a normal age for infants to begin learning how to walk, so it is not a significant cause for his ability to walk. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I try to watch his behaviours. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My dog was biting clippings. (B) I want judge her boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions watching \"his\" behaviors, which implies that the subject being observed is male. Additionally, the fact that the dog is biting clippings suggests that the speaker is monitoring the dog's behavior, not a human's. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B does not make sense in the context of the statement."}}
{"Q": "The metal was conducting electricity. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It ran to other's areas. (B) The electrons tiny charged particles inside atoms carried the electricity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The electrons tiny charged particles inside atoms carried the electricity.\nExplanation: When a metal conducts electricity, it means that the electrons in the metal are able to move freely and carry the electric charge. This is because metals have a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons that are not bound to any particular atom and can move throughout the material. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer as it accurately describes the mechanism of how electricity is conducted in metals. Option (A) is not a valid explanation as electricity does not \"run\" to other areas, but rather flows through the material due to the movement of electrons."}}
{"Q": "Cannibalism seems to have been acceptable in the earliest times. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Prevalent phenomena are usually acceptable at that time. (B) Twenty years have passed since the massacre.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: In the earliest times, humans were still evolving and developing their moral codes and societal norms. Cannibalism may have been prevalent due to factors such as food scarcity or cultural practices, and therefore was deemed acceptable at the time. As societies developed and evolved, cannibalism became less acceptable and was eventually outlawed in most cultures."}}
{"Q": "Vegetarian don't eat meat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Hares wont eat meat. (B) It is harder for them to resist the warmth in winter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Hares won't eat meat.\nExplanation: The fact that vegetarians don't eat meat has no direct correlation with their ability to resist warmth in winter. However, hares are herbivores and do not eat meat, so it is plausible that they would not eat meat regardless of whether or not they are vegetarian."}}
{"Q": "Many birds are flying to south these days. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Humans produce lots of halons today. (B) Winter is coming.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Winter is coming.\nExplanation: Many bird species migrate to warmer regions during the winter months to avoid the harsh weather conditions and lack of food. This behavior is a natural adaptation to survive in changing environments. The production of halons by humans may have negative impacts on the environment, but it is not directly related to bird migration. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mapel only sees a lot of light spots. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The teacher asked students to list some kinds of large antelopes. (B) Mapel looked at the stars through a telescope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Mapel looked at the stars through a telescope, it is likely that they would only see light spots, as stars appear as small points of light in the night sky. On the other hand, if the teacher asked students to list some kinds of large antelopes, it is unlikely that this would cause Mapel to only see light spots."}}
{"Q": "He found that it consists of many living parenchymatous cells. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The researcher analyzed the nucellus into details. (B) John discovered some chondrites.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The researcher analyzed the nucellus into details.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the researcher found that the structure consists of many living parenchymatous cells. This suggests that the researcher examined the nucellus in detail and observed the presence of these cells. Option B, which mentions the discovery of chondrites, is not related to the observation of living parenchymatous cells in the nucellus. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The growth of Myceliums should be promised in Tom's experiment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have done a lot of experiments. (B) Tom put the microorganism in suitable substrate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Tom promised the growth of Myceliums in his experiment by putting the microorganism in a suitable substrate. This means that he provided the necessary conditions for the Myceliums to grow, such as the right temperature, pH, and nutrients. By doing so, he was able to observe the growth of the Myceliums and collect data for his experiment. Choice A is not a plausible answer as it does not directly address the question of what happened as a result of Tom's actions."}}
{"Q": "It was almosted destroyed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A traveler found a piece of yellow quartz. (B) The natural habitat was exploited a lot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The natural habitat was exploited a lot.\nExplanation: The phrase \"almost destroyed\" suggests that the cause was a significant and ongoing threat to the environment. Exploitation of natural resources, such as deforestation, pollution, and overfishing, can have devastating effects on ecosystems and lead to the destruction of habitats. On the other hand, the discovery of a piece of yellow quartz by a traveler is unlikely to have such a significant impact on the environment. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She finds some hepaticas in the fields. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mother-in-law wants to plant some plants. (B) Luna wants to take pictures of some flowers in early spring.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Luna wants to take pictures of some flowers in early spring.\nExplanation: Hepaticas are early spring flowers that bloom in fields and woodlands. It is more plausible that Luna found them while searching for flowers to photograph rather than her mother-in-law planting them in the fields. Hepaticas are also not commonly planted by gardeners, as they are native wildflowers."}}
{"Q": "The government encourages students to learn knowledge. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The teacher asks parents to provide books to their children. (B) Only in this way can students make an impact in the future.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: If the government encourages students to learn knowledge, it is more likely that the teacher will ask parents to provide books to their children. This is because books are a primary source of knowledge, and the teacher may not have enough resources to provide books for all students. Therefore, asking parents to provide books is a plausible solution to encourage students to learn. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not directly relate to the government's encouragement of learning knowledge."}}
{"Q": "His parents told him not to be afraid of ravens. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The clinical manifestations of wilson disease mainly are dyskinesia such as limb tremor, bradykinesia, gait instability and lmental symptoms such as lethargy, mental behavior changes. (B) The child described big black birds in his dream.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The cause of his parents telling him not to be afraid of ravens is likely due to the child describing big black birds in his dream. It is a more plausible explanation than the clinical manifestations of Wilson disease, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and liver."}}
{"Q": "She went to buy beets in the supermarket. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor told the pregnant woman to have food with high folic acid. (B) His mother asked him to buy a green vegetable.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor told the pregnant woman to have food with high folic acid.\nExplanation: Beets are a good source of folic acid, which is important for pregnant women to consume for the healthy development of the fetus. Therefore, it is more plausible that the woman went to buy beets because her doctor advised her to do so, rather than because someone asked her to buy a green vegetable."}}
{"Q": "He was interest in painting. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His favorite was the painting patterns. (B) He was experienced with painting.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was experienced with painting.\nExplanation: The sentence states that he was interested in painting, which implies that he had some level of involvement or experience with it. Therefore, it is more plausible that he was experienced with painting rather than simply having a preference for a certain type of painting pattern."}}
{"Q": "There are many areas in our country. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They require development. (B) We can identify the, through their different characteristics.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They require development.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that there are many areas in our country, which implies that some of these areas may be underdeveloped or lacking in certain resources or infrastructure. Therefore, it is more plausible that the areas require development to improve the quality of life for the people living there. On the other hand, while it is true that different areas may have distinct characteristics, this does not necessarily have a significant impact on the development needs of the areas."}}
{"Q": "The prospect of the harvest looks bleak. . What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The annual precipitation of this region is up to 800 to 1200 mm. (B) There is no precipitation in this region. .", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There is no precipitation in this region.\n\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the prospect of the harvest looks bleak, which implies that there is a lack of water for crops to grow. Option (B) states that there is no precipitation in this region, which is a more plausible reason for the poor harvest than option (A), which mentions a relatively high amount of annual precipitation. Without any precipitation, the crops would not receive the necessary water to grow and produce a good harvest."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes to eat tasteful fruit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom eats apples. (B) Tom often buys avocados.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom often buys avocados.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that Tom has a preference for tasteful fruit, which implies that he is likely to seek out fruits that are known for their flavor. While apples can be tasty, they are not necessarily known for their exceptional taste. On the other hand, avocados are often considered to be a delicious and flavorful fruit, making them a more plausible choice for someone who values taste. Therefore, option B is a more likely outcome based on the given information."}}
{"Q": "He is the deputy of the CEO. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He builds frames. (B) He is responsible for the security of CEO.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He is responsible for the security of CEO.\nExplanation: As the deputy of the CEO, it is more likely that he would be responsible for the security of the CEO rather than building frames. Building frames does not seem to be related to his position as the deputy of the CEO. However, ensuring the safety and security of the CEO is an important responsibility that often falls on the deputy or other high-ranking executives in a company."}}
{"Q": "Scientists found that nocturnal insets and the flowers themsleves do great help. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wang is an expert of mechanics. (B) Scientists are studying pollination of flowers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The question mentions the help provided by nocturnal insects and flowers in achieving a certain outcome. The only relevant choice is B, which suggests that scientists are studying pollination of flowers. Therefore, it is plausible that the scientists found that nocturnal insects and flowers play a role in pollination."}}
{"Q": "His stomach mucosa was damaged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom ate a lot of spicy food. (B) The man had contact with the source of Psittacosis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The man had contact with the source of Psittacosis.\nExplanation: Psittacosis is a bacterial infection that can be transmitted from birds to humans. It can cause damage to the stomach mucosa, among other symptoms. Eating spicy food may cause discomfort or irritation in the stomach, but it is unlikely to cause significant damage to the mucosa. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The student majored in medicine had to choose a ressearch interest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He worked in the department of medicine. (B) He chose Psychiatry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He chose Psychiatry.\nExplanation: Since the student majored in medicine, it is likely that he had a broad understanding of various medical fields. Therefore, he would have had the opportunity to explore different areas of medicine and choose a research interest that aligned with his personal interests and career goals. Psychiatry is a popular field of medicine that deals with mental health and disorders, and it is a viable option for someone with a medical background to pursue research in this area."}}
{"Q": "My father is an acrobat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He tried to make my body highly stiff. (B) He tried to make my body highly plastic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: As an acrobat, the father would likely want his child to have a highly flexible and adaptable body, which would be better achieved through making the body highly plastic rather than stiff. Stiffness would limit the child's ability to perform acrobatic feats."}}
{"Q": "Capitalism had a rapid development in this country. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Two hundred people died. (B) Many factories which concentrated on production sprung up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Many factories which concentrated on production sprung up.\nExplanation: As capitalism developed in a country, it led to the growth of industries and businesses. This resulted in the establishment of many factories that focused on production, leading to an increase in employment opportunities and economic growth. While there may have been some negative consequences of rapid industrialization, such as poor working conditions and environmental degradation, the growth of factories was a common and expected outcome of capitalist development. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There was a quake in the city. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many women died at that time. (B) The instrument detected the wave.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The instrument detected the wave.\nExplanation: When there is an earthquake, seismometers or other instruments detect the seismic waves generated by the earthquake. These instruments are designed to measure the intensity, duration, and frequency of the waves. Therefore, it is more plausible that the earthquake was detected by an instrument rather than many women dying at that time."}}
{"Q": "I saw the baby guppies come out and swim away. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I observed the whole process of guppies giving birth. (B) I watched guppies eat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The observation of baby guppies being born and swimming away suggests that the cause was witnessing the process of guppies giving birth. This is a plausible explanation as guppies are livebearers and give birth to live young, which can be observed swimming away shortly after birth. Watching guppies eat would not be a likely cause for the observation of baby guppies being born and swimming away."}}
{"Q": "The source of the toxins were exposed to a large amount of heat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They got poisoned. (B) It emited a lot highly toxic fumes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It emitted a lot of highly toxic fumes.\nExplanation: When toxins are exposed to high heat, they can break down and release toxic fumes into the air. This can be dangerous for anyone who inhales the fumes, as they can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. Therefore, it is important to handle toxins carefully and avoid exposing them to high temperatures."}}
{"Q": "She is able to move body joints through a full range of motion. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Linda has suffered from constipation for a week. (B) Mary's body is very flexibel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Mary's body is very flexible, which allows her to move her body joints through a full range of motion. Constipation has no relation to joint mobility."}}
{"Q": "He hydrolyzed collagen by boiling skin ligaments tendons etc. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted to get some gelatine. (B) Tom is lack of platelets.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Hydrolyzing collagen by boiling skin, ligaments, tendons, etc. is a common method of obtaining gelatine. Gelatine is a protein substance derived from collagen and is used in various food products, such as desserts, candies, and marshmallows. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom wanted to obtain gelatine rather than being lack of platelets, which is unrelated to the process of hydrolyzing collagen."}}
{"Q": "There are water drops on the inner wall of the bag after the banana is ripe. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bananas help gastrointestinal motility. (B) Tom puts the bananas in the bag to ripen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom puts the bananas in the bag to ripen.\n\nExplanation: When Tom puts the bananas in the bag to ripen, the bag traps the ethylene gas that the bananas release. This gas speeds up the ripening process of the bananas. As the bananas ripen, they release moisture, which condenses on the inner wall of the bag, forming water droplets. Therefore, the presence of water drops on the inner wall of the bag is a result of the ripening process of the bananas. Choice (A) is not related to the formation of water drops on the inner wall of the bag."}}
{"Q": "Air saturation builds up. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The night in the fall becomes longer. (B) The resistivity increases gradually.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The resistivity increases gradually.\nExplanation: When air saturation builds up, it means that the air is holding more moisture than it can normally hold. This can lead to an increase in the resistivity of materials, as the moisture in the air can cause electrical conductivity to decrease. This can have implications for various industries, such as electronics and power transmission, where changes in resistivity can affect the performance of equipment. The length of the night in the fall is not related to air saturation."}}
{"Q": "From its body can be seen the prosperity of the Song Dynasty. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) That piece of blue and white porcelain is fake. (B) That piece of blue and white porcelain dates from the Song Dynasty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) That piece of blue and white porcelain dates from the Song Dynasty.\nExplanation: Blue and white porcelain was a significant product of the Song Dynasty, and it was highly valued and exported to other countries. The prosperity of the Song Dynasty was due to its advanced technology, efficient administration, and flourishing economy, which allowed for the production and trade of luxury goods like blue and white porcelain. Therefore, it is more plausible that the piece of blue and white porcelain reflects the prosperity of the Song Dynasty rather than being fake."}}
{"Q": "The developing bud lost its protection. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Snowflakes fell down in the humid weather. (B) Seapals were ruptured by naughty kids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Snowflakes fell down in the humid weather.\nExplanation: Snowflakes falling down in humid weather can cause damage to developing buds as the weight of the snow can break off branches or damage the protective covering of the bud. On the other hand, seapals being ruptured by naughty kids seems less plausible as it is unlikely that children would be able to access the developing buds and cause damage."}}
{"Q": "He found warthogs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At night Tom explored the subterranean burrows often excavated by aardvarks. (B) Tom wants to make Ales by his own.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Tom found warthogs, so the cause of this must be related to his actions. Choice A provides a plausible explanation as it suggests that Tom was exploring the burrows often excavated by aardvarks, which could be a habitat for warthogs. Choice B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide a logical explanation for Tom finding warthogs."}}
{"Q": "Ensuring their nutrition is critical. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sheep still need to be outdoors in winter. (B) Some cuckoos are foraging for food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Ensuring the nutrition of sheep is critical because they still need to be outdoors in winter. During this time, the availability of food may be limited, and it is important to ensure that the sheep have access to enough food to maintain their health and well-being. In contrast, the presence of foraging cuckoos would not be a significant factor in the nutrition of sheep."}}
{"Q": "Bob read some related publications. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He learned more details. (B) He got some overviews.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: When someone reads related publications, it is likely that they will gain more detailed knowledge about the topic. Overviews may be provided, but the primary purpose of reading related publications is to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He studied at what are quills made of. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At last he knew they were made of modified hairs with a coat of keratin. (B) At last he knew they were made of silk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) At last he knew they were made of modified hairs with a coat of keratin.\nExplanation: Quills are typically made from the modified hairs of birds, porcupines, or other animals. These hairs are coated with a tough protein called keratin, which makes them strong and durable. By studying quills, one can learn about the structure and properties of keratin, as well as the adaptations that animals have evolved to protect themselves from predators. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person studying quills would learn that they are made of modified hairs with a coat of keratin, rather than silk, which is not commonly used in quill production."}}
{"Q": "The Smiths live in Amazon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The elderly in the family are all over 90 years old. (B) They've had problems.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They've had problems.\nExplanation: The statement about the Smiths living in Amazon does not provide any information that would suggest the elderly in the family are all over 90 years old. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer. However, living in the Amazon rainforest can present various challenges and problems, such as dealing with extreme weather conditions, limited access to resources, and potential threats from wildlife. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom discovers that cubs live in different areas of the zoo depending on their genders. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has been studying animal living habits recently. (B) Tom visited the zoo.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Tom's discovery of cubs living in different areas of the zoo depending on their genders suggests that he observed this during his visit to the zoo. It is unlikely that he would have gained this knowledge solely from studying animal living habits, as this information is specific to the zoo's management practices."}}
{"Q": "Juices are not as good as fruits. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I hate vegetables. (B) Squeezing the juice out of the fruit diminishes the nutritions inside.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Squeezing the juice out of the fruit diminishes the nutritions inside. When fruits are juiced, the process removes the fiber and some of the nutrients that are found in the whole fruit. Additionally, many store-bought juices contain added sugars and preservatives, which can further diminish their nutritional value. Eating whole fruits provides more fiber and nutrients, making them a healthier choice than juices."}}
{"Q": "After World War II, global governance has changed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After the Second World War, the population's standard of living and reactions changed. (B) Due to the Second World War, we need to change the way of governence.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Due to the Second World War, we need to change the way of governance.\n\nExplanation: The Second World War had a significant impact on the world, leading to the deaths of millions of people and causing widespread destruction. The war also highlighted the need for a new approach to global governance, as the existing system had failed to prevent the conflict. As a result, the United Nations was established in 1945, with the aim of promoting international cooperation and preventing future wars. This marked a significant shift in global governance, as countries began to work together more closely to address common challenges and promote peace and stability. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He substituted linseed oil for soybean oil. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is very careful about eating healthy. (B) The researcher needed a kind of addition compound.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the researcher needed a kind of addition compound that could be formed using linseed oil instead of soybean oil. This substitution may have been made based on the specific properties of linseed oil that were needed for the experiment or research project. It is less likely that Tom's personal dietary preferences would have influenced this decision, as the use of linseed oil in a laboratory setting is not related to food consumption."}}
{"Q": "She likes their turquoise plumage especially. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy keeps a jackdaw at home. (B) Mary likes motmots very much.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Mary likes motmots very much.\nExplanation: The sentence specifically mentions \"their turquoise plumage,\" which refers to the motmots. There is no mention of a jackdaw, so option A is not relevant. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer as it directly states that Mary likes motmots."}}
{"Q": "The old man wanted to keep healthy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The old man ate food that can purify his body. (B) His mom supervised him to exercise.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The old man ate food that can purify his body.\nExplanation: Eating food that can purify the body is a common way to maintain good health. It is a plausible answer as it is a simple and effective way to keep the body healthy. Option B, where his mom supervised him to exercise, is less likely as the old man is already old and may not need supervision to exercise. Additionally, the question does not mention anything about his mom being involved in his health routine."}}
{"Q": "I planted dogwoods in my garden. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It thrived without competing with other various plants. (B) It thrived without being overwhelmed by other various plants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It thrived without being overwhelmed by other various plants.\nExplanation: Dogwoods are understory trees that prefer partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. If they were planted in a garden with other various plants that compete for resources, such as sunlight, water, and nutrients, they may not have thrived as well. However, if they were planted in an area where they were not overwhelmed by other plants, they would have had a better chance to grow and thrive. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I think lotions are better. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I want to lose weight and keep in good health at the same time. (B) I once used ointments.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement \"I think lotions are better\" suggests that the speaker has had experience using both lotions and ointments. Therefore, option (B) \"I once used ointments\" is a more plausible answer as it implies that the speaker has tried both and has found lotions to be more effective or preferable. Option (A) \"I want to lose weight and keep in good health at the same time\" is not relevant to the topic of lotions vs. ointments."}}
{"Q": "Attendants who are familiar with safety instructions are needed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Some cargos need to be unloaded from the freighters. (B) Customers should be informed of safety instructions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Customers should be informed of safety instructions.\n\nExplanation: The statement mentions the need for attendants who are familiar with safety instructions. This suggests that there are customers who need to be informed of safety instructions, which could be for various reasons such as boarding a flight, using a theme park ride, or participating in a water sport. It is less likely that the need for attendants is related to unloading cargo from freighters, as this would require a different set of skills and expertise."}}
{"Q": "She could live her natural life span. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Maxon officially became a gymnast. (B) The poor lady became our queen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Becoming a queen typically comes with access to better healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions, which can increase life expectancy. On the other hand, becoming a gymnast does not necessarily guarantee a longer life span. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Experts worry that the environmental protection policy on petroleum use will be aborted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The aquarium needs to create a natural landscape for the animals so that they can better adapt to the environment of the aquarium. (B) People have long been inseparable from petrochemicals such as plastics.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The use of petroleum and petrochemicals is deeply ingrained in modern society, from plastics to transportation fuels. Many industries and individuals rely heavily on these products, making it difficult to completely phase them out. As a result, there may be resistance to environmental policies that aim to reduce petroleum use, as they could have significant economic and social impacts."}}
{"Q": "My phone is fully charged. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I can make calls now. (B) The phone can be used without electricity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I can make calls now.\nExplanation: When a phone is fully charged, it means that the battery has reached its maximum capacity and can provide power to the phone for a certain amount of time. This allows the user to make calls, send messages, use apps, and perform other functions without the phone shutting down due to low battery. However, the phone still requires electricity to function, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Teeth show one of their characteristics. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rodents have special teeth. (B) Humans are vertebrates.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Humans are vertebrates.\nExplanation: Teeth are one of the characteristics of vertebrates, which include humans. Rodents also have special teeth, but this is not the cause of teeth being a characteristic of all vertebrates. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John saw the criminal's face and told the police. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The police got the criminal. (B) The police got John.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The police got the criminal.\nExplanation: John's identification of the criminal's face would have helped the police in their investigation and search for the criminal. With this information, the police would have been able to track down and apprehend the criminal, leading to their arrest and prosecution. It is unlikely that John would have been arrested for reporting the criminal's face to the police, as this is a helpful action in solving a crime. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom has many kinds of waterfowl in his farm. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His hatchery can produce hundreds of millions of fertilized eggs every year. (B) Tom needs to prepare a variety of different feeds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom needs to prepare a variety of different feeds.\nExplanation: Having many kinds of waterfowl in his farm means that each species may have different dietary requirements. Therefore, Tom needs to prepare a variety of different feeds to ensure that each species gets the necessary nutrients for their growth and health. While it is possible that his hatchery can produce a large number of fertilized eggs, it is not necessarily a direct result of having many kinds of waterfowl in his farm."}}
{"Q": "He was forced by the landlord to do something. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is a relative to the landlord. (B) He is a slave to the landlord's family.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer. \nExplanation: The question does not provide enough information to determine the cause of why the landlord forced him to do something. It could be due to a variety of reasons such as a contractual obligation, a violation of lease terms, or a dispute between the two parties. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assume that he is a relative or a slave without any evidence."}}
{"Q": "He no longer has the ownership interest of the business enterprise. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My husband owes a lot debts. (B) The boss made over all his equity in the company.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The boss made over all his equity in the company.\nExplanation: This option suggests that the reason for the loss of ownership interest was due to the boss transferring all of his equity in the company to someone else. This is a plausible explanation as it is common for business owners to transfer their ownership to others for various reasons such as retirement, partnership changes, or selling the business. Option (A) is also a possibility, but it is not as specific and could be due to a variety of factors beyond just owing debts."}}
{"Q": "There are a lot of carbon dioxide around it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plastic was decompsed. (B) This village is beside a estuary.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This village is beside an estuary.\nExplanation: Estuaries are known to have high levels of carbon dioxide due to the decomposition of organic matter in the water. This can lead to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air surrounding the estuary. Therefore, it is more plausible that the high levels of carbon dioxide around the village are due to its proximity to an estuary rather than the decomposition of plastic."}}
{"Q": "Mary wants to have a localized massage on her hands. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor tells her to do acupressure. (B) Mary explained that she was explaining causes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor tells her to do acupressure.\nExplanation: Since Mary wants a localized massage on her hands, the doctor may suggest acupressure as it involves applying pressure to specific points on the body, which can help relieve tension and pain in the hands. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which does not seem to be related to Mary's request for a massage."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said she had an aging placenta. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The examination data showed severe calcification. (B) The duck was sick.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The examination data showed severe calcification.\nExplanation: Severe calcification is a common cause of an aging placenta. As the placenta ages, it can become less efficient at providing nutrients and oxygen to the developing fetus, which can lead to complications during pregnancy and delivery. Calcification occurs when calcium deposits build up in the placenta, causing it to harden and become less flexible. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including maternal age, high blood pressure, and smoking. In contrast, there is no logical connection between a sick duck and an aging placenta in a human pregnancy."}}
{"Q": "The government considers different environmental consequences. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The government wants to make new laws to protect the wild life. (B) The citizens hope the government can build more ways.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The government wants to make new laws to protect the wild life.\nExplanation: Considering environmental consequences is often a part of creating new laws and regulations to protect the environment and wildlife. Building more ways, as mentioned in option B, may have environmental consequences, but it is not a direct cause for the government to consider environmental consequences. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I saw swift shadows. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Peregrines passed my sight. (B) I jumped on the trampoline.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Peregrines passed my sight.\nExplanation: Swift shadows are often associated with birds of prey, such as peregrine falcons, as they are known for their fast and agile flight. Therefore, it is more plausible that the swift shadows were caused by peregrines passing by rather than jumping on a trampoline."}}
{"Q": "He picked up a lot of seashells. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has swum in the sea. (B) Tom wants to collect some remains of marine invertebrates.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom picked up a lot of seashells suggests that he has been in the sea and came across them while swimming or walking along the beach. Option B, which suggests that Tom is collecting remains of marine invertebrates, is less likely as it implies a specific purpose or interest in collecting seashells beyond simply encountering them while at the beach."}}
{"Q": "It ordered raw meat from the farm of cattles. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This hamburger restaurant ran out of meat. (B) The supplier has a lot raw meat to process.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This hamburger restaurant ran out of meat.\n\nExplanation: The fact that the restaurant ordered raw meat from a farm of cattles suggests that they were in urgent need of meat and did not have any in stock. If the supplier had a lot of raw meat to process, they would not necessarily need to order from a specific farm. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She saw that most stags are dark brown with a prick on their neck. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa went to the zoo and saw the stag. (B) After eating too much food, she had a stomache.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lisa went to the zoo and saw the stag.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Lisa saw most stags are dark brown with a prick on their neck. This suggests that Lisa observed stags in their natural habitat or in a controlled environment like a zoo. Option A is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the observation mentioned in the statement. Option B is irrelevant and does not explain the cause of the stag's appearance."}}
{"Q": "He is addicted to alcohol. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can't control his life. (B) He may die of alcohol poisoning.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Both (A) and (B) are plausible answers.\nExplanation: Alcohol addiction can have severe consequences on a person's life. They may lose control over their actions and decisions, leading to a lack of stability in their personal and professional life. Additionally, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to alcohol poisoning, which can be fatal. Therefore, both options are plausible outcomes of alcohol addiction."}}
{"Q": "He earned a lot of mony this season compared with last one. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He made a profit of three yuan. (B) His profit increased a lot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His profit increased a lot.\nExplanation: Since the statement mentions that he earned a lot of money compared to the previous season, it implies that his profit increased significantly. Option (A) stating that he made a profit of three yuan seems unlikely as it does not reflect a significant increase in earnings. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The bomb on the left exploded. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Deflation occurs. (B) The bomb next to it exploded too.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The bomb next to it exploded too.\nExplanation: If the bomb on the left exploded, it is likely that it was part of a larger set of bombs or explosives. The explosion of one bomb could trigger a chain reaction, causing other nearby bombs to explode as well. Therefore, it is more plausible that the bomb next to it also exploded rather than deflation occurring as a result of the explosion."}}
{"Q": "The doctor told William that his eyesight was gradually losing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor used radiotherapy to treat William. (B) The doctor said he might lose his sight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The doctor said he might lose his sight.\nExplanation: The doctor's statement indicates that William's eyesight is deteriorating and there is a possibility of complete loss of vision in the future. Radiotherapy is not a common treatment for gradual loss of eyesight, so option (A) is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor takes a blood test on her. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Courtney feels that she has a high level of carbon dioxide. (B) Courtney feels that she suffers from anemia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Courtney feels that she suffers from anemia.\nExplanation: Anemia is a condition where the body lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. A blood test can confirm the presence of anemia by measuring the levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells in the blood. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor took a blood test on Courtney to check for anemia, rather than a high level of carbon dioxide, which would require a different type of test."}}
{"Q": "The ground was scattered with decaying fish. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The air is full of the stink of decayed fish. (B) Dolphins there often get sick.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The air is full of the stink of decayed fish.\nExplanation: When fish decay, they release a strong odor that can spread through the air. This can make the surrounding area unpleasant to be in and can potentially attract scavengers or predators. While it is possible that dolphins in the area could get sick from eating the decaying fish, this is not necessarily a guaranteed result and is less likely than the strong odor affecting the air quality."}}
{"Q": "They follow this rule in every mine areas. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their company has laid down a series of mining rules. (B) The bat wants to make friend with the mosquito.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Their company has laid down a series of mining rules.\nExplanation: It is common for mining companies to establish safety protocols and regulations to ensure the well-being of their workers and the environment. Following rules in mine areas is crucial to prevent accidents, injuries, and damage to the mining site. Therefore, it is more plausible that the miners are following the rules set by their company rather than a bat wanting to make friends with a mosquito."}}
{"Q": "She bought various food containing proteins and so on. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The queen was hungry. (B) The lady hoped her poodle can have enough nutrients.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The lady hoped her poodle can have enough nutrients.\nExplanation: The mention of \"food containing proteins\" suggests that the lady was concerned about providing her poodle with a balanced diet that would meet its nutritional needs. It is unlikely that the queen's hunger would be the cause for buying food containing proteins and other nutrients."}}
{"Q": "He didn't know which version to follow. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom seached for relevant laws. (B) This machine lost its operator.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom searched for relevant laws.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person in question was unsure about which version to follow, indicating that there were multiple versions or options available. The cause of this confusion is given as Tom's search for relevant laws, which could have led to the discovery of multiple versions or interpretations of the same law or regulation. On the other hand, option B about a lost operator seems unrelated and less plausible in this context."}}
{"Q": "Peter exposed a live circuit to a changing magnetic field. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The state of the wire changes. (B) The sunlight was reflected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The state of the wire changes.\nExplanation: When a live circuit is exposed to a changing magnetic field, it induces an electric current in the wire. This can cause the wire to heat up, change its shape, or even melt. Therefore, the state of the wire changes due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the electric current. Option B, that sunlight was reflected, is not related to the scenario described in the question and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to the school lab and finished the studies. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted to do some studies. (B) Tom wrote a study on epiphytes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom wanted to do some studies.\nExplanation: This is the most plausible answer as it suggests that Tom had a personal motivation to go to the school lab and complete some studies. It does not rely on any external factors or requirements, such as a specific assignment or project. Additionally, the statement does not mention anything about Tom writing a study on epiphytes, so option B cannot be considered a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Explosives dissolve easily in water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The problem of invagination needs to be solved. (B) It difficult for scientists to extract the explosive molecules of explosives.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It is difficult for scientists to extract the explosive molecules of explosives.\n\nExplanation: Since explosives dissolve easily in water, it becomes challenging for scientists to extract the explosive molecules from the water. This can make it difficult to study the properties of explosives and develop new methods for their safe handling and disposal. Invagination, which refers to the process of folding inwards, is not related to the solubility of explosives in water and is therefore not a relevant factor in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Tom has suffered migraine for a long time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He felt dizzy yesterday. (B) He asked the doctor to gave him some depressants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom asked the doctor to give him some depressants as a result of suffering from migraines for a long time. Migraines can cause severe pain and discomfort, and individuals may seek medical treatment to alleviate their symptoms. However, dizziness is not a common symptom of migraines, so option A is less likely to be the result of Tom's condition."}}
{"Q": "They saw meerkats in South Africa. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They were surprised by the cold weather. (B) They were surprised by its unique patterns.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Nothing happened as a result of seeing meerkats in South Africa.\nExplanation: The statement only mentions the fact that they saw meerkats in South Africa, but it does not provide any information about any specific event or consequence that occurred as a result of this sighting. Therefore, it is more plausible to assume that nothing happened as a direct result of seeing the meerkats."}}
{"Q": "His foot was uncomfortable. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wore two left boots in the morning. (B) Tom was jogging on a hazy road.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's foot was uncomfortable because he was jogging on a hazy road. Jogging on an uneven or rough surface can cause discomfort or pain in the feet, and the haze could have made it harder for Tom to see where he was stepping, increasing the likelihood of him stepping on something that caused discomfort. Wearing two left boots would be an unlikely scenario and would likely cause more than just discomfort in one foot."}}
{"Q": "He analysed the composition of the soil. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He discovered many different elements. (B) Stratification is formed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He discovered many different elements.\nExplanation: When someone analyses the composition of soil, they typically use various methods to determine the presence and quantity of different elements and compounds in the soil. This can include testing for things like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, among others. As a result of this analysis, the person may discover that the soil contains many different elements, which can help them understand the soil's properties and potential uses. Stratification, on the other hand, refers to the layering of different materials in a soil profile, which is not necessarily related to the analysis of soil composition."}}
{"Q": "Overloading has caused serious consequences. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He directly make deals with clients. (B) There are rules for penalizing such consequences.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Overloading can lead to various negative consequences such as decreased productivity, increased stress and burnout, and compromised quality of work. In order to prevent such consequences, many organizations have established rules and policies for penalizing employees who engage in overloading. These penalties may include warnings, reprimands, or even termination of employment in severe cases. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it highlights the measures taken to address the negative consequences of overloading. Option A, on the other hand, does not provide a clear explanation of how overloading has caused serious consequences."}}
{"Q": "He was elected as officals in his county. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike is a worker. (B) Mike is a sheriff.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Mike is a sheriff.\nExplanation: Being a sheriff is a more plausible reason for being elected as an official in a county than simply being a worker. Sheriffs are law enforcement officers who are responsible for maintaining law and order in their jurisdiction, and they often have a significant amount of influence and authority in their communities. As such, it is not uncommon for sheriffs to be elected to other positions of power and responsibility within their counties."}}
{"Q": "These plots are full of wheat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has many adjacent plots. (B) Tom can't farm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has many adjacent plots.\nExplanation: If Tom has many adjacent plots, it is likely that he is a successful farmer and has planted wheat in all of his plots. This would explain why the plots are full of wheat. On the other hand, if Tom can't farm, it is unlikely that he would have so many plots full of wheat. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The test showed that the deeper tissue has got the nourishment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wiped those nourishment on the tissue. (B) They analyzed the cartilage.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They analyzed the cartilage.\nExplanation: The deeper tissue being nourished suggests that the test involved analyzing the cartilage, which is located deeper in the body and receives nutrients through diffusion from surrounding tissues. Option (A) is not a plausible explanation as wiping nourishment on the tissue would not result in deeper tissue being nourished."}}
{"Q": "Larvaceans would handle more materials to make their houses more comfortable. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Larvaceans are growing every day. (B) Rebuilding the house is the only thing that larvaceans can do every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Larvaceans are filter-feeding animals that constantly pump water through their bodies to capture food particles. As they grow, they need to consume more food to sustain their metabolism and growth. This means they produce more waste and need to filter more water, which can clog their house filters. Therefore, larvaceans need to handle more materials to make their houses more comfortable and functional. Rebuilding the house every day would be too energy-intensive and not necessary for larvaceans to survive."}}
{"Q": "He is in debt now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom borrows money from his colleagues every day. (B) Tom borrowed a lot of money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Tom borrowed a lot of money, which could have led to his current debt situation. Option A, on the other hand, implies that Tom borrows money every day, but it does not necessarily mean that he is in debt because of it."}}
{"Q": "Lucy recently has a diet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She usually eats Hamburgs. (B) She eats a lot of fruit instead of rice .", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She eats a lot of fruit instead of rice.\nExplanation: Since Lucy recently started a diet, it is more plausible that she would change her eating habits and opt for healthier options such as fruits instead of rice. Eating hamburgers, as mentioned in option A, would not be consistent with a diet plan."}}
{"Q": "His sensory organ developed very well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This boy was provided with enough toys in his childhood. (B) She had the symptom of apnea.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This boy was provided with enough toys in his childhood.\nExplanation: Sensory development is influenced by environmental factors, including exposure to different stimuli and experiences. Providing a child with enough toys and opportunities to explore their environment can help promote the development of their sensory organs. On the other hand, apnea, which is a breathing disorder, is not directly related to sensory organ development."}}
{"Q": "Trogons built their home in a cavities. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Trogons are good at finding cavities. (B) Trogons do not build nests.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Trogons are good at finding cavities.\n\nExplanation: Trogons have adapted to living in forested areas where there are many trees with natural cavities. They have evolved to be able to find and use these cavities as their homes, rather than building nests from scratch. This adaptation allows them to conserve energy and resources, as well as provide a safe and secure home for their young. Therefore, it is more plausible that trogons are good at finding cavities rather than not building nests at all."}}
{"Q": "They all just grow corn. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) These fields are very dry. (B) This field is all monoculture.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Monoculture refers to the practice of growing only one type of crop in a particular area. This can be due to various reasons such as economic benefits, ease of management, or lack of knowledge about crop rotation. In this case, the fact that all the fields are growing only corn suggests that the farmers are practicing monoculture. The dryness of the fields may also be a contributing factor, but it is not the primary cause for the uniformity of the crop."}}
{"Q": "They have different functions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A large number of small bees live in hives. (B) There are many paths in the park.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the bees have different functions, which implies that they have specialized roles within their hive. This is a common characteristic of social insects like bees, where individuals have specific tasks such as foraging, caring for young, or defending the colony. Therefore, option A, which suggests that a large number of small bees live in hives, is a more plausible answer as it aligns with the known behavior of bees. Option B, which talks about paths in a park, is not related to the statement and does not provide a logical explanation for the different functions of bees."}}
{"Q": "Tom's body is deficient in protein. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor advised him to eat more lean pork. (B) Tom likes eating bananas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor advised him to eat more lean pork.\nExplanation: Protein is an essential nutrient for the body, and its deficiency can lead to various health problems. To overcome this deficiency, the doctor would recommend increasing the intake of protein-rich foods like lean pork, chicken, fish, eggs, etc. Bananas are not a good source of protein, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "These membranes are permeable. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It can catch these waves more easily. (B) Exchanges can occur across them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Exchanges can occur across them.\nExplanation: If a membrane is permeable, it means that substances can pass through it. In the case of biological membranes, this allows for exchanges of molecules and ions between different compartments or environments. For example, the permeability of cell membranes allows nutrients to enter the cell and waste products to exit, while also regulating the balance of ions and other molecules inside and outside the cell. In the context of sensory organs, such as the ear or the eye, the permeability of certain membranes can also affect the detection and transmission of signals, but this is not directly related to catching waves more easily."}}
{"Q": "Every one in the audience region is weeping or crying. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Iron man is dying. (B) Tom's workers are on strike.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Iron man is dying.\nExplanation: Iron man is a beloved superhero character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If he were to die in a movie or TV show, it would likely elicit an emotional response from fans and viewers. On the other hand, Tom's workers being on strike may cause concern or frustration, but it is unlikely to cause widespread weeping or crying in an audience region."}}
{"Q": "The doctor found the level of carbon dioxide was too high. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She had a blood routine examination. (B) The researcher inflated some carbon dioxide into the liquid.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) She had a blood routine examination.\nExplanation: During a blood routine examination, the doctor measures the levels of various gases in the blood, including carbon dioxide. If the level of carbon dioxide is found to be too high, it could indicate a problem with the patient's respiratory system, such as hypoventilation or lung disease. In contrast, option (B) is unlikely to be the cause of high carbon dioxide levels in a patient's blood, as inflating carbon dioxide into a liquid would not affect the patient's respiratory system."}}
{"Q": "John wanted to raise a semi-hardy perennial. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He collect durable wood. (B) He raised buttercups.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He raised buttercups.\nExplanation: A semi-hardy perennial is a plant that can survive in colder temperatures but may need some protection during harsh winters. Buttercups are a type of semi-hardy perennial that can be easily grown in gardens. Therefore, it is more plausible that John raised buttercups as a result of wanting to grow a semi-hardy perennial. Collecting durable wood would not be related to raising a plant."}}
{"Q": "A lady needed twigs to make an art work. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She took the scissors to cut the shrubs. (B) The lady's desire was aroused.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the lady took the scissors to cut the shrubs, as she needed twigs for her art work. This is a logical and practical solution to her problem. Option B, that her desire was aroused, is not a likely outcome based on the information given in the question."}}
{"Q": "John is looking in the mirror. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom can see Mary standing behind the mirror. (B) He found his eyes blue.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He found his eyes blue.\nExplanation: When John looks in the mirror, he is likely to see his own reflection. It is possible that he may notice something about himself that he had not previously realized, such as the color of his eyes. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) is not likely as it suggests that Tom can see Mary standing behind the mirror, which is not possible as mirrors reflect the image in front of them."}}
{"Q": "He decided to buy some hemlocks. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The house owner wanted some trees inside his house. (B) Tom used a thermometer to mearsure his temperature.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The house owner wanted some trees inside his house.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"he\" decided to buy some hemlocks, but it does not specify who \"he\" is. However, the sentence implies that the decision was made by someone who has the ability to buy trees, which suggests that it is the house owner. Additionally, the fact that the trees are hemlocks implies that they are intended for outdoor use, which would not make sense if the decision was made by Tom to measure his temperature with a thermometer. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the decision was the house owner's desire to have some trees inside his house."}}
{"Q": "The house was on fire and the people needed water to put it out. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The water in it remained cool. (B) People came to the bay.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) People came to the bay.\nExplanation: In a situation where a house is on fire and people need water to put it out, it is likely that they would go to the nearest source of water, which in this case would be the bay. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer. Option (A) is not relevant to the situation and does not make sense."}}
{"Q": "He was confused when he faced options. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He later suffered from neurosis. (B) He was confused about which career path to choose.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: When faced with multiple options, it is common to feel confused about which path to choose. This confusion can lead to indecision and uncertainty, but it is unlikely to result in neurosis, which is a more severe mental disorder. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a petrologist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom studies rocks as his analysis. (B) He can only sing in falsetto.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom studies rocks as his analysis.\nExplanation: As a petrologist, Tom's area of expertise is the study of rocks, including their composition, structure, and formation. This profession does not have any correlation with his ability to sing in falsetto, making option B an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I turn to the technology of my colleges. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I have difficulty checking all the machines. (B) I need a yottabytes of memory.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the speaker is having difficulty checking all the machines, which implies that they are responsible for maintaining or monitoring multiple devices. Turning to the technology of their colleagues could mean seeking assistance or support from others who are more knowledgeable or experienced in this area. On the other hand, the second option of needing a yottabytes of memory seems unlikely as it is an extremely large amount of data storage and not a common requirement for most tasks."}}
{"Q": "Beets dosen't grow well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather is hot throughout this year. (B) The water is hot throughout this year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The weather is hot throughout this year.\nExplanation: Beets prefer cooler temperatures and can struggle to grow in hot weather. High temperatures can cause the plants to bolt (produce flowers and seeds prematurely) and can also lead to poor root development. In contrast, beets grow best in cooler temperatures between 60-65°F. Therefore, it is more likely that the hot weather was the cause of the poor beet growth rather than hot water."}}
{"Q": "The doctor diagnosed the spread of virus particles in the patient. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The patient was in a dangerous state. (B) The doctor found that there were on all epithelial surfaces.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The patient was in a dangerous state.\n\nExplanation: If the doctor diagnosed the spread of virus particles in the patient, it means that the virus has already spread throughout the body, which is a dangerous state for the patient. The spread of virus particles can lead to severe symptoms and complications, and the patient may require immediate medical attention and treatment. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B is not a likely outcome as it only describes the location of the virus particles, but does not provide any information about the patient's condition."}}
{"Q": "The worker was poisoned. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There is some waste. (B) The content of methanol in the new house overwhelmed the body's capacity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The content of methanol in the new house overwhelmed the body's capacity.\nExplanation: Methanol is a toxic substance that can cause serious health problems, including blindness and death, if ingested or inhaled in large amounts. If the worker was poisoned, it is more likely that the cause was the high content of methanol in the new house, rather than some waste. Methanol can be found in many household products, including cleaning agents, solvents, and fuels, and it is possible that the worker was exposed to it while working in the new house."}}
{"Q": "He found some dysprosium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He explored the metal coating of halogen lamps. (B) Sam camped out in the woods at night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He explored the metal coating of halogen lamps.\nExplanation: Dysprosium is a rare earth element that is commonly used in the metal coating of halogen lamps. Therefore, it is more plausible that he found dysprosium while exploring the metal coating of halogen lamps rather than while camping out in the woods at night."}}
{"Q": "Tony wanted to buy some food. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought one hamburger in a McDonald's store. (B) The servers bring what he wants to eat in the restaurant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He bought one hamburger in a McDonald's store.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Tony's desire to buy food. Option B is not necessarily a guaranteed outcome of wanting to buy food, as Tony could have chosen to cook at home or order takeout instead of going to a restaurant. Option A is a more specific and likely outcome of Tony's desire to buy food, as he could have easily gone to a McDonald's store and purchased a hamburger."}}
{"Q": "He grew up and became a well-known jeweler. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom also has wrinkles at thirties. (B) He created a lot of fine jewelry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He created a lot of fine jewelry.\nExplanation: The sentence states that he became a well-known jeweler, which implies that he was successful in his profession. Therefore, it is more plausible that he created a lot of fine jewelry as a result of his success rather than having wrinkles at a young age."}}
{"Q": "They have a strong desire to drink water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ticks is sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals. (B) Those men are hikers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that those men are hikers and have been exerting themselves, causing them to become thirsty and have a strong desire to drink water. Ticks being sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals is not relevant to the given statement."}}
{"Q": "Barometers are needed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We have to measure its responsiveness. (B) Air pressure should be measured.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Air pressure should be measured.\nExplanation: Barometers are instruments used to measure air pressure. This is important in weather forecasting, aviation, and other fields where changes in air pressure can have significant effects. Therefore, the need for barometers is primarily driven by the need to measure air pressure accurately. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not provide a clear reason for why barometers are needed."}}
{"Q": "A group of thiefs were caught. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They returned home. (B) They handed in the stolen things.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They handed in the stolen things.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the thieves would be required to return the stolen items as part of their punishment or as a condition for leniency. Returning home without consequences would not be a realistic outcome for criminal behavior."}}
{"Q": "He composted the soil. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He used it as a water container. (B) The pH of the soil gradually balances out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The pH of the soil gradually balances out.\nExplanation: Composting soil involves adding organic matter to it, which helps to improve its structure and fertility. As the organic matter breaks down, it releases nutrients into the soil, which can help to balance out the pH levels. This can lead to healthier plants and better crop yields. Using composted soil as a water container (choice A) is not a common practice and would not be a likely result of composting soil."}}
{"Q": "It is normal, what it eats have enough water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My grasshopper did not drink the water I prepared. (B) Green tea is a typical catabolic food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Grasshoppers require water to survive, and if they do not drink the water provided, they may become dehydrated and suffer health problems. Therefore, if the grasshopper is not drinking the water provided, it is likely the cause of its lack of water intake. Green tea being a catabolic food has no direct relation to the grasshopper's water intake."}}
{"Q": "The machine has some functions similar to the human minds. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It can identify some obvious patterns. (B) All signal transduction pathways can fulfill that function.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the machine has some functions similar to the human mind, which implies that it may have some level of cognitive abilities. One of the basic cognitive abilities is pattern recognition, which allows humans to identify and categorize information based on similarities and differences. Therefore, it is plausible that the machine can identify some obvious patterns, but it is unlikely that all signal transduction pathways can fulfill that function as it is a specific cognitive ability."}}
{"Q": "The fuel compression was done. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom put carbon monoxide together with compounds. (B) Tom squeezed all the fuel with the machine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom squeezed all the fuel with the machine.\nExplanation: Fuel compression is the process of reducing the volume of fuel to increase its pressure. This is typically done using a machine that squeezes the fuel, which is the most plausible explanation given in option (B). Option (A) is not a likely cause of fuel compression, as carbon monoxide is a toxic gas and not typically used in fuel compression processes."}}
{"Q": "John observes the way animals breathe. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She observed them carefully. (B) He saw the diaphragm contract as the rabbit inhaled.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The sentence states that John observed the way animals breathe, and then specifically mentions that he saw the diaphragm contract as the rabbit inhaled. This suggests that John was actively observing and paying attention to the details of the animals' breathing patterns, rather than simply watching them passively. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer than option A."}}
{"Q": "My family called it toy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I bred this tiny dog as my pet. (B) I have witnessed their hospitality.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I bred this tiny dog as my pet.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the family called the dog a toy because it was a small breed that was bred specifically as a pet. This is a common term used for small dogs like Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, and Yorkshire Terriers. Witnessing hospitality (choice B) does not seem to be related to the dog being called a toy."}}
{"Q": "The prey got into its mouth. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The frogfish rushed to its prey. (B) The lizard met its prey.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The frogfish rushed to its prey.\nExplanation: Frogfish are known for their ability to rapidly expand their mouths to suck in prey. This is a common hunting technique for frogfish, and it is likely that the prey was caught in this manner rather than a lizard meeting its prey."}}
{"Q": "His friend yelled tom stepped in Crevasses. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom and his friend went to the church last Sunday. (B) Tom stepped in narrow deep cracks in the glacier.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom stepped in narrow deep cracks in the glacier.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that Tom stepped in crevasses, which are narrow deep cracks in a glacier. Option (A) about going to church is irrelevant and does not explain the cause of Tom stepping in crevasses. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The list shows that you used much water last month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They appear in summer and autumn. (B) I cleaned my whole house in and out during last month.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Using a lot of water in a month could result in a higher water bill or a decrease in the water supply. Option A is not related to the question and does not provide a plausible explanation for the consequences of using a lot of water. Option B, on the other hand, provides a more reasonable explanation as cleaning the whole house in and out would require a significant amount of water usage."}}
{"Q": "It manages occurrence of data. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He organized the data into tables. (B) This special organization is in charge of tracking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: By organizing the data into tables, it becomes easier to manage and track the occurrence of data. Tables provide a structured way to store and retrieve data, making it more efficient to manage and analyze. Therefore, organizing the data into tables is a plausible cause for managing the occurrence of data."}}
{"Q": "Synthetic resin smells toxic when burned. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's clothes made of polyester smell poisonous when burned. (B) The doctor suggested citizens to take some delarvirdines.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Synthetic resin is commonly used in the production of polyester, which is a type of synthetic fabric. When burned, polyester emits a toxic smell due to the chemicals used in its production. Therefore, it is plausible that Tom's clothes made of polyester would smell poisonous when burned. On the other hand, there is no apparent connection between the burning of synthetic resin and the doctor's suggestion of taking delarvirdines, which is a medication used to treat HIV."}}
{"Q": "Many insects are eaten by them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are many sparrows in the orchard. (B) Human beings need nutritious food for their survival.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Insects are a good source of protein and other nutrients, and many animals, including humans, rely on them as a food source. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of animals eating insects is due to their need for nutritious food rather than the presence of sparrows in the orchard."}}
{"Q": "He was bit by wasps. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He studies plants. (B) He felt very painful.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He felt very painful.\nExplanation: When someone is bitten by wasps, it is common to experience pain, swelling, and redness at the site of the sting. In some cases, people may also experience an allergic reaction, which can cause more severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, hives, and swelling of the face and throat. However, based on the given choices, the most plausible answer is that he felt very painful as a result of the wasp bites."}}
{"Q": "The baby bike could not bear his weight. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My baby became a teenager. (B) My baby became much thinner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) My baby became much thinner.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the baby bike could not bear his weight, which implies that the baby has lost weight. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as becoming a teenager would not cause the baby bike to not bear his weight. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely cause of the problem."}}
{"Q": "I found its interest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I had a hobby. (B) I had a budgie.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Having a hobby is a more plausible reason for developing an interest in something than having a pet bird. While having a pet bird may be enjoyable, it is unlikely to directly cause someone to develop an interest in a particular topic or activity. On the other hand, having a hobby that involves a particular subject or activity can lead to a deeper interest and engagement with that topic."}}
{"Q": "Tom is an engineer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom designed different kinds of buildings. (B) He studies different kinds of structures.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom designed different kinds of buildings.\nExplanation: As an engineer, Tom's primary job is to design and create structures such as buildings, bridges, and roads. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would design different kinds of buildings as a result of being an engineer. While studying different kinds of structures is also a part of an engineer's job, it is not the direct result of being an engineer."}}
{"Q": "They are like living creatures. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Those dolls look exactly like people. (B) The clocks are moving all the time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The statement \"They are like living creatures\" suggests that the dolls have a lifelike appearance or behavior. Choice A, \"Those dolls look exactly like people,\" is a more plausible explanation for this statement than choice B, \"The clocks are moving all the time,\" which does not relate to the dolls' lifelike qualities."}}
{"Q": "He prevented it from harm of mealybugs with great efforts. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The gardener was hired to take care of my poinsettias. (B) He removed the ligaments.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The gardener was hired to take care of my poinsettias.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the gardener prevented harm from mealybugs, which suggests that the gardener was hired to take care of the poinsettias and took measures to protect them from pests. Option B, which suggests that ligaments were removed, is not relevant to the context and does not make sense in this sentence."}}
{"Q": "It turned out to be dynamics. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom searched the Internet for the nature of loudness of an instrument. (B) Tommy's wheel was making a strange noise.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Dynamics refers to the variation in volume or intensity of sound. The fact that Tommy's wheel was making a strange noise suggests that there was some kind of variation in the sound it was producing, which could be described as dynamics. On the other hand, Tom searching the internet for the nature of loudness of an instrument does not necessarily suggest any kind of variation in sound, and therefore is less likely to be the cause of dynamics."}}
{"Q": "The editor has left a special page for national news. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This staff is good at arranging pages to be printed on the press. (B) It is important for people to know important events of the country every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The fact that the editor left a special page for national news suggests that they believe it is important for people to know about important events happening in the country on a daily basis. This is a common practice in news organizations, as national news often has a significant impact on people's lives and is therefore considered a priority. Option A may be true, but it does not explain why the editor specifically left a special page for national news."}}
{"Q": "Tom was infected with pneumonia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The bacteria in his body became resistant to antibiotics. (B) Tom's family was worried about him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom's family was worried about him.\nExplanation: Pneumonia is a serious infection that can cause symptoms such as coughing, fever, and difficulty breathing. It can be life-threatening, especially for young children, elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems. Therefore, it is natural for Tom's family to be worried about his health and well-being. Option A is not a plausible answer because antibiotic resistance is a gradual process that occurs over time and is not an immediate consequence of a single infection."}}
{"Q": "Tom fails the blood test. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has just had a wine. (B) Tom drew some blood to check his body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has just had a wine.\nExplanation: Consuming alcohol before a blood test can affect the results, especially if the test is for liver function or blood sugar levels. Alcohol can also interfere with the accuracy of certain blood tests, such as those for triglycerides and cholesterol. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's failure in the blood test was caused by his recent consumption of wine."}}
{"Q": "They climbed up to the peak of the hill. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have made holes in a steep slope that used to be thickly vegetated. (B) They felt the climate much colder than that at the foot of the hill.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They felt the climate much colder than that at the foot of the hill.\nExplanation: As they climbed up to the peak of the hill, they would have gained altitude, which generally results in a decrease in temperature. This is because the air becomes thinner at higher altitudes, and therefore, it cannot hold as much heat. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would have felt the climate much colder than that at the foot of the hill rather than making holes in a steep slope that used to be thickly vegetated."}}
{"Q": "Tattoos can keep its color for a long time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I benefied from long term hair removal. (B) Color in a relatively permanent skin layer like the dermis would not fade soon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Tattoos are made by injecting ink into the dermis layer of the skin, which is relatively permanent compared to the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). The ink particles are too large to be absorbed by the body's immune system, so they remain in the dermis layer and keep their color for a long time. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) is not related to the longevity of tattoo color."}}
{"Q": "Kate's doctor prescribed a drug containing zinc. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kate is ill and will be treated. (B) Kate is suffering from thermal hyperalgesia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kate is ill and will be treated.\nExplanation: Zinc is commonly used to treat various illnesses, such as the common cold, pneumonia, and diarrhea. It is also used to boost the immune system and promote wound healing. Therefore, it is more plausible that Kate's doctor prescribed the drug containing zinc to treat her illness rather than for thermal hyperalgesia, which is a condition characterized by increased sensitivity to heat."}}
{"Q": "Some of the leaves on Tom's potted plants are getting old and dying. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are mildew spots on some leaves. (B) Tom finds that the leaves has been eaten after a while.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There are mildew spots on some leaves.\nExplanation: When leaves on a plant start to die, it can create a moist environment that is conducive to the growth of mildew. Mildew is a type of fungus that can cause white or gray spots to appear on the leaves. This is a common occurrence when plants are not properly cared for or when they are exposed to too much moisture. Therefore, it is more plausible that the old and dying leaves on Tom's potted plants have developed mildew spots."}}
{"Q": "Tom draws graphics by drawing pixels. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is from Brazil. (B) Tom wants to draw a digital image.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Drawing pixels is a common technique used in digital art and graphic design. It allows for precise control over the placement and color of individual pixels, which is necessary for creating high-quality digital images. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom draws graphics by drawing pixels because he wants to create a digital image, rather than because of his nationality."}}
{"Q": "She can heal small animals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The witch had telekinesis. (B) She is a witch.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: She is a witch.\nExplanation: In many fictional stories and folklore, witches are often portrayed as having magical abilities, including the power to heal or cure ailments. Therefore, it is more plausible that the witch's ability to heal small animals is due to her being a witch rather than having telekinesis, which is the ability to move objects with one's mind."}}
{"Q": "Kur is using a microscope to observe the growth of pollen tubes from the surface of pollen grains. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kur named it germination. (B) He drew some alkanes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Kur named it germination.\nExplanation: Germination refers to the process of a seed or spore beginning to grow and develop into a new plant. In the case of pollen grains, the growth of pollen tubes from the surface of the grain is a crucial step in the fertilization process. Therefore, it is plausible that Kur would use the term germination to describe this process. Drawing alkanes, on the other hand, is not related to the observation of pollen tube growth and would not be a likely result of using a microscope for this purpose."}}
{"Q": "Lucy didn't deliver a live baby. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy has suffered form infertility. (B) Lucy kept smoking while pregnant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy has suffered from infertility.\nExplanation: Infertility is a medical condition that can prevent a woman from getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term. It can be caused by various factors such as hormonal imbalances, structural problems in the reproductive system, or genetic disorders. Smoking during pregnancy can increase the risk of complications, but it is not the only cause of infertility. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The visibility was lower. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There was a light rain in the polluted city. (B) The mountain is very humid due to frequent rains.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There was a light rain in the polluted city.\nExplanation: When it rains in a polluted city, the rainwater mixes with the pollutants in the air, creating a haze that reduces visibility. This is a common phenomenon known as \"acid rain.\" On the other hand, humidity in the mountains does not necessarily cause reduced visibility unless there are other factors such as fog or mist. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The building is of low visibility in fog. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Harvesters have their hands protected during harvesting time. (B) It can only be seen to a low degree.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It can only be seen to a low degree.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the building has low visibility in fog, which means that it cannot be seen clearly. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the building can only be seen to a low degree. Option A, which talks about harvesters having their hands protected during harvesting time, is not related to the given sentence and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "These adolescent boys haven't had any relationships yet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Masturbation never occurs. (B) Masturbation occurs frequently.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Masturbation occurs frequently.\nExplanation: It is a natural and common behavior for adolescents to explore their own bodies and experience sexual arousal through masturbation, regardless of whether they have had any relationships or not. Therefore, it is more plausible that these boys would engage in masturbation frequently rather than not at all."}}
{"Q": "Tom chooses kiwi to collect fructose. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Food was used to treat my disease. (B) Tom wants to collect fructose.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom wants to collect fructose.\nExplanation: The question clearly states that Tom chose kiwi to collect fructose, indicating that he had a specific purpose in mind. Option A, which suggests that Tom used food to treat a disease, is not relevant to the given information. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom goes to evergreen forest to find the bird. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to see a giraffe. (B) Tom wants to take photos of kinglets.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Tom's desire to take photos of kinglets is a more plausible reason for him to go to the evergreen forest than wanting to see a giraffe. Giraffes are not typically found in forests, and it is unlikely that Tom would go to a forest specifically to see one. On the other hand, kinglets are small birds that are commonly found in forests, and it makes sense that a photographer like Tom would want to capture their images."}}
{"Q": "Mother pointed out Bob's mistake and said that birds can't masticate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob told his mother that the bird was masticating happily. (B) Bob told his mother that birds can fly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Bob's mistake was telling his mother that the bird was masticating, which means chewing and grinding food with teeth. However, birds do not have teeth and therefore cannot masticate. This caused his mother to point out his mistake and correct him. Option B, which states that Bob told his mother that birds can fly, is not related to the mistake of mastication and therefore is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He uses slits as devices. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wants to control noise. (B) Tom is polymerizing the modules.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He wants to control noise.\n\nExplanation: By using slits as devices, Tom is likely trying to control the amount of noise that is produced by his modules. Slits can act as filters, allowing certain frequencies to pass through while blocking others. This can help to reduce unwanted noise and create a clearer, more focused sound. On the other hand, option B (Tom polymerizing the modules) does not seem to be related to the use of slits as devices."}}
{"Q": "His mental development is slower than that of his peers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Peter had a serious illness when he was a baby. (B) Tom eats too much food containing lipids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Peter had a serious illness when he was a baby.\nExplanation: Serious illnesses during infancy can lead to developmental delays, including delays in mental development. This is because the brain is still developing rapidly during the first few years of life, and any disruptions or damage can have long-lasting effects on cognitive abilities. On the other hand, there is no direct link between consuming food containing lipids and slower mental development. While a diet high in saturated fats can have negative effects on overall health, it is not a direct cause of developmental delays."}}
{"Q": "Its is possible for text-to-speech process in different languages. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man invented speech resynthesis. (B) Cochlear implant is a common implant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The man invented speech resynthesis.\nExplanation: Text-to-speech technology is based on speech resynthesis, which involves analyzing and synthesizing human speech. The development of speech resynthesis technology has made it possible to create text-to-speech systems in different languages. This technology has been developed by researchers and engineers over many years, and it involves complex algorithms and models that can analyze and synthesize speech in different languages. Cochlear implants, on the other hand, are devices that are used to help people with hearing loss, and they do not play a role in text-to-speech technology. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The magezing is classified as pornographic magazine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom goes for a walk outside in the cold winter. (B) The magazine has pictures of naked girls.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The magazine being classified as pornographic is most likely due to the fact that it contains pictures of naked girls, which is a common characteristic of pornographic material. Going for a walk in the cold winter has no relevance to the classification of the magazine."}}
{"Q": "Ability of chemically interacting with many other substances indicates chemical instability. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Phenols has chemical instability. (B) Acetylene is prone to undergo addition reaction with many substances.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Acetylene is prone to undergo addition reaction with many substances.\n\nExplanation: The ability of a substance to chemically interact with many other substances indicates that it is reactive and can undergo chemical reactions easily. This reactivity is a sign of chemical instability. Acetylene is a highly reactive compound and can undergo addition reactions with many substances, such as halogens, hydrogen, and water. This reactivity makes it useful in various industrial processes, but it also makes it potentially dangerous if not handled properly. Phenols, on the other hand, are relatively stable compounds and do not undergo many chemical reactions. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The explorer wore crampons in climbing the snow mountain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He successfully climbed to the top of the mountain with the spikes on the soles. (B) The spike-soled boots helped him in climbing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He successfully climbed to the top of the mountain with the spikes on the soles.\nExplanation: Crampons are metal spikes that are attached to the soles of boots to provide better traction on snow and ice. Therefore, it is more plausible that the explorer was able to successfully climb to the top of the mountain with the help of the crampons. Option B is also correct, but it is not as specific as option A."}}
{"Q": "She tries different principles and solves them respectively. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary has to settle all the problems in these three modules. (B) Mary has some problems concerning the object as a whole.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Mary is trying different principles to solve problems, which implies that she is facing some difficulties or challenges related to the object as a whole. Therefore, option B seems to be a more plausible answer as it suggests that Mary has some problems concerning the object as a whole, rather than having to settle all the problems in these three modules (option A)."}}
{"Q": "He is very knowledgeable about movement. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His major is kinesiology. (B) Tom is a sociologist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If someone is knowledgeable about movement, it is likely that they have studied kinesiology, which is the scientific study of human movement. Therefore, choice (A) is a more plausible answer than choice (B), which is unrelated to the study of movement."}}
{"Q": "The multiplet volume increases rapidly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The occurrence of flocculation had an obvious influence. (B) There are a lot of channels.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: When the multiplet volume increases rapidly, it means that the particles are coming closer together and forming larger aggregates. This process is known as flocculation. As the particles come closer together, the attractive forces between them become stronger, leading to the formation of larger aggregates. Therefore, option A, which states that the occurrence of flocculation had an obvious influence, is a more plausible answer. Option B, which suggests that there are a lot of channels, is not a likely explanation for the rapid increase in multiplet volume."}}
{"Q": "He bought some equipment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Geophysicists trying to detect small movements in the Earth's crust appreaciated his invention. (B) He got some cloak devices.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Geophysicists trying to detect small movements in the Earth's crust appreciated his invention.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the equipment he bought was related to geophysics and had some innovative features that made it useful for detecting small movements in the Earth's crust. This would explain why geophysicists appreciated his invention as it would have helped them in their work. Option B, on the other hand, seems unlikely as it is not clear what \"cloak devices\" are and how they would be related to buying equipment."}}
{"Q": "This kingdom is rich in wines. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their  vines and bounty are envied by other kingdoms. (B) Their vines and bounty are envied by their king.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Their vines and bounty are envied by other kingdoms.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that other kingdoms would envy the wine production of this kingdom, rather than the king himself being envious. Wine is a valuable commodity and a source of wealth, so it is likely that neighboring kingdoms would desire to have a similar abundance of vines and wine production."}}
{"Q": "They orders fresh fruit from fruit stores. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The docter advices Lucy to eat fruits with much dietary fiber. (B) The restaurant sells Smoothies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Lucy and her colleagues ordered fresh fruit from fruit stores because Lucy's doctor advised her to eat fruits with much dietary fiber. This is a common recommendation for people who want to improve their digestive health and prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. It is unlikely that the restaurant selling smoothies would be the cause of this, as smoothies can be made with frozen fruit or fruit juice, which may not provide the same health benefits as fresh fruit."}}
{"Q": "The whole problem solving process was wrong. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The tutor failed to sum up the central topic. (B) Tom has listed a wrong equation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The tutor failed to sum up the central topic.\nExplanation: If the tutor failed to sum up the central topic, it is likely that the problem solving process was not focused on the correct problem or objective. This could have led to incorrect assumptions, wrong equations, and ultimately an incorrect solution. On the other hand, if Tom had listed a wrong equation, it would have been a specific mistake that could have been corrected during the problem solving process."}}
{"Q": "Scientists cut off the lateral roots of ragweed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ragweed is still vigorous. (B) The ragweed withered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Cutting off the lateral roots of ragweed would severely limit its ability to absorb water and nutrients from the soil, which would likely cause the plant to wither and eventually die. While ragweed is known for being a hardy and resilient plant, it still requires a certain level of root support to survive and thrive. Therefore, it is more plausible that the ragweed would wither rather than remain vigorous after having its lateral roots removed."}}
{"Q": "Lake wants to work out full hard glute. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She had collected a lot of fresh chopped apple juice in season. (B) Lake's fitness instructor asked him to practice lunge.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Lake's fitness instructor asked him to practice lunge.\nExplanation: Lunges are a great exercise for targeting the glutes, as well as the quads and hamstrings. By incorporating lunges into her workout routine, Lake can effectively work out her glutes and achieve her goal of a full hard glute. Option A about collecting fresh chopped apple juice is not related to the question and seems like a random statement."}}
{"Q": "Som oil was added to the carrier oil. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The carrier oil was diluted. (B) The mummy spilled oil.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The carrier oil was diluted.\nExplanation: When oil is added to a carrier oil, it mixes with the carrier oil and increases its volume. This results in the carrier oil being diluted, meaning that the concentration of the carrier oil is reduced. This is a common practice in aromatherapy, where essential oils are often added to carrier oils to dilute them and make them safe for use on the skin. On the other hand, there is no indication that the mummy spilled oil, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The Adhesives were exposed to oxygen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They hardened. (B) Oxidation occurred.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They hardened.\nExplanation: When adhesives are exposed to oxygen, they can undergo a process called polymerization, which causes them to harden and become more solid. This is because the oxygen molecules react with the adhesive molecules, causing them to link together and form a stronger bond. Oxidation can also occur, but it is less likely to be the primary cause of the hardening of adhesives."}}
{"Q": "He can't walk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is mentally handicapped. (B) Tom lost his legs before many years when he happened to a car accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom lost his legs before many years when he happened to a car accident. This would explain why he is unable to walk. Option A, that Tom is mentally handicapped, does not necessarily mean that he cannot walk."}}
{"Q": "The boy followed him slipped too. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boy can get adequate nutrition everyday. (B) A boy slipped on the ice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the boy slipped on the ice, as it directly relates to the action described in the sentence. The fact that the boy can get adequate nutrition everyday does not have any relevance to the situation described."}}
{"Q": "He is also equipped with a helmet for safety. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is going to buy a bicycle. (B) Tom felt very scared when he saw a monster.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom is going to buy a bicycle. Wearing a helmet is a common safety measure for cyclists to protect their head in case of accidents or falls. On the other hand, there is no indication in the sentence that Tom saw a monster or felt scared, so option B is unlikely."}}
{"Q": "This tree has great viability. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It has great potential to germinate. (B) It can get nourishment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It has great potential to germinate.\nExplanation: Viability refers to the ability of a seed or organism to survive and grow. In the context of a tree, great viability means that the tree's seeds have a high potential to germinate and grow into healthy trees. This could be due to factors such as good soil quality, adequate water supply, and favorable weather conditions. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer than option B, which only refers to the tree's ability to get nourishment."}}
{"Q": "Tom has some biluminescenes in the sea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found that there were some dinoflagellates. (B) He found that there were bromine atoms in it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He found that there were some dinoflagellates.\nExplanation: Bioluminescence in the sea is often caused by the presence of dinoflagellates, which are single-celled organisms that can produce light through a chemical reaction. Bromine atoms are not typically associated with bioluminescence in the sea, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "There was a swan in the office. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It presence was indicated. (B) The official got the beautiful feather.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Its presence was indicated.\nExplanation: It is highly unlikely that a swan would be found in an office setting, so its presence would be quite noticeable and likely to be indicated to others. It is not plausible that an official would simply take a feather from the swan without any further explanation or context."}}
{"Q": "It had been fifteen years since the aardwolf was born. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He need to consider the mass of neon inside this neon light. (B) It died before long.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It died before long.\nExplanation: Aardwolves have a lifespan of around 8-10 years in the wild and up to 15 years in captivity. Therefore, it is more plausible that the aardwolf mentioned in the question died before long rather than needing to consider the mass of neon inside a neon light, which is unrelated to the lifespan of an aardwolf."}}
{"Q": "The doctor found that his valve did not close when the heart contracted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Too much thyroxine was produced in the man's body. (B) There is something wrong with the patient's valve.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There is something wrong with the patient's valve.\nExplanation: The valve not closing properly indicates a malfunction in the valve itself, rather than an overproduction of thyroxine. Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland and is not directly related to the functioning of the heart valve. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jerry is allergic to lactose. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He may eat most unusual foods by mistake. (B) He may eat most usual milk by mistake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He may eat most usual milk by mistake.\nExplanation: Lactose is a sugar found in milk and dairy products. If Jerry is allergic to lactose, consuming milk or dairy products can cause him to experience symptoms such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Therefore, it is more plausible that he may accidentally consume milk or dairy products containing lactose, rather than unusual foods that may not contain lactose."}}
{"Q": "A pterosaur was running in the forest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) No one can run more fast than it. (B) He saw some ferns.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He saw some ferns.\nExplanation: Pterosaurs were flying reptiles and did not have the ability to run on land. Therefore, it is not possible for a pterosaur to run in the forest. Option B seems more plausible as it suggests that the pterosaur may have flown over the forest and spotted some ferns."}}
{"Q": "Tom was diagnosed with asexuality. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His wife felt he was ugly. (B) His wife has no sexual desire on him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His wife has no sexual desire on him.\nExplanation: Asexuality is a sexual orientation where a person does not experience sexual attraction towards anyone. It does not mean that the person is ugly or unattractive. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's wife has no sexual desire towards him because he is asexual."}}
{"Q": "The boys were trained with patterns. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They developed fixed habits. (B) Other boys followed to joint it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They developed fixed habits.\nExplanation: When someone is trained with patterns, they tend to repeat those patterns over and over again until they become habits. This is because patterns are repetitive actions that are learned through practice and repetition. Therefore, it is more plausible that the boys developed fixed habits as a result of their training with patterns. Option B is less likely as it does not necessarily follow that other boys would join in just because the first group was trained with patterns."}}
{"Q": "The leader of the orphanage decided to find a kind person for her to adopt her. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The orphan Lucy was sad when she saw a happy family. (B) Her mother abandoned her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the leader of the orphanage deciding to find a kind person to adopt Lucy was that her mother abandoned her. This is a more plausible answer as it is a common reason for children to end up in orphanages and for orphanage leaders to seek out adoptive parents for them. While it is possible that Lucy was sad when she saw a happy family, this alone would not be enough for the leader of the orphanage to take action to find her an adoptive family."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's trainer is both a teacher and friend. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She extremely likes her trainer. (B) They go to school together everyday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Since Lucy's trainer is both a teacher and friend, it is likely that Lucy has developed a strong bond with her trainer. Therefore, it is plausible that Lucy extremely likes her trainer. However, there is no indication that they go to school together everyday, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He fell asleep in a few minutes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was lying in the bed and reading a book. (B) Tom laid down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom laid down.\nExplanation: It is common for people to fall asleep quickly after lying down, especially if they are tired or have been active throughout the day. Reading a book may also make someone feel drowsy, but it is more likely that lying down was the main cause of Tom falling asleep in a few minutes."}}
{"Q": "He hence did unit tests. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom desired to know the scientific explanation of the word. (B) Developer Edward was asked to optimize the design.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person referred to as \"he\" performed unit tests, which are typically done by developers to ensure that their code works as intended. The reason for doing these tests is not explicitly stated, but the preceding sentence mentions a developer named Edward who was asked to optimize the design. It is therefore more likely that \"he\" (presumably another developer) did the unit tests in response to this request, rather than because of a desire to know the scientific explanation of a word."}}
{"Q": "Jack suffers from asthma. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Doctors diagnosed his son with asthma. (B) When he went to the hospital to do physical examination, his lung has been filled with shadow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Asthma is a respiratory condition that can cause inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty breathing. It is possible that Jack's asthma caused him to experience symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, which prompted him to seek medical attention. During a physical examination, doctors may have noticed abnormalities in his lung function or structure, such as shadows on an X-ray or CT scan. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to Jack's asthma and its impact on his health. Option A is not directly related to Jack's asthma and is therefore less likely to be the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom put a magnet near some coins. . What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The coins were attracted together by the magnet. . (B) The perveived bond closely ties them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The coins were attracted together by the magnet.\nExplanation: When a magnet is brought near metal objects, it can create a magnetic field that attracts the metal objects towards it. This is known as magnetic attraction. In this case, the coins are made of metal and when the magnet is brought near them, they will be attracted towards the magnet and may even stick to it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Too many activities have been hold in this city. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) More activities can be held. (B) Some residents were injured during these activities.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: When too many activities are held in a city, it can lead to overcrowding and increased risk of accidents or injuries. With more people and events happening, there may not be enough resources or safety measures in place to ensure everyone's well-being. Therefore, it is more plausible that some residents were injured during these activities."}}
{"Q": "The environment here is suitable for the family cercopithicidae. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are many mangabeys living here. (B) The coral reefs are growing well.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There are many mangabeys living here.\nExplanation: The family cercopithicidae includes several species of Old World monkeys, including mangabeys. If the environment is suitable for this family, it means that it provides the necessary resources and conditions for these monkeys to thrive. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result would be an increase in the population of mangabeys living in the area. On the other hand, coral reefs are not related to this family of monkeys, so it is less likely that their growth would be affected by the suitability of the environment for cercopithicidae."}}
{"Q": "The cloth was cut for oxygen to get in. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The acne bacteria was wet under thick water. (B) The acne bacteria was blocked under thick cloth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The acne bacteria was blocked under thick cloth.\n\nExplanation: The sentence states that the cloth was cut for oxygen to get in, which implies that something was being blocked or prevented from receiving oxygen. The sentence also mentions cloth, which suggests that the cause of the blockage was related to the cloth. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer as it suggests that the acne bacteria was blocked under thick cloth, which could have prevented oxygen from reaching it. Option (A) does not make sense in this context as it talks about the bacteria being wet under water, which is not mentioned in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "John found a dent in the ground. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The beaker was broken into pieces. (B) John put on his the reading glasses to see the ground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The dent in the ground is more likely to be caused by something heavy falling or being dropped, such as a beaker breaking into pieces, rather than John simply putting on his reading glasses to see the ground."}}
{"Q": "In addition to the daily food, I also put aquatic insects into merganser's nest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The next day I found the merganser starved to death. (B) The next day I found that the aquatic insects had been eaten.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more likely that the merganser ate the aquatic insects, as they are a natural part of their diet. It is unlikely that the merganser would starve to death overnight if it had been receiving daily food and additional insects."}}
{"Q": "A salesman visited her and recommend her some laundry detergents. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was impressed with the salesman’ politeness. (B) I couldn't help praising the visitors.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was impressed with the salesman's politeness.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the salesman recommended some laundry detergents to her. It does not mention anything about the quality of the detergents or whether she purchased them. However, it does mention that the salesman visited her and recommended the detergents, implying that he was polite and professional in his approach. Therefore, it is more plausible that she was impressed with his politeness rather than the speaker praising the visitor (which is not mentioned in the sentence)."}}
{"Q": "Some parasites lay their eggs on cloves. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A few days later the eggs died. (B) After a few days, the eggs turned into parasites.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) After a few days, the eggs turned into parasites.\nExplanation: Some parasites lay their eggs on cloves because they require a host to survive and reproduce. Once the eggs hatch, the larvae will feed on the host and develop into adult parasites. Therefore, it is more plausible that the eggs would turn into parasites rather than die a few days later."}}
{"Q": "He gave it back to the jockey. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom picked up a whip. (B) Tom collected some seawater.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom picked up a whip.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom picked up a whip and gave it back to the jockey, as jockeys use whips to urge their horses to run faster during races. On the other hand, collecting seawater does not seem to have any connection to the jockey or the horse race."}}
{"Q": "I began to look for the orioles hidden in it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I heard bird songs from green leaves. (B) I noticed that there are several caves dug by woodpeckers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is A because the statement mentions \"bird songs\" which indicates that the person heard the orioles singing. This is a common way to locate birds in nature. Option B, on the other hand, mentions \"caves dug by woodpeckers\" which is not directly related to finding orioles."}}
{"Q": "The workers have prepared some silts. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They plan to utilise them to build walls. (B) The gulls ate the meat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They plan to utilise them to build walls.\nExplanation: Since the workers have prepared the silts, it is more likely that they intend to use them for some purpose. Building walls is a common use for silts, as they can be mixed with other materials to create a sturdy structure. On the other hand, the second option of gulls eating meat seems unrelated and unlikely given the context."}}
{"Q": "She studies the relations among different creatures. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy majors in ecology. (B) The psycological expert is American.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy majors in ecology.\nExplanation: Ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisms and their environment. Therefore, it is plausible that Lucy's interest in studying the relations among different creatures is due to her majoring in ecology. On the other hand, the fact that the psychological expert is American is not relevant to the given statement and does not provide a plausible explanation for Lucy's interest in studying the relations among different creatures."}}
{"Q": "He found that adhesion had occurred. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The man looked at the areas. (B) He put the cells in contact with the surface.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Adhesion occurs when two surfaces come into contact with each other. Therefore, the most plausible cause of adhesion in this scenario is that the man put the cells in contact with the surface. Looking at the areas alone would not cause adhesion to occur."}}
{"Q": "A robin is hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It flies to the ground for food. (B) He measured the heart rate of the bird.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It flies to the ground for food.\nExplanation: When a robin is hungry, it will typically fly down to the ground to search for food, such as worms or insects. This is a natural behavior for birds when they are in need of sustenance. Option B, measuring the heart rate of the bird, is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the robin's hunger or behavior."}}
{"Q": "They first left Beijing and started from Shanghai. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Farmers want to grow legume crops. (B) They decided to travel China this summer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They decided to travel China this summer.\nExplanation: There is no indication in the sentence that farmers want to grow legume crops, so option (A) can be ruled out. However, the sentence clearly states that they \"started from Shanghai,\" implying that they had a specific destination in mind and were traveling somewhere. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was allowed three days of extra holiday and he returned his home. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was honored as a hero because of his brave deed. (B) Through the ancient Silk Road, China and the West exchanged tea, silk, porcelain, glass, gemstones, wool, etc.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was honored as a hero because of his brave deed.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that he was allowed three days of extra holiday, which suggests that he was given a special privilege or recognition. The most likely reason for this would be that he did something noteworthy or heroic, which earned him the honor. Option B is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide a plausible explanation."}}
{"Q": "He was the final winner of the game. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fisherman got a bluefin. (B) Tom has a strong ability to survival.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"he was the final winner of the game\", implying that the game was likely a fishing competition. Choice A states that the fisherman got a bluefin, which is a highly prized and valuable fish. It is plausible that catching a bluefin would give the fisherman a significant advantage and ultimately lead to him being the final winner of the game. Choice B, on the other hand, mentions Tom's ability to survival, which is not directly related to the game being played and therefore less likely to be the cause of the fisherman's victory."}}
{"Q": "Jason and I saw a mammal passing along. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He told me there is a good chance that this mammal is a artiodactyl. (B) He told me there is a good chance that this mammal is an artiodactyl.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: In this sentence, \"a good chance\" implies that there is a likelihood or probability that the mammal is an artiodactyl. Therefore, the correct word to use is \"an\" instead of \"a\" before \"artiodactyl\" because \"artiodactyl\" starts with a vowel sound."}}
{"Q": "The scientists injected nitrite into child blood. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The scientists found that the oxygen carrying capacity of the child's blood declined. (B) The feces could not be excreted out of the anus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The scientists found that the oxygen carrying capacity of the child's blood declined.\nExplanation: Nitrite can react with hemoglobin in the blood to form methemoglobin, which cannot carry oxygen. This means that the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood decreases, leading to hypoxia (lack of oxygen) in the body. This can be harmful and even life-threatening if not treated promptly. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not related to the injection of nitrite into the blood and is not a possible outcome of this experiment."}}
{"Q": "We saw something plunge-diving from the air. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) No one explained the phenomenon for us. (B) The teacher explained it was a booby getting its food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The teacher explained it was a booby getting its food. This answer is more plausible because it provides a logical explanation for the observed phenomenon. Boobies are known to plunge-dive from the air to catch fish, so it makes sense that this is what was seen. Option A, on the other hand, does not provide any explanation at all."}}
{"Q": "The star is burned and squeezed into ashes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A star crashes into a cloud of dust. (B) A star crashes into the sun where nucleosynthesis occurs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: When a star runs out of fuel, it can no longer produce the energy needed to counteract the force of gravity. This causes the star to collapse in on itself, resulting in a supernova explosion. During this explosion, nucleosynthesis occurs, which is the process of creating new elements through fusion reactions. The intense pressure and temperature cause the star's core to fuse heavier elements, eventually leading to the formation of iron. However, once the core is mostly composed of iron, fusion reactions can no longer occur, and the core collapses in on itself, causing a massive explosion that leaves behind a remnant of ashes."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's mother took use of astragalus to make food for her. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She usually eats Hamburgs. (B) Lucy becomes much healthier than before.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Lucy becomes much healthier than before.\nExplanation: Astragalus is a herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine for its immune-boosting properties. Consuming astragalus can help improve overall health and strengthen the immune system. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy became much healthier than before after consuming food made with astragalus. Choice A, on the other hand, is not related to the use of astragalus and does not provide a logical explanation for what happened as a result."}}
{"Q": "Mineral-rich herb is good to human body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought some chickweed to build his body. (B) People almost intake protein every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He bought some chickweed to build his body.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that mineral-rich herbs are good for the human body. Therefore, it is plausible that the person in question would buy some chickweed, which is known to be a mineral-rich herb, to improve their health and build their body. Option B, on the other hand, is not directly related to the statement and does not provide a logical explanation for what happened as a result of the mineral-rich herb being good for the human body."}}
{"Q": "The scientist applied some nitrogen fertilizer to the lawn. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The lawn has absorbed nitrogen fertilizer. (B) Suddenly it began to rain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The lawn has absorbed nitrogen fertilizer.\nExplanation: Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth, and applying nitrogen fertilizer to the lawn can promote healthy growth and green color. The fertilizer is absorbed by the roots of the grass and used to produce chlorophyll, which is necessary for photosynthesis. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lawn has absorbed the nitrogen fertilizer rather than suddenly raining, which is not directly related to the application of fertilizer."}}
{"Q": "Tom eats dairies every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is no longer constipated. (B) He kept health.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Eating dairies every day may help Tom maintain his health, as dairy products are a good source of calcium, protein, and other essential nutrients. However, it is not necessarily a guarantee that he will no longer be constipated. Other factors such as hydration, fiber intake, and physical activity also play a role in bowel regularity."}}
{"Q": "My major is anthropology. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Blood clots may bring me pain sometimes. (B) I study people in different culture settings everyday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that studying anthropology would result in learning about people in different cultural settings, rather than experiencing physical pain from blood clots. Anthropology is the study of human societies and cultures, and involves examining the beliefs, behaviors, and social structures of different groups of people. Therefore, it is likely that someone studying anthropology would focus on learning about different cultures and their practices."}}
{"Q": "He is getting smarter and smarter than before. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Frank eats nutritious food every day. (B) Rabbit is a kind of rodent.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Eating nutritious food can improve brain function and cognitive abilities, leading to increased intelligence. Therefore, it is more plausible that Frank's improved intelligence is due to his healthy diet rather than the unrelated fact that rabbits are rodents."}}
{"Q": "Mary found the extrusion of a mass through her vagina. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The diagnosis showed that this was prolapse. (B) It became a female.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The diagnosis showed that this was prolapse.\nExplanation: Prolapse is a medical condition where an organ or tissue in the body falls or slips out of its normal position. In this case, the extrusion of a mass through the vagina is a common symptom of pelvic organ prolapse. It occurs when the muscles and tissues supporting the pelvic organs weaken, causing them to drop down and push against the vaginal walls. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mary's condition is prolapse rather than the extruded mass becoming a female."}}
{"Q": "He enjoys the process of making still images appear alive through the action of motion. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The artist is good at serifs. (B) He likes making animations.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He likes making animations.\nExplanation: The statement clearly mentions that the artist enjoys the process of making still images appear alive through the action of motion. This indicates that the artist has an interest in animation and enjoys the process of bringing still images to life through motion. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer. Option (A) is irrelevant as it talks about serifs, which are decorative lines in typography and have no relation to animation."}}
{"Q": "She found that there was somehting in common with actinide. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary misused clozapine. (B) Lucy recenly did a reserach about berkelium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lucy recently did a research about berkelium.\nExplanation: Actinides are a group of elements that have similar chemical and physical properties. Berkelium is one of the actinide elements, so if Lucy did research on berkelium, she would have found similarities with other actinides. On the other hand, Mary misusing clozapine has no relation to actinides. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom loses his sheep once a week. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are several ocelots near Tom's farm. (B) Tom is a dragoon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The presence of ocelots near Tom's farm is a more plausible explanation for his sheep going missing once a week. Ocelots are known to prey on small animals like sheep, and their presence near the farm would increase the likelihood of Tom losing his sheep. On the other hand, being a dragoon has no direct correlation with losing sheep, making option B less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Trainers have changes of energy in their body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Metabolism indicates change of energy. (B) Hearing has three dimensions and the first two dimensions are known to normal people.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Metabolism is the process by which the body converts food into energy. Therefore, changes in metabolism can indicate changes in energy levels within the body. On the other hand, hearing and its dimensions have no direct correlation with changes in energy levels in the body."}}
{"Q": "Grace's father caught a babirusa. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Grace couldn't bite its meat at dinner. (B) He should take some colchicine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Grace couldn't bite its meat at dinner.\nExplanation: Babirusa is a type of wild pig found in Indonesia. It is considered a protected species, and hunting or killing it is illegal. Grace's father catching a babirusa would be a violation of the law, and if caught, he could face legal consequences. Therefore, it is more plausible that Grace couldn't eat the babirusa's meat at dinner because it would be illegal and unethical to consume meat from a protected species."}}
{"Q": "The waitress walked to him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom farted in class. (B) The guest asks for a new plate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The guest asks for a new plate.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the waitress walked to the customer because they asked for a new plate or made some other request, rather than because someone farted in class."}}
{"Q": "Lina went into her bedroom carelessly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was tripped by the chair. (B) Her baby is no healthy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was tripped by the chair.\nExplanation: If Lina went into her bedroom carelessly, it is more likely that she would trip over something in her path, such as a chair, rather than her baby suddenly becoming unhealthy. Tripping over a chair is a common accident that can happen when someone is not paying attention to their surroundings."}}
{"Q": "I knew he told a lie. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary is a film producer. (B) He said he saw leprechauns yesterday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of him telling a lie is that he claimed to have seen leprechauns, which is an unlikely and fantastical event. Mary being a film producer has no relevance to the situation and is not a plausible cause for him telling a lie."}}
{"Q": "More tubes are needed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John prepares to make paper. (B) Fresh air should be delivered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John prepares to make paper.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that more tubes are needed, which implies that there is a need for a specific process that requires the use of tubes. Option A states that John is preparing to make paper, which is a process that involves the use of tubes in paper mills. Therefore, it is more plausible that the need for more tubes is due to John's preparation for making paper. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that fresh air should be delivered, which is not related to the need for more tubes."}}
{"Q": "The queen begins to increase her egg laying rate at that time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It's time for thrushes to propagate. (B) Having pollen stored up is something the bees are keeping for mid-late winter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Having pollen stored up is something the bees are keeping for mid-late winter.\n\nExplanation: The queen bee's egg laying rate is closely tied to the availability of food and resources in the hive. As winter approaches, bees work hard to collect and store pollen to ensure they have enough food to survive the colder months. When the hive has a sufficient amount of stored pollen, the queen bee will begin to increase her egg laying rate in preparation for the upcoming winter. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the bees' behavior and their need to store pollen for the winter. Option A, on the other hand, is unrelated to the queen bee's egg laying rate and does not provide a logical explanation for the behavior."}}
{"Q": "It cannot communicate with other bees about the food sources. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The character Feeder is useless in the game. (B) This bee hurts and cannot dance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This bee hurts and cannot dance.\nExplanation: In real life, bees communicate with each other about food sources through a dance called the waggle dance. However, if a bee is injured and cannot perform the dance, it will not be able to communicate with other bees about the food sources. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) is not relevant to the question and does not explain why the bee cannot communicate about food sources."}}
{"Q": "John has a pest infestation in his garden. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought some medicine to get rid of squash bugs. (B) He put traps in the bushes at night, and caught some jackrabbits the next morning.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John would buy medicine to get rid of squash bugs, as they are a common pest in gardens and there are many products available specifically for this purpose. Putting traps in the bushes at night to catch jackrabbits would not be an effective solution for a pest infestation in a garden, as jackrabbits are not typically considered a garden pest and there are likely more effective methods for dealing with them if they were causing damage."}}
{"Q": "All aspects of society should be responsible for his death. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He died last month. (B) Litter killed the cleaner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Litter killed the cleaner.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the cleaner died due to the negligence of society in properly disposing of their litter. Litter can pose a serious threat to the health and safety of individuals, and it is the responsibility of everyone in society to ensure that they dispose of their waste properly. If the cleaner died as a result of coming into contact with hazardous litter, then it is the responsibility of society as a whole to take steps to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future."}}
{"Q": "Jack is an oceanographer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is used to the seasonal variability. (B) He is at sea all the year round.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He is used to the seasonal variability.\nExplanation: As an oceanographer, Jack studies the ocean and its various phenomena, including seasonal changes. Therefore, it is more plausible that he is used to the seasonal variability rather than being at sea all year round. While he may spend some time at sea conducting research, it is unlikely that he would be at sea constantly throughout the year."}}
{"Q": "Tim learnt more knowledge with the growth of age. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His pursuits became easier for him. (B) He becomes more excellent than before.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He becomes more excellent than before.\nExplanation: As Tim gained more knowledge with age, he would have become more skilled and knowledgeable in his pursuits. This would have made him more excellent than before, as he would have had a better understanding of the subject matter and would have been able to apply his knowledge more effectively. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not necessarily true, as even with more knowledge, pursuits can still be challenging and require effort and dedication."}}
{"Q": "He would have to travel a long distances. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man wished to reach Mercury in the atmosphere. (B) The cerebral cortex of his brain was damaged.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The cerebral cortex of his brain was damaged.\nExplanation: If the man's cerebral cortex was damaged, it could affect his ability to navigate and understand his surroundings. This could lead to him traveling long distances unintentionally or getting lost and having to travel a long way to find his way back. Option A is not plausible as it is currently impossible for humans to reach Mercury in the atmosphere."}}
{"Q": "All students have watsed some rice and thrown them. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are more people starving. (B) They are just like scavengers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There are more people starving.\nExplanation: When students waste rice and throw it away, it contributes to food waste. This food waste can accumulate and lead to a shortage of food resources, which can result in more people going hungry or starving. Additionally, wasting food also has negative environmental impacts, such as contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and wasting resources like water and energy used to produce the food. Therefore, it is important to reduce food waste and use resources more efficiently to help address issues of hunger and sustainability."}}
{"Q": "The hunter wants to hunt the deer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He thought it was too noisy. (B) He was always following the deer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was always following the deer.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if the hunter wants to hunt the deer, he would naturally follow it in order to get close enough to take a shot. Option A, on the other hand, doesn't make sense as being noisy would not necessarily prevent the hunter from hunting the deer."}}
{"Q": "I crave for food. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was starved for days. (B) The trout scrounged for food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the person was starved for days. Hunger is a natural response to not having enough food for an extended period of time. The second option, about the trout, is unrelated and does not provide a logical explanation for the person's craving for food."}}
{"Q": "A long shower made my skin lost moisture. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I ran to buy unguent to treat white patches. (B) I saw the Shrinkage on my body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Taking a long shower can strip the skin of its natural oils and moisture, leading to dryness and potentially causing white patches. Using an unguent or moisturizer can help replenish the lost moisture and prevent further damage to the skin. Shrinkage on the body is not a common result of losing moisture from a long shower."}}
{"Q": "The living environment here is harsh. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The residents here are in good health. (B) The health of residents is affected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The health of residents is affected.\nExplanation: The harsh living environment can have negative effects on the health of residents. For example, extreme temperatures, poor air quality, and lack of access to clean water can lead to respiratory problems, dehydration, and other health issues. Therefore, it is more plausible that the health of residents is affected rather than them being in good health."}}
{"Q": "They poured a lot of waste water into the river. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The amount of pollutants they emit exceeds the limit. (B) James was eventually poisoned.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The amount of pollutants they emit exceeds the limit.\nExplanation: When a lot of waste water is poured into a river, it can lead to an increase in the amount of pollutants in the water. This can cause harm to the aquatic life and also affect the quality of the water. If the amount of pollutants exceeds the limit set by the government, it can lead to legal consequences for the company or individuals responsible for the waste water discharge. On the other hand, there is no evidence to suggest that James was poisoned as a result of the waste water discharge."}}
{"Q": "Water was used as as a new source of electricity. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom filled the bath tub with hot water. (B) This hydro-energetic power manifested its own drawbacks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: When water is used as a new source of electricity, it is likely that hydro-energetic power is being referred to. While this form of energy production is renewable and environmentally friendly, it can also have drawbacks such as the displacement of wildlife and alteration of natural water flow. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it acknowledges the potential negative consequences of using water as a source of electricity. Option A is unrelated and does not provide a logical consequence of using water for electricity."}}
{"Q": "They are afraid of being hurt, so they walked and ate the food in Tom's hands. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are some colugos. (B) Tom has seen a lot of rhes and he bought some food for them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of their fear and subsequent behavior is more likely to be related to Tom and the food he is holding, rather than the presence of colugos. Option B suggests that Tom has seen a lot of rhes (presumably referring to a type of animal) and bought food for them, which could explain why the individuals in question are afraid of being hurt but still approach Tom for food."}}
{"Q": "The teacher said that kilograms should be used. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The students don't know what to represent the weight of a bull. (B) The teacher asked the student gave detail descriptions on this word.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The students don't know what to represent the weight of a bull.\n\nExplanation: The teacher's statement that kilograms should be used suggests that the students were using a different unit of measurement to represent the weight of a bull. As kilograms are a commonly used unit of measurement for weight, it is likely that the teacher recommended this unit to ensure that the students were using a standard and widely recognized unit of measurement. The fact that the teacher did not ask the students to provide detail descriptions on the word suggests that the issue was not with the students' understanding of the term \"bull,\" but rather with their choice of unit of measurement."}}
{"Q": "Tom suffers from diabete. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He chooses barley as his staple food. (B) Tom can only eat food with sweeteners when he wants to eat sugar.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom can only eat food with sweeteners when he wants to eat sugar.\nExplanation: Since Tom suffers from diabetes, his body cannot regulate blood sugar levels properly. Consuming foods high in sugar can cause a spike in blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous for him. Therefore, he may need to limit his intake of sugary foods and instead opt for foods with artificial sweeteners or natural sweeteners like stevia. Choosing barley as his staple food may be a healthy choice, but it is not necessarily a direct result of his diabetes."}}
{"Q": "Cedar shrinks in the smallest sense. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Robins cocked their heads. (B) When it comes to winter, trees begin to shrink.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) When it comes to winter, trees begin to shrink.\nExplanation: Cedar, like many other trees, experiences a natural process of shrinking during the winter months. This is due to the fact that the tree's growth slows down or stops altogether during this time, causing the cells to contract and the wood to become denser. This process is known as winter dormancy and is a survival mechanism that helps the tree conserve energy and protect itself from the harsh winter conditions. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer than option (A), which has no logical connection to the shrinking of cedar."}}
{"Q": "He used vinegar. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wanted to remove hard water deposits from glassware. (B) Tom wants to made some cider.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Vinegar is commonly used as a natural cleaning agent and is effective in removing hard water deposits from glassware. It is unlikely that someone would use vinegar to make cider, as cider is typically made from apples or other fruit. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Our teacher informed us that it was chemiluminescence. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We were curious about the light produced after a chemical reaction. (B) We wanted to know the smallest known agents of infectious disease.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Chemiluminescence is the emission of light as a result of a chemical reaction. Therefore, the cause of the light produced was likely due to a chemical reaction that occurred, which the students were curious about. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the phenomenon of chemiluminescence and is not a plausible explanation for the situation described."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought some bricks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He built his own Cuckoo house. (B) He built a wall.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He built a wall.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tom bought bricks to build a wall, as this is a common use for bricks in construction. Building a Cuckoo house is not a common use for bricks and is less likely to be the result of Tom's purchase."}}
{"Q": "Tom has put a bismuth into the beaker. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found that the bismuth was oxidized after several hours. (B) There are more carbon dioxide in the air.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Bismuth is a chemical element that is not very reactive and does not readily react with air or water. Therefore, it is unlikely that the presence of bismuth in the beaker would cause an increase in carbon dioxide in the air. On the other hand, bismuth can react with certain chemicals in the beaker, such as acids, to form bismuth salts. Over time, this reaction can lead to the oxidation of the bismuth, resulting in the formation of bismuth oxide. Therefore, it is more plausible that the bismuth in the beaker would be oxidized after several hours."}}
{"Q": "ADIS's brain is always congested. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Crittes loiter around people's houses. (B) ADIS's doctor says ADIS's brain always unabated thinking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. ADIS's doctor says ADIS's brain always unabated thinking.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests a medical reason for ADIS's congested brain. If ADIS's brain is always thinking and unable to rest, it could lead to mental exhaustion and congestion. On the other hand, choice A about crittes loitering around people's houses seems unrelated and unlikely to cause brain congestion."}}
{"Q": "The number of lumber farms around the city has increased. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The city has a large output of newspapers. (B) The small city focuses on economic development.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The small city focuses on economic development.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the increase in lumber farms is due to the city's focus on economic development rather than the output of newspapers. Lumber is a valuable resource and can be used in various industries, making it a profitable business. Therefore, it is likely that the city encouraged the establishment of lumber farms to boost its economy."}}
{"Q": "They were unable to make appropriate decisions. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They asked their team of experts for suggestions. (B) I found a linear molecule of acetylene with all four atoms in a straight line.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They asked their team of experts for suggestions.\nExplanation: When individuals are unable to make appropriate decisions, seeking advice and suggestions from a team of experts can be a helpful solution. This allows for a diverse range of perspectives and expertise to be considered, leading to a more informed decision-making process. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the situation described in the question."}}
{"Q": "/p/ can be realized in many ways in actual articulations. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) /p/ cannot represent them all. (B) These speech sounds were represented by the phenem /p/.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: /p/ is a phoneme, which represents a set of speech sounds that are perceived as the same by speakers of a language. However, in actual articulations, /p/ can be realized in different ways depending on the context, the speaker, and other factors. For example, in English, /p/ can be aspirated (with a puff of air), unaspirated (without a puff of air), or unreleased (with no audible release of air). These different realizations of /p/ are not considered separate phonemes because they do not change the meaning of a word. However, they are different allophones of /p/, which means that they are different variants of the same phoneme. Therefore, choice A is the more plausible answer because /p/ cannot represent all the different realizations of the sound in actual articulations."}}
{"Q": "Tom drink a glass of lemonade. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His dream has come true. (B) Tom was full.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom was full.\nExplanation: Drinking a glass of lemonade would likely make Tom feel full, as liquids can help fill the stomach and reduce hunger. Option A, \"His dream has come true,\" is not a plausible answer as drinking lemonade is unlikely to be a dream come true for most people."}}
{"Q": "He went on to study radiology. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John was interested in the study of human images. (B) He chooses to study biochemistry in university.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John was interested in the study of human images.\nExplanation: The sentence states that John \"went on\" to study radiology, which implies that he had some prior interest or experience in the field. The fact that he chose to study radiology specifically suggests that he had a fascination with human images, such as X-rays or MRIs, and wanted to learn more about how they are produced and interpreted. Choice B, which suggests that John studied biochemistry and then switched to radiology, is less plausible because it does not explain why he would make such a drastic change in his academic focus."}}
{"Q": "The old woman wants to have food every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She tries her best to play. (B) She tries her best to go to prison.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She tries her best to play.\nExplanation: The statement about the old woman wanting food every day does not suggest any negative consequences or actions that would lead her to try her best to go to prison. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the old woman is trying her best to play or participate in activities that would help her earn or obtain food every day."}}
{"Q": "The illiterary woman has no idea about election. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are several new bulges on his back today. (B) She wouldn't know the idea of the chosen people.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She wouldn't know the idea of the chosen people.\nExplanation: The fact that the illiterate woman has no idea about elections suggests that she lacks knowledge about the political process and how it works. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would understand the concept of \"chosen people,\" which is a religious or cultural idea. Option A is unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "He suffers from leptospirosis now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man once contacted with contaminated rat urine. (B) Tom had found his weakness but did not correct it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The man once contacted with contaminated rat urine.\nExplanation: Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that is commonly spread through contact with the urine of infected animals, particularly rats. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man contracted leptospirosis from coming into contact with contaminated rat urine rather than Tom finding his weakness and not correcting it."}}
{"Q": "The boy adopted many results to refute her. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary kept several swallows. (B) The boy was opposed to her idea.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the boy was trying to refute Mary's idea, indicating that he was opposed to it. The fact that Mary kept several swallows is not relevant to the cause of the boy's actions. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The scientists found lots of leucocytes accumulated in this cut swallowing bacteria. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The factory has bought a lot of pulp. (B) The cut was inflamed because of the invading bacteria.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The cut was inflamed because of the invading bacteria.\nExplanation: When bacteria invade a cut, the body's immune system responds by sending white blood cells (leucocytes) to the site of infection to fight off the bacteria. This immune response causes inflammation, which can be seen as redness, swelling, and warmth around the cut. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) about the factory buying pulp is unrelated and does not explain the presence of leucocytes in the cut."}}
{"Q": "Then people use the satiety of bananas to lose weight. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Resistant starch is difficult to digest. (B) Flavonoids are good for our health.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Bananas contain resistant starch, which is a type of carbohydrate that is not easily digested by the body. This means that it takes longer for the body to break down and absorb the starch, leading to a slower release of glucose into the bloodstream and a longer feeling of fullness. This can help people feel satisfied and eat less, leading to weight loss. Flavonoids, while beneficial for health, do not directly contribute to satiety and weight loss in the same way that resistant starch does."}}
{"Q": "Mary likes to eat vegetables without appearance. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary doesn't likes to eat parsley. (B) Mary doeesn't likes to eat carrot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer.\n\nExplanation: The statement \"Mary likes to eat vegetables without appearance\" means that Mary likes to eat vegetables without caring about their appearance. It does not specify which vegetables she likes or dislikes. Therefore, neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer as they both suggest that Mary dislikes a specific vegetable, which is not supported by the given statement."}}
{"Q": "She decides to study economy in college. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy is a person with much vanity. (B) Mary wants to make the best of her life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Mary wants to make the best of her life.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because studying economy can lead to a successful career and financial stability, which aligns with Mary's goal of making the best of her life. On the other hand, choice A, which suggests that Lucy is a person with much vanity, does not provide a logical reason for why she would choose to study economy."}}
{"Q": "The helicopter came to another hemisphere of Earth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The pilot saw streams on the moon. (B) The pilot saw jet streams.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The pilot saw jet streams.\nExplanation: When a helicopter travels to another hemisphere of Earth, it is likely to encounter different weather patterns and atmospheric conditions. Jet streams are fast-moving air currents that flow high in the atmosphere and can be seen from the air. Therefore, it is more plausible that the pilot saw jet streams rather than streams on the moon, which is not possible as there is no water on the moon."}}
{"Q": "They sleep together. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy has many sexual relationships with different men. (B) These two are heterosexuals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) These two are heterosexuals.\nExplanation: The fact that they sleep together does not necessarily imply that Lucy has many sexual relationships with different men. It is more plausible that they are simply two heterosexual individuals who have chosen to engage in sexual activity together."}}
{"Q": "The police fired a shot. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The birds on the tree were scared away. (B) They took us in.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The birds on the tree were scared away.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the sound of a gunshot would scare away birds than result in the immediate arrest of the speaker. Option B seems unlikely without further context or information."}}
{"Q": "His mother took use of fumigation and made sure that seafood are clean. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to eat some seafood. (B) There is a lot of dust where Tom works.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The use of fumigation and ensuring cleanliness of seafood suggests that the cause is related to hygiene and sanitation. Option B, which mentions a lot of dust where Tom works, could lead to contamination of seafood and hence the need for fumigation and cleaning. Option A, which suggests Tom's desire to eat seafood, does not provide a logical reason for the mother's actions."}}
{"Q": "Tom loves smiling. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He always felt the happiness inside the consciousness. (B) Tom often feels happy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom often feels happy.\nExplanation: Smiling is often associated with positive emotions such as happiness and joy. Therefore, it is likely that Tom's love for smiling results in him feeling happy more often than not. While it is possible that he also feels the happiness inside his consciousness, this is a more abstract and subjective concept that cannot be definitively determined."}}
{"Q": "All of generations accepted and took use of them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) During her time in office, Margaret Thatcher introduced a series of tough reforms. (B) The philosophers have proposed a lot of true perceptions which are beneficial to poeple's life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The philosophers have proposed a lot of true perceptions which are beneficial to people's life.\nExplanation: Throughout history, philosophers have offered insights and ideas that have been accepted and utilized by subsequent generations. These ideas have often been beneficial to people's lives, leading to their widespread adoption. While Margaret Thatcher's reforms may have been influential in their own right, they are not necessarily the cause of generations accepting and using certain ideas or practices."}}
{"Q": "The diver visited many ocean basins. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found beautiful seamounts. (B) He saw a lot f yellowfins and dolphins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He found beautiful seamounts.\nExplanation: Since the diver visited many ocean basins, it is more likely that he would come across different geological features such as seamounts, which are underwater mountains. On the other hand, seeing a lot of yellowfins and dolphins would depend on the specific location and time of the diver's visits, making it less plausible as a general result of visiting many ocean basins."}}
{"Q": "We plan to see ringtails. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The guide suggested us going to mangrove areas. (B) We will go to the habitats.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The guide suggested us going to mangrove areas.\nExplanation: Since the goal is to see ringtails, it is likely that the guide would suggest going to areas where they are known to inhabit. Mangrove areas are known to be a habitat for ringtails, so it is a plausible suggestion from the guide. Option B is also a possibility, but it is less specific and does not provide any information on where to find the ringtails."}}
{"Q": "He won MVP in the game. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The palyer wants to rank top in the game. (B) He is a soccer player and good at heading the ball.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The fact that he won MVP in the game suggests that he performed exceptionally well and stood out among the other players. The information provided about him being a soccer player and good at heading the ball is more relevant to his performance in the game and is a more plausible explanation for why he won MVP. Choice (A) is not necessarily relevant to his performance in the game and is therefore less likely to be the cause of him winning MVP."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have discovered the permanent magnetic moment of atoms. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists study the paramagnetism of atoms. (B) The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Scientists study the paramagnetism of atoms.\nExplanation: Paramagnetism is the property of certain materials to become weakly magnetized in the presence of an external magnetic field. By studying the paramagnetism of atoms, scientists were able to determine the permanent magnetic moment of atoms. This is because the magnetic moment of an atom is related to its paramagnetic behavior. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the discovery of the permanent magnetic moment of atoms."}}
{"Q": "There was an accident. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A journalist was explaining it to the audience. (B) He has a tendency to be affected by mental disease.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: It depends on the context of the accident and the information provided. Without more information, it is impossible to determine a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The pressure in the tank has increased. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The plane was flying above the Atlantic. (B) The temperature has risen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The temperature has risen.\nExplanation: An increase in temperature causes the molecules in the gas to move faster and collide more frequently with the walls of the tank, resulting in an increase in pressure. Flying above the Atlantic would not necessarily cause an increase in pressure unless there was a change in altitude or temperature. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I have seen fleas's three stages in their lifecycle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They complete their life cycle over two years. (B) Fleas have at least three stages.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Fleas have at least three stages.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the person has seen fleas in all three stages of their lifecycle, which indicates that fleas have at least three stages. The statement does not provide any information about the duration of their life cycle, so option A cannot be considered a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The flower was beautiful and fragrant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Soon it achieved significant growth. (B) Lucy went to smell it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Lucy went to smell it.\nExplanation: The sentence only mentions the beauty and fragrance of the flower, and does not provide any information about its growth or any other outcome. However, the mention of its fragrance suggests that someone might have been attracted to it, and the most likely scenario is that Lucy went to smell it."}}
{"Q": "The farmers planted many crops. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Grain can be used to make food. (B) The country developed much better in economy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: When farmers plant crops, they are usually grown for a specific purpose, such as producing food or other products. In this case, the crops could be used to make food, which would be a direct result of the farmers' efforts. While it is possible that the country's economy could improve as a result of increased crop production, this would be a more indirect effect and not necessarily a guaranteed outcome. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I've been feeling under stress lately. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Various health problems prevail these days. (B) Doctors often prescribe this medicine to patients.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Various health problems prevail these days.\nExplanation: Stress can have a negative impact on our physical and mental health. It can lead to various health problems such as headaches, fatigue, digestive issues, high blood pressure, and even depression or anxiety. Therefore, it is plausible that feeling under stress lately could result in various health problems prevailing."}}
{"Q": "This two kids will go to skiing this afternoon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have no choice. (B) Their parents asked them to wear protective clothing in case of accidents.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Their parents asked them to wear protective clothing in case of accidents.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the parents would take precautions to ensure their children's safety while skiing, such as asking them to wear protective clothing. The fact that the children are going skiing implies that they have a choice to do so, so option (A) is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He should take on more responsibilities. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom became a father. (B) Tom is a vicar.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Becoming a father is a common reason for individuals to take on more responsibilities as they have a new dependent to care for and provide for. Being a vicar may also involve responsibilities, but it is not necessarily a direct cause for Tom to take on more responsibilities in his personal life."}}
{"Q": "Lisa is an architect. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa designs buildings. (B) She eats croutons everyday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lisa designs buildings.\nExplanation: As an architect, Lisa's profession involves designing buildings. Therefore, it is a plausible answer that designing buildings is the result of her being an architect. Eating croutons everyday is not related to her profession as an architect and is an unlikely result."}}
{"Q": "The petechiae might turn into eccchymoses. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The petechiae on his arm became pimples. (B) The petechiae on his arm became much bigger.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The petechiae on his arm became much bigger.\nExplanation: Petechiae are small, pinpoint-sized red or purple spots on the skin caused by bleeding under the skin. If the bleeding continues, the petechiae may merge and form larger areas of bleeding called ecchymoses or bruises. Therefore, it is more plausible that the petechiae on the arm became much bigger and turned into ecchymoses rather than becoming pimples."}}
{"Q": "Mosquitos are ubiquitous around here. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We can raise some bullfrogs. (B) There is a lot of mud.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We can raise some bullfrogs.\nExplanation: Bullfrogs are natural predators of mosquitoes and can help control their population. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which does not have a direct correlation with the presence of mosquitoes."}}
{"Q": "Fishermen harvest many fish with broad flat bills and many of them are hurt by the tooth-like notches. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is the time of trumpeters recently. (B) The most impressed was the beautiful but different heads they have.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: None of the choices are plausible answers to the question.\n\nExplanation: The question does not provide enough information to determine a plausible answer. It is unclear what the question is asking for or what the context is."}}
{"Q": "Faeries like living in it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The nature is the gift for the whole world. (B) There is a tree in the garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: There is a tree in the garden.\nExplanation: The presence of a tree in the garden could provide shelter, food, and a source of magic for the faeries. Trees are often seen as sacred in many cultures and are believed to have mystical properties. Therefore, it is more plausible that the faeries are attracted to the tree rather than the vague statement that nature is a gift for the whole world."}}
{"Q": "He attacked her without proof. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is quite a lunatic. (B) Midwifes came to her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: It is not possible to determine the result based on the given information.\nExplanation: The sentence only states that he attacked her without proof, but it does not provide any information about what happened as a result. Therefore, it is not possible to choose a plausible answer from the given choices."}}
{"Q": "The boletes decayed this afternoon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary bought some boletes from the market this morning. (B) Biologists sealed the food for preservation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mary bought some boletes from the market this morning.\nExplanation: Boletes are a type of mushroom that can spoil quickly if not stored properly. If Mary bought the boletes from the market in the morning, it is possible that they were not fresh or were not stored properly before she purchased them. This could have led to their decay in the afternoon. Option B, biologists sealing the food for preservation, is not a plausible answer as it suggests that the food was being preserved and should not have decayed so quickly."}}
{"Q": "He holds securities in a fractional ownership stake in this company now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought some stock. (B) He likes the women in this company.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He bought some stock.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for someone to hold securities in a company is that they have purchased stock in that company. It is unlikely that someone would hold a fractional ownership stake in a company simply because they like the women who work there. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation."}}
{"Q": "Jack is a monotheist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His car crasshed into the tree. (B) He believes there is just one god in the world.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: As a monotheist, Jack believes in the existence of only one god. This belief does not have any direct correlation with his car crashing into a tree. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He is suffering from arteriosclerosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor found that the cells on Tom's arm began to move inwards. (B) Calcium deposits in Tom's arteries.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Calcium deposits in Tom's arteries.\nExplanation: Arteriosclerosis is a condition where the arteries become hardened and narrowed due to the buildup of plaque, which is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances. Calcium deposits in the arteries can cause them to become stiff and less flexible, leading to arteriosclerosis. The movement of cells on Tom's arm (choice A) is not a known cause of arteriosclerosis."}}
{"Q": "The forest covers a vast area. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mangabeys took over the forest. (B) This forest is rich in resources.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that the forest is rich in resources. This could include fertile soil, water sources, and a variety of plant and animal life that can sustain a large ecosystem. Mangabeys, which are a type of monkey, may be present in the forest, but they would not be the cause of the forest's vast coverage."}}
{"Q": "Jack lives in the tropics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack's residence produces a lot of sugarcane. (B) He would not be infected with any virus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He would not be infected with any virus.\nExplanation: Living in the tropics does not necessarily mean that Jack's residence produces a lot of sugarcane. However, it is true that living in the tropics can provide some immunity to certain viruses due to the warm and humid climate, which is not conducive to the survival of some viruses. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "People used umbrella to resist sleet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People to carry mainframe computers with smaller size to work. (B) Snowflakes fell down in the humid weather.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Sleet is a type of precipitation that occurs when snowflakes partially melt as they fall through a layer of warm air and then refreeze as they pass through a layer of cold air near the ground. This results in small, icy pellets that can be painful to the skin. Umbrellas can be used to protect oneself from sleet, as well as rain. Choice (A) is not related to the use of umbrellas to resist sleet."}}
{"Q": "The hippo won. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Most animals need to mate. (B) The hippo and the breeder in the zoo are chasing a ball.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The cause of the hippo winning is likely due to the fact that it was chasing a ball with the breeder in the zoo. Option (A) about animals needing to mate is not relevant to the given scenario and does not provide a plausible explanation for the hippo winning."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to a drama show last night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He won the first prize in the competition. (B) Tom went home after the stops.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom went home after the show.\nExplanation: The question only states that Tom went to a drama show, but it does not provide any information about him participating in a competition or winning a prize. Therefore, option A is unlikely. Option B, on the other hand, is a more plausible answer as it is common for people to go home after attending a show."}}
{"Q": "There is still vegetation near the stream during the dry periods. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The gardener takes them into consideration. (B) The stream keeps flowing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The stream keeps flowing.\n\nExplanation: The presence of vegetation near the stream during dry periods indicates that the plants are able to access water from the stream, which means that the stream is still flowing. This is because the plants need water to survive and would not be able to grow if the stream had completely dried up. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer as it directly relates to the presence of vegetation near the stream. Option A, on the other hand, is not necessarily related to the presence of vegetation and is not a direct result of the stream still flowing."}}
{"Q": "My companion were tired. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They returned home. (B) His wife gave assistanc to him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They returned home.\nExplanation: If the companions were tired, it is likely that they would want to rest and recuperate. Therefore, the most plausible answer would be that they returned home to rest. Option B, where his wife gave assistance, is not a likely outcome as there is no mention of a wife in the question."}}
{"Q": "Light can be relax. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists show this is Alpha. (B) He can't eat too much.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Scientists show this is Alpha.\nExplanation: This question seems to be incomplete or unclear, but assuming that \"Light can be relax\" means that light can be relaxed or slowed down, it is plausible that scientists have shown this to be true and have labeled it as Alpha. However, there is no logical connection between light being relaxed and someone not being able to eat too much, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The farmer's wheat got enough nutritions. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got some viable seeds. (B) The production was of good quality.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The production was of good quality.\nExplanation: When a crop receives enough nutrients, it grows well and produces a good yield. In the case of wheat, the grains will be plump and healthy, resulting in a high-quality harvest. While viable seeds are important for future planting, the immediate result of well-nourished crops is a good harvest. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack put the quilt in the sun to dry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The quilt is warm. (B) The quilt is dirty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The quilt is warm.\nExplanation: When Jack put the quilt in the sun to dry, the heat from the sun would have caused the quilt to become warm. This is a natural result of exposing wet fabric to sunlight. Option B, that the quilt is dirty, is not a plausible answer as the sun would not make the quilt dirtier."}}
{"Q": "The witch was not allowed to enter indigenous women's sites. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She often deals with their delirium. (B) She had no place to practise rituals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She had no place to practise rituals.\nExplanation: As the witch was not allowed to enter indigenous women's sites, she would not have access to the spaces where they conducted their rituals. This would mean that she would have no place to practise her own rituals, which could be a significant hindrance to her spiritual and magical practices. Option A, dealing with their delirium, does not seem to be a likely consequence of not being allowed to enter indigenous women's sites."}}
{"Q": "Lucy took good care of her baby carefully. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her baby was healthy when she grew up. (B) He was gradually woken up to life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her baby was healthy when she grew up.\nExplanation: Taking good care of a baby is essential for their healthy growth and development. By taking care of her baby carefully, Lucy ensured that her baby received proper nutrition, hygiene, and medical attention, which would have contributed to her baby's good health as she grew up. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, does not make sense in the given context."}}
{"Q": "The angel controls the Kingdom of Heaven. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dominion is part of his responsibility. (B) She has the duty to conduct ceremonies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Dominion is part of his responsibility.\nExplanation: In many religious beliefs, angels are believed to have dominion over certain aspects of the world or afterlife. In this case, the angel is said to control the Kingdom of Heaven, which would imply that they have dominion over it and are responsible for its management. Conducting ceremonies, on the other hand, is not necessarily a responsibility associated with angels in general or with the control of the Kingdom of Heaven specifically."}}
{"Q": "The doctor found that the number of red pigment hemoglobins was too high. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom drew some blood to check his body. (B) The patient showed symptoms of natriuresis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The patient showed symptoms of natriuresis.\nExplanation: Natriuresis is the excretion of an excessive amount of sodium in the urine. This can lead to dehydration and an increase in the concentration of red blood cells, including hemoglobin. Therefore, the high number of red pigment hemoglobins could be a result of the patient's natriuresis symptoms. Drawing blood to check the body (option A) would not directly cause an increase in hemoglobin levels."}}
{"Q": "Why do songbirds migrate at night? What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is safer for them. (B) It is harder for them to resist the cold in winter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It is safer for them.\nExplanation: Songbirds migrate at night because it is safer for them. During the day, they are more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and eagles. By migrating at night, they can avoid these predators and also take advantage of cooler temperatures and calmer winds. Additionally, the stars and moon provide navigation cues for the birds, making it easier for them to find their way."}}
{"Q": "The government decided to pump sea water and replace hem in the canal. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists study the effect of inductions on oxygen uptake by plants. (B) The canal was lack of water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The canal was lack of water.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the canal was lacking water, which prompted the government to pump sea water and replace it. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as drought, low rainfall, or increased demand for water usage. Scientists studying the effect of inductions on oxygen uptake by plants would not necessarily lead to the decision to pump sea water into the canal."}}
{"Q": "He took in more zinc. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wants to have more muscles. (B) Jerry wants his urinary system to be healthy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jerry wants his urinary system to be healthy.\nExplanation: Zinc is known to have a positive effect on the urinary system, particularly in preventing urinary tract infections and promoting overall urinary health. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jerry took in more zinc for this reason rather than for building muscles, which is not directly related to zinc intake."}}
{"Q": "He will not be messed up with love. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The master has no lust. (B) Tom has a good conscience.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The master has no lust.\nExplanation: The statement implies that the person referred to will not be emotionally affected by love. The most plausible reason for this is that the person does not have any sexual desire or lust, which could cloud their judgment and emotions. Therefore, option (A) is the more likely answer. Option (B) is not relevant to the statement and does not provide a logical explanation for why the person will not be messed up with love."}}
{"Q": "White recommended that the experimenters study the chromosome traits of voles. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The lab wants to study elephants. (B) The laboratory was asked to study special chromosome traits.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The text states that White recommended studying the chromosome traits of voles because they have \"special chromosome traits that make them ideal for studying the genetic basis of behavior.\" This suggests that the laboratory was asked to study these traits specifically, rather than choosing to study elephants or some other animal."}}
{"Q": "The vegetations in our garden was out of control. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many germinating seedlings were killed. (B) We bought herbicides to deal with this problem.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If the vegetation in the garden was out of control, it is more likely that the solution would be to buy herbicides to deal with the problem rather than killing germinating seedlings. Herbicides are designed to kill unwanted plants and are commonly used to control vegetation in gardens and farms. Killing germinating seedlings would not necessarily solve the problem of overgrown vegetation."}}
{"Q": "Tom has bought a brightness can. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can see the path clearly at night. (B) The brightness can can be bought in the shop.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He can see the path clearly at night.\nExplanation: Since Tom has bought a brightness can, it is likely that he can use it to illuminate his surroundings and see the path clearly at night. Option B is not a plausible answer as it only states that the brightness can can be bought in a shop, which does not provide any information about what happened as a result of Tom buying it."}}
{"Q": "Mary poured leonardite into a glass of alkali. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The remaining fraction of leonadite is humin. (B) The aquatic plants in the sea are thriving.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The remaining fraction of leonardite is humin.\nExplanation: Leonardite is a type of coal-like substance that is rich in humic acid. When it is mixed with an alkali, it reacts to form humate salts and humic acid. The humic acid then breaks down into humin, which is a stable, insoluble form of organic matter. Therefore, the most plausible outcome of Mary pouring leonardite into an alkali is that the remaining fraction of leonardite is humin. Option B, stating that aquatic plants in the sea are thriving, is not a logical consequence of mixing leonardite with an alkali."}}
{"Q": "John became the new leader of the apostolic church. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His goal of evangelism became firmer. (B) He will be a leading figure for future.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His goal of evangelism became firmer.\nExplanation: As the new leader of the apostolic church, John would have felt a greater responsibility to spread the message of the church and bring more people into the faith. This would have likely led to a renewed focus on evangelism and a stronger commitment to sharing the teachings of the church with others. While John may also become a leading figure for the future, this is not necessarily a direct result of his appointment as leader of the apostolic church."}}
{"Q": "I am responsible for the health management of my child. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I need to plan for his vaccinations. (B) She is an expert in treating children from birth to teens.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Taking responsibility for the health management of a child involves planning for their vaccinations, ensuring they receive regular check-ups, and monitoring their overall health and well-being. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the responsibility of managing a child's health. Option B, on the other hand, seems unrelated and does not address the issue of health management."}}
{"Q": "Scientists found that ptarmigans have different colors in different seasons. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They observe white ptarmigans in winter, but brown ptarmigans in summer. (B) He found that they came in two types.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They observe white ptarmigans in winter, but brown ptarmigans in summer.\n\nExplanation: Scientists observed that ptarmigans change their feather color according to the season. In winter, they have white feathers to blend in with the snow, while in summer, they have brown feathers to blend in with the ground. Therefore, it is more plausible that scientists would observe white ptarmigans in winter and brown ptarmigans in summer. Option B is not a correct answer as it does not relate to the given information about the color change in ptarmigans."}}
{"Q": "John is an orphan. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has no parents. (B) All anions can enter into the complexes at the same time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He has no parents.\nExplanation: Being an orphan means that John has lost both of his parents and does not have any legal guardians. This can have significant emotional, social, and financial impacts on his life. It is a serious and sensitive issue that should be handled with care and empathy. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated and irrelevant to the given question. It seems to be a scientific statement about chemical complexes and has no connection to John's situation."}}
{"Q": "The school provides nutritious meals for students. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They harvest a lot of grains every year. (B) Students can eat a lot of fruits and vegetables every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Providing nutritious meals for students would result in students being able to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables every day. This is because nutritious meals would include a variety of healthy food options, such as fruits and vegetables, which would be beneficial for the students' health and well-being. Harvesting a lot of grains every year may be a result of other factors, such as agricultural practices or climate conditions, but it is not directly related to providing nutritious meals for students."}}
{"Q": "The doctor gave him some medicine containing papain. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam suffered from constipation. (B) There is some intercellular matrix of cartilage.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Papain is an enzyme that is commonly used in medicine and supplements to aid in the digestion of proteins. It is also known to have anti-inflammatory properties and can help break down intercellular matrix of cartilage, making it a common ingredient in supplements for joint health. Therefore, it is more likely that the medicine containing papain was given to the patient for joint-related issues rather than constipation."}}
{"Q": "He needs to eat foods that are naturally high in nutrition when he is sick. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor encourages Tom to eat more raspberries. (B) His mother made lentils for him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's mother made lentils for him as they are a good source of nutrition and are easy to digest when someone is sick. While raspberries are also a nutritious food, it is less likely that the doctor specifically recommended them to Tom."}}
{"Q": "Tom helps Lucy in studying English. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They could not make food for themselves. (B) Lucy gained a great success in the English examination.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Lucy gained a great success in the English examination.\nExplanation: It is likely that Tom's help in studying English had a positive impact on Lucy's performance in her English examination. There is no indication that their studying together would prevent them from making food for themselves, so option A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom will choose nanotubes over steel. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is looking for some strong materials. (B) Tom thought duchesses had beautiful features.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom is looking for some strong materials.\nExplanation: The statement clearly mentions that Tom will choose nanotubes over steel, which implies that he is looking for a material that is stronger than steel. Option B, which talks about duchesses, is completely unrelated and does not provide any explanation for Tom's choice. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The researcher found that it was cobalt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The little boy digged out a lot of smalite. (B) The little boy digged out a bottle of liquid.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The little boy digged out a lot of smalite.\nExplanation: Smalite is a mineral that contains cobalt. Therefore, if the little boy dug out a lot of smalite, it is plausible that the researcher found cobalt as a result. On the other hand, digging out a bottle of liquid does not necessarily have any connection to cobalt."}}
{"Q": "His mucus is decreasing. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He ate a lot of vinegared dishes before driving. (B) Tom often eats pineapples.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom often eats pineapples.\nExplanation: Pineapples contain an enzyme called bromelain, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce mucus production. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's decreased mucus production is due to his regular consumption of pineapples rather than eating vinegared dishes before driving."}}
{"Q": "Joy raises a bluebird in her yard. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She needs to provide dead bugs everyday. (B) The sun exploded soon after.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: When raising a bluebird, it is necessary to provide them with a diet of insects, including live or dead mealworms, crickets, and other small bugs. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B is not related to raising a bluebird and is an unrealistic scenario."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said it was meningiomas. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has had a bad digestion recently. (B) Test revealed a something growing on his brain coverings.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The test revealed something growing on Tom's brain coverings, which is likely the cause of the meningiomas. Digestive issues would not be related to the growth of tumors on the brain."}}
{"Q": "Lila was beaned by an apple falling from the tree. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lila was sitting under an apple tree. (B) The temperature dropped below zero degrees Celsius.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lila was sitting under an apple tree.\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer because if Lila was sitting under an apple tree, it is likely that an apple fell from the tree and hit her. On the other hand, the temperature dropping below zero degrees Celsius would not cause an apple to fall from a tree and hit someone."}}
{"Q": "John compared Iridium with platinum. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) H e found both are white but Iridium has a slight yellowish cast. (B) His friend recommended naphthalene to him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: John compared Iridium with platinum and found that both are white, but Iridium has a slight yellowish cast. This is a plausible answer as it describes a possible outcome of comparing the two metals. Option B, where his friend recommends naphthalene, is not related to the comparison of Iridium and platinum and seems unlikely."}}
{"Q": "He can't control his passage of stool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was exposed to cadmiums. (B) Tom has been heavily crashed down by a car.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If Tom has been heavily crashed down by a car, it is possible that he sustained injuries to his spinal cord or nerves that control bowel movements. This can result in loss of control over the passage of stool. Exposure to cadmiums may cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but it is unlikely to cause loss of bowel control."}}
{"Q": "The doctor says it is impossible to become malignant. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) No energy is available for the dying plant anymore. (B) He is worried about his fibroadenomas will become malignant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement \"no energy is available for the dying plant anymore\" suggests that the doctor is referring to a plant, not a human. Therefore, the concept of malignancy does not apply in this context. It is plausible that a dying plant cannot become malignant because it is not a living organism with cells that can mutate and grow uncontrollably."}}
{"Q": "The seller had grown these breeds for a long time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He would sell the mature breeds. (B) He knew how they looked like.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He knew how they looked like.\nExplanation: If the seller had grown these breeds for a long time, it is likely that he would have gained knowledge and experience about their appearance, characteristics, and behavior. This would enable him to identify and differentiate between different breeds, and also help him to select the best ones for breeding or selling. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer than option A, which only states the obvious fact that the seller would sell the mature breeds."}}
{"Q": "Scientists observe hemispheres. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists have observed the aurora. (B) Scientists have observed the jet streams.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Scientists have observed the jet streams.\nExplanation: By observing the hemispheres, scientists can study the patterns and movements of the jet streams, which are high-altitude winds that play a significant role in weather patterns. The observation of auroras may also be related to the study of hemispheres, but it is not directly linked to the observation of hemispheres."}}
{"Q": "I cannot take new Photos now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Something is wrong with my camera flash. (B) Something is matched with my camera flash.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Something is wrong with my camera flash.\nExplanation: If something is wrong with the camera flash, it may not work properly and prevent the user from taking new photos. This could be due to a variety of issues such as a dead battery, a malfunctioning flash bulb, or a problem with the camera's circuitry. On the other hand, option B is not a plausible answer as it is unclear what is meant by \"something is matched with my camera flash.\""}}
{"Q": "In ancient times, ministers would write to the emperor and put forward their precious opinions for solving national issues. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He moved to their environment. (B) The emperor can solve problems for the people thoroughly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The emperor can solve problems for the people thoroughly.\nExplanation: In ancient times, the emperor was considered the ultimate authority and decision-maker in the country. Therefore, when ministers wrote to the emperor with their opinions and suggestions for solving national issues, it was expected that the emperor would carefully consider their advice and make a decision that would benefit the people. It was not common for the emperor to move to the environment of the ministers, as the emperor was usually based in the capital city and had a vast network of officials and advisors to assist him in governing the country. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It looks like rain outside. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom brings an umbrella. (B) After a while rain fell down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom brings an umbrella.\nExplanation: The statement \"It looks like rain outside\" suggests that it may rain soon. Therefore, it would be reasonable for Tom to bring an umbrella in preparation for the rain. Option B, \"After a while rain fell down,\" is not a result of the statement but rather a continuation of the weather condition."}}
{"Q": "The earth's environment is getting worse every day. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Humanity have gradually appeared on the earth. (B) Too much greenhouse gases were harmful to the environment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The excessive emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, is the primary cause of the earth's deteriorating environment. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming, climate change, and other environmental problems like melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events. While humanity's presence on earth has undoubtedly impacted the environment, the primary cause of the current environmental crisis is the excessive emission of greenhouse gases."}}
{"Q": "They found a lot food. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The hunter caught a lot of squirrels. (B) They are the first settlers on this island.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions finding a lot of food, which suggests that the food was obtained through hunting or gathering. Option A states that the hunter caught a lot of squirrels, which is a plausible explanation for finding a lot of food. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear explanation for how they obtained the food. Being the first settlers on an island does not necessarily mean that there is an abundance of food readily available."}}
{"Q": "White tails are very striking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cottontails are always caught by eagles. (B) The most impressed was the beautiful but different heads they have.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The most impressed was the beautiful but different heads they have.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that white tails are striking, which implies that they have a unique and attractive appearance. This could lead to people or animals being impressed by them, as suggested in option B. Option A, on the other hand, is unrelated and does not logically follow from the given statement."}}
{"Q": "Mumps virus is rampant in kindergartens. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jennifer unluckily develops mumps. (B) She lost the ability of nursing her baby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jennifer unluckily develops mumps.\nExplanation: Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection that spreads through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. Kindergartens are a common place for the virus to spread due to close contact between children. If Jennifer is exposed to the virus, she may contract mumps and experience symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and swollen salivary glands. Losing the ability to nurse her baby is not a common symptom of mumps and is not directly related to the virus."}}
{"Q": "The machine has some functions similar to the human minds. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They get along well with each other. (B) It can identify some obvious patterns.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: When a machine has some functions similar to the human mind, it can identify some obvious patterns. This is because the human mind is capable of recognizing patterns and making connections between seemingly unrelated things. Therefore, if a machine has similar functions, it can also identify patterns and make connections, albeit in a more limited way than a human mind. However, this does not necessarily mean that the machine will get along well with humans or other machines, as social interactions and relationships are much more complex than pattern recognition."}}
{"Q": "He bled heavily during the operation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His family thinks he can heal himself. (B) He is in urgent need of a blood transfusion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He is in urgent need of a blood transfusion.\nExplanation: Bleeding heavily during an operation can lead to a significant loss of blood, which can cause a drop in blood pressure and potentially lead to shock. A blood transfusion may be necessary to replace the lost blood and restore the patient's blood volume and oxygen-carrying capacity. It is unlikely that the patient's family would think he can heal himself in this situation, as medical intervention is typically required to address significant blood loss."}}
{"Q": "Dad planted some trees for her. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She needed a shelter. (B) Lily likes to eat small red fruit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Lily likes to eat small red fruit.\nExplanation: The fact that Dad planted trees for Lily suggests that he did so to provide her with a source of food. The mention of small red fruit further supports this idea, as it is likely that these trees bear fruit that Lily enjoys eating. The option of needing shelter is less likely, as it is not mentioned in the sentence and there is no indication that Lily was in need of shelter."}}
{"Q": "They have a spine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are blackbucks in the zoo. (B) Humans are vertebrates.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Humans are vertebrates.\nExplanation: All vertebrates, including humans, have a spine or backbone. Blackbucks being in the zoo is not relevant to the presence of a spine in animals."}}
{"Q": "He had a serious headache. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was filled with heavy pressure because of the exam. (B) The helmsman was steering the ship.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Tom's serious headache is more likely caused by the heavy pressure he was feeling due to the exam. Headaches are a common physical symptom of stress and anxiety, which can be brought on by high-pressure situations like exams. The helmsman steering the ship is not a likely cause of Tom's headache, as there is no clear connection between the two events."}}
{"Q": "The cow's yield is three versus one. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom killed a lamb and got 100 kgs of mutton and 200 kgs of fat. (B) Tom killed a cow and got 300 kgs of beef and 100 kgs of fat from the carcass.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The question is about the yield of a cow, so it is more plausible that the difference in yield is due to the cow being killed and processed for meat and fat, rather than a lamb being killed for mutton and fat. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "It has been fifteen years since the wine is bottled. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The byproduct in it should be analyzed. (B) The bottle aging of the wine is fifteen years.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The bottle aging of the wine is fifteen years.\nExplanation: When wine is bottled, it continues to age and develop in the bottle. This process is known as bottle aging. Therefore, if it has been fifteen years since the wine was bottled, it means that the wine has undergone bottle aging for fifteen years. This can have an impact on the taste, aroma, and overall quality of the wine. It is not necessary to analyze the byproduct in the wine in this case."}}
{"Q": "John's thyroid couldn't take in iodinein salt as usual. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The velocity of the car was too high. (B) John took in some thiocyanate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) John took in some thiocyanate.\nExplanation: Thiocyanate is known to inhibit the uptake of iodine by the thyroid gland. This can lead to a condition called hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland is unable to produce enough thyroid hormone. This can cause a range of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, and depression. It is important to avoid excessive intake of thiocyanate, which is found in certain foods and environmental pollutants, in order to maintain proper thyroid function."}}
{"Q": "They are extremely cautious only during drought periods. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The guards are responsible of preventing wildfire for the forest. (B) They are trappers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The guards are responsible for preventing wildfire for the forest.\n\nExplanation: During drought periods, the risk of wildfires increases significantly. Therefore, the guards responsible for preventing wildfires in the forest become extremely cautious to ensure that no fire breaks out. This is a plausible explanation for their cautious behavior during drought periods. On the other hand, the option B, \"They are trappers,\" does not seem to be related to the context and is less likely to be the cause of their cautious behavior."}}
{"Q": "Only this country has appropriate climate for this plant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many workers are toxicated. (B) This plant is only distributed here.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This plant is only distributed here.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the plant requires a specific climate to grow, and only one country has that climate. As a result, it is likely that the plant is only found and distributed in that country. There is no indication that workers are being poisoned, so option (A) is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There are more bryophytes distributed here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are some vascular plants growing here. (B) The temperature has risen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There are some vascular plants growing here.\nExplanation: Bryophytes are non-vascular plants that require moist environments to survive. Vascular plants, on the other hand, have specialized tissues that allow them to transport water and nutrients throughout their bodies, which enables them to grow in drier environments. Therefore, the presence of vascular plants in an area can create a more favorable environment for bryophytes to grow, as they can benefit from the increased moisture and shade provided by the vascular plants. The temperature alone is not a sufficient explanation for the increased distribution of bryophytes, as they require specific environmental conditions beyond just temperature to thrive."}}
{"Q": "Mary has two pieces of farmland, but only one of them is used to grow crops every year. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The often used farmland produces a lot more crops than the less often used one. (B) The less often used farmland produces more crops than the often used one.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: The farmland that is used every year is likely to have better soil quality and more nutrients, as it is constantly being replenished with crops and fertilizers. This would result in a higher yield of crops compared to the farmland that is not used as often. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He can't control his stool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He's incontinent. (B) He's hypoglycemic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He's incontinent.\nExplanation: Incontinence refers to the inability to control bowel movements, which can result in stool leakage or accidents. Hypoglycemia, on the other hand, is a condition characterized by low blood sugar levels and is not typically associated with loss of bowel control. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The experimenter intends to adjust the ionic bond. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cooperation should be enhanced. (B) The experimenters wanted to turn oxygen into an electron recipient.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Ionic bonds involve the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of ions with opposite charges that are held together by electrostatic attraction. In order to adjust the ionic bond, the experimenter would need to manipulate the transfer of electrons between the atoms involved. One possible reason for doing this could be to turn oxygen into an electron recipient, which would make it more likely to form an ionic bond with another atom that is willing to donate electrons. This could be useful in a variety of contexts, such as in the development of new materials or in the design of chemical reactions. Cooperation between atoms is not directly related to the adjustment of ionic bonds."}}
{"Q": "Long-chaine polymer molecules are elastic and attrition resistant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Esters can be processed in chemical reactions. (B) Rubber is elastic and attrition resistant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Rubber is elastic and attrition resistant.\n\nExplanation: The statement suggests that long-chain polymer molecules possess certain properties such as elasticity and resistance to wear and tear. Rubber is a well-known example of a material that exhibits these properties due to its long-chain polymer structure. Esters, on the other hand, are a class of organic compounds that can undergo chemical reactions, but this property is not directly related to the characteristics of long-chain polymer molecules. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tomatoes grow slowly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This place is warm and humid. (B) Plant tomatoes in a cold place.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Plant tomatoes in a cold place.\nExplanation: Tomatoes grow best in warm temperatures, but they also need a certain amount of cold exposure to develop properly. If they are planted in a warm and humid place, they may grow slowly or not at all. Therefore, planting tomatoes in a cold place can help them grow at a normal pace."}}
{"Q": "James died from explosion of millions of cells. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) James had smallpox. (B) James was infected by hepatitis b virus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. James had smallpox.\nExplanation: Smallpox is a highly contagious viral disease that can cause the explosion of millions of cells in the body, leading to severe symptoms such as fever, rash, and ultimately death. Hepatitis B virus, on the other hand, primarily affects the liver and does not typically cause widespread cell destruction. Therefore, smallpox is a more plausible cause of James's death in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "I find some seaweed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to drink some water. (B) I come to the Australian coastal water to have fun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Seaweed is a natural occurrence in coastal waters and is not directly related to someone wanting to drink water. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the person came to the coastal water for recreational purposes and stumbled upon the seaweed."}}
{"Q": "These grapes got fermentation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She sealed these grapes in the bottle. (B) She put these grape on the table.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She sealed these grapes in the bottle.\nExplanation: Fermentation occurs when yeast or bacteria consume the sugars in grapes and produce alcohol and carbon dioxide. By sealing the grapes in a bottle, the yeast or bacteria are trapped inside with the sugars, allowing fermentation to occur. Leaving the grapes on a table would not necessarily lead to fermentation as the yeast or bacteria needed for fermentation may not be present in the environment."}}
{"Q": "Dogs have sharp teeth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They open their jaws when they encounter tough bones. (B) The skeleton shows that their teeth are very special.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Dogs have sharp teeth to help them tear and chew their food, especially tough meat and bones. When they encounter tough bones, they open their jaws wide to get a better grip and use their sharp teeth to break them down into smaller pieces that they can swallow. This behavior is a direct result of their sharp teeth and is a common sight in dogs. On the other hand, the skeleton of a dog may show that their teeth are special, but it is not a direct result of their sharp teeth."}}
{"Q": "They grow new leaves in spring. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He grows many canes. (B) The gardener was hired to take care of my poinsettias.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He grows many canes.\nExplanation: Poinsettias are deciduous plants, meaning they lose their leaves in the fall and grow new ones in the spring. The fact that the plant grows new leaves in the spring is a natural process and is not related to the gardener being hired to take care of the plant. Choice A is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the plant has many canes, which is a characteristic of poinsettias, and can contribute to the growth of new leaves."}}
{"Q": "The judge held that he had committed a crime for his action and sentenced him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The general's surrender was regarded as an shameful action. (B) Bob argued to the judge that he had no intention of killing though he put a knife around the victims's neck.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: The sentence \"The general's surrender was regarded as a shameful action\" suggests that Bob's action was related to the general's surrender. It is possible that Bob's action was seen as dishonoring the general's surrender or violating some code of conduct related to it, leading to the judge's decision that he had committed a crime. On the other hand, choice B does not provide a convincing reason for the judge's decision, as putting a knife around someone's neck is generally considered a threatening and violent act regardless of the intention behind it."}}
{"Q": "He suckled it via intuition. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The infant was provided with a nipple. (B) Tony did not know the meaning of love.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The infant was provided with a nipple.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the infant was able to breastfeed through Tony's intuition, which implies that the infant had access to a nipple. Option B, which suggests that Tony's lack of knowledge about love caused him to suckle the infant, is not a plausible explanation as it is not related to the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought clothes in the same shop again. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is fashion. (B) The clthes are in different styles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The clothes are in different styles.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tom bought clothes in different styles from the same shop rather than him being fashion just because he shopped there again. The fact that he went back to the same shop could indicate that he likes the quality or selection of clothes offered by that shop, but it doesn't necessarily mean he only buys one particular style."}}
{"Q": "Mike's father was doing rehabilitation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It shows that Mike's father achieved the maximum functional potential after the process. (B) Mike's father had a worse condition after the process.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Rehabilitation is a process that aims to improve a person's physical, mental, and emotional well-being after an illness or injury. Therefore, it is more likely that Mike's father achieved the maximum functional potential after the process rather than having a worse condition. The purpose of rehabilitation is to help patients regain their independence and improve their quality of life, so it is reasonable to assume that Mike's father benefited from the process."}}
{"Q": "Black ink in Jack's pen went out. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can't write with this pen. (B) He also found that deflation had set in.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He can't write with this pen.\nExplanation: When the black ink in Jack's pen went out, it means that the pen is no longer able to produce black ink, making it impossible for Jack to write with it. Option B, which suggests that deflation had set in, is not related to the situation and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom's rabbits are dead. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom feeds his rabbits carrots. (B) Tom's rabbits have hairballs in their stomaches.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom's rabbits have hairballs in their stomachs.\nExplanation: While feeding rabbits carrots is a common misconception, it is not a likely cause of death. However, hairballs in a rabbit's stomach can be fatal if left untreated. Rabbits are known for grooming themselves frequently, and if they ingest too much fur, it can form a blockage in their digestive system. This can lead to a lack of appetite, lethargy, and eventually death. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's rabbits died due to hairballs in their stomachs."}}
{"Q": "Merchants built cabins in the mountains to facilitate trade. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These cabins are now historic buildings. (B) There was no phosphate precipitation of iron.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. These cabins are now historic buildings.\nExplanation: Over time, these cabins became important landmarks and historical sites, as they played a significant role in facilitating trade and commerce in the mountains. Many of these cabins have been preserved and are now considered important cultural and historical artifacts. On the other hand, phosphate precipitation of iron is a chemical process that has no direct relation to the construction of cabins in the mountains."}}
{"Q": "I am a good dancer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I feel energetic. (B) I have rotational inertia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Dancing is a physical activity that requires movement and coordination. When someone is a good dancer, they are likely to feel energetic because they are using their body in a way that is enjoyable and stimulating. Additionally, dancing can release endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters that can increase feelings of happiness and well-being. On the other hand, rotational inertia is a property of objects that describes their resistance to changes in rotational motion, and it is not directly related to dancing ability."}}
{"Q": "Vaccines brought circulating defense agent against the disease for his immune system. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Vaccines activiated antobodies in Tom's body. (B) One patient was so sick that he had repeated infections.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Vaccines activated antibodies in Tom's body.\nExplanation: Vaccines work by introducing a weakened or dead form of a virus or bacteria into the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against it. These antibodies then circulate in the body and provide protection against future infections by the same pathogen. Therefore, it is more plausible that the vaccines activated antibodies in Tom's body, rather than one patient being so sick that he had repeated infections."}}
{"Q": "The students was majoring in optics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He studies a lt about  the dispersion of light. (B) He has been the best student in the class with the highest skill level.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If a student is majoring in optics, it is more likely that they will study a lot about the dispersion of light and other related topics. It does not necessarily mean that they will automatically be the best student in the class with the highest skill level. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a persistent abdominal pain. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom swallowed a large amount of laxative by mistake. (B) The bananas Tom bought are a bit underripe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Abdominal pain is a common symptom of indigestion, which can be caused by eating underripe bananas. Swallowing a large amount of laxative by mistake can also cause abdominal pain, but it is less likely to occur than indigestion from underripe bananas."}}
{"Q": "Tom is very envious of the job as jailers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He often has fatigue in his eyes. (B) They only need to guard prisoners every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They only need to guard prisoners every day.\n\nExplanation: Envy is a feeling of wanting something that someone else has. In this case, Tom is envious of the job as jailers. The result of this envy would not be physical fatigue in his eyes, but rather a desire to have the job himself. Option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the job of a jailer involves only guarding prisoners every day, which may be seen as an easy or desirable job by some."}}
{"Q": "Mary was diagnosed with lymphopenia yesterday. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary gets many images. (B) Her immune system has weakened since last month.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Her immune system has weakened since last month.\nExplanation: Lymphopenia is a condition where the body has a low level of lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system. A weakened immune system is a common consequence of lymphopenia, as the body is less able to fight off infections and diseases. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) is not related to lymphopenia and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "He is looking for bowls. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mario feels thirsty. (B) Mario feels hungry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Mario feels hungry.\nExplanation: Bowls are typically used for serving food, so it is more likely that Mario is looking for bowls because he is feeling hungry and wants to eat something. If he was feeling thirsty, he would more likely be looking for a glass or a water bottle."}}
{"Q": "Ozone has drastically reduced. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Humans produce lots of halons today. (B) Tom has ate some medicines containing antimetabolites.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Ozone depletion is primarily caused by the release of human-made chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, which break down ozone molecules in the stratosphere. While antimetabolites can have negative effects on human health, they do not directly contribute to ozone depletion."}}
{"Q": "He got some rum. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He went to a cllege. (B) The worker fremented some sugar cane with yeast.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The worker fermented some sugar cane with yeast.\nExplanation: Rum is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane byproducts, such as molasses or sugarcane juice, that are fermented and then distilled. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer as it describes the process of making rum. Option (A) is not related to the production of rum and is an irrelevant choice."}}
{"Q": "The porridge became hot. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Peter put hydrochloric acid into the solution. (B) Tom put his porridge into the microwave oven.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom put his porridge into the microwave oven.\nExplanation: The most plausible cause of the porridge becoming hot is that it was heated in a microwave oven. Choice A, which suggests that hydrochloric acid was added to the porridge, is not a likely cause of the porridge becoming hot as hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can cause burns and damage to materials. Therefore, choice B is the more reasonable explanation."}}
{"Q": "The man drove to the park. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He saw one hump in dromedaries and two humps in camels. (B) He parked his car in the park.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He parked his car in the park.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the sentence states that the man drove to the park, which implies that he intended to park his car there. Seeing humps in dromedaries and camels is not related to the action of driving to the park and is therefore less likely to be the result of the man's actions."}}
{"Q": "There are a lot of children here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This is a rich area. (B) It is sunny outside.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It is sunny outside.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cause of there being a lot of children is due to the weather being sunny outside. Children are more likely to be outside and playing when the weather is nice, rather than the wealth of the area determining the number of children present."}}
{"Q": "Tom's whole lungs have shadows. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor asked Tom to do a pneumonectomy. (B) When he went to the hospital to do physical examination, his lung has been filled with shadow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: When a person's whole lungs have shadows, it is usually an indication of a serious medical condition such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. In this case, it is likely that Tom went to the hospital for a physical examination and the shadows were detected on his lung. The doctor would then need to conduct further tests to determine the cause of the shadows and recommend appropriate treatment. A pneumonectomy, which is the surgical removal of a lung, would only be considered as a last resort if other treatments are not effective."}}
{"Q": "Many pirates were attracted for the piratical chests. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The secret of bales were hidden in the prince's room. (B) Their group of pirates often roam this part of the sea.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The secret of bales refers to the treasure chests that were often filled with valuable goods such as gold, silver, and jewels. Pirates were attracted to these chests because they could potentially make a fortune by stealing them. On the other hand, choice B does not provide a clear reason for why pirates would be attracted to the area."}}
{"Q": "Three american families wil benefit from it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alcoholism is encouraged. (B) A ban was imposed on alcoholism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. A ban was imposed on alcoholism.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that three American families will benefit from a certain event or policy. Since alcoholism is harmful and destructive, it is unlikely that it would be encouraged. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that a ban was imposed on alcoholism, which would lead to fewer people suffering from its negative effects and potentially benefiting the families of those who struggle with addiction."}}
{"Q": "The zipper almost blends in with the skirt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has bought a Geese brand down jacket. (B) Emily likes this skirt very much.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The cause of the zipper almost blending in with the skirt is likely due to the design and color of the skirt, which Emily likes very much. It is unlikely that the brand of a down jacket purchased by Tom would have any impact on the appearance of the zipper on a skirt."}}
{"Q": "The flower didn't grow well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The gardener implant the flower into another place. (B) This flower's carpel was damaged.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This flower's carpel was damaged.\nExplanation: The carpel is an essential part of a flower's reproductive system, and if it is damaged, the flower may not grow properly or produce seeds. Therefore, it is more plausible that the damaged carpel was the cause of the flower not growing well rather than the gardener transplanting it to another location."}}
{"Q": "He used aoudad as an example to show the students. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob realizes the importance of learning. (B) The biology teacher said that many creatures have a strong ability to adapt to the environment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The biology teacher said that many creatures have a strong ability to adapt to the environment.\nExplanation: The use of aoudad as an example by the teacher suggests that they were discussing the topic of adaptation in class. Aoudad is a species of sheep that is known for its ability to adapt to harsh environments, such as the desert. Therefore, the teacher likely used this example to illustrate how certain animals have evolved to survive in extreme conditions."}}
{"Q": "The cardamoms got dried and died when he came back. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim lost his pause this morning. (B) Mario didn't add water to the cardamoms when he was on business.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because cardamoms require moisture to stay alive and fresh. If Mario didn't add water to the cardamoms while he was away on business, they would have dried out and died. Jim losing his pause has no correlation with the cardamoms dying."}}
{"Q": "Many vesicles appear on his back and arms. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jasin gets affected by acute dermatitis. (B) Jack jumped out of the plane.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jasin gets affected by acute dermatitis.\nExplanation: Acute dermatitis is a skin condition that can cause vesicles or blisters to appear on the skin. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including exposure to irritants or allergens, infections, or autoimmune disorders. Jumping out of a plane would not cause vesicles to appear on the skin, but acute dermatitis could be a likely cause."}}
{"Q": "No chemical in the environment can enter his body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The alien has access to water, air  and dust. (B) Tom always has convulsions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The alien has access to water, air and dust.\nExplanation: It is not biologically possible for a living organism to completely prevent any chemical from entering its body. Therefore, option B is not a plausible answer. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that the alien has access to basic environmental elements such as water, air, and dust, which are essential for survival but do not necessarily contain harmful chemicals. This could explain why no harmful chemicals have entered the alien's body."}}
{"Q": "White seemed to be selfish. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) White took all useful tools alone. (B) Tom was at a loss about his future.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: The fact that White took all useful tools alone suggests that he was only thinking about himself and not considering the needs of others. This behavior is indicative of selfishness. On the other hand, Tom being at a loss about his future may have contributed to his own personal struggles, but it does not necessarily explain White's selfish behavior."}}
{"Q": "Quantitative values are needed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The students calculated the sum of the squares of the differences between each statistic and their average and divided it by the number of statistics. (B) We must understand the mathematics.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The students calculated the sum of the squares of the differences between each statistic and their average and divided it by the number of statistics. This process is known as calculating the variance, which is a quantitative measure of how spread out a set of data is. Therefore, in order to obtain quantitative values, the students needed to calculate the variance."}}
{"Q": "It damaged his heart on many different parts. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has a lung problem. (B) He was caught by a disease.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was caught by a disease.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the damage to his heart was caused by a disease, rather than a lung problem. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This substance cannot pass through the bronchi. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This substance cannot pass through the bronchioles. (B) This substance cannot enter the lungs through breathing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: If a substance cannot pass through the bronchi, it means it cannot enter the lungs through the main airways. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer. The bronchioles are smaller airways within the lungs, and if a substance cannot pass through the bronchi, it is unlikely to reach the bronchioles."}}
{"Q": "Students observe the cytoplasm in biology class. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The students see the organelles. (B) Biology students have observed smooth muscle and less elastic tissue.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The students see the organelles.\nExplanation: Cytoplasm is the gel-like substance that fills the cell and contains various organelles such as mitochondria, ribosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, observing the cytoplasm would allow students to see these organelles and learn about their functions. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to observing the cytoplasm and seems out of context."}}
{"Q": "Only the queens are able to lay eggs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many bees are infertile. (B) Other bees have no reproductive organs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Other bees have no reproductive organs.\n\nExplanation: Male bees, also known as drones, have reproductive organs but they do not have the ability to lay eggs. Female worker bees have underdeveloped reproductive organs and are not able to lay fertilized eggs. Only the queen bee has fully developed reproductive organs and is able to lay eggs. Therefore, the cause of only queens being able to lay eggs is due to the fact that other bees, except for the queen, have no or underdeveloped reproductive organs."}}
{"Q": "These jellyfishes lived together. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They died after different years. (B) They thrived with amazing reproduction rate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They thrived with amazing reproduction rate.\nExplanation: Jellyfishes are known to reproduce rapidly, and living together in a group can provide them with a better chance of survival and reproduction. This is because they can share resources and protect each other from predators. Therefore, it is more plausible that they thrived with an amazing reproduction rate rather than dying after different years."}}
{"Q": "He can catch hundreds of jin of fish every month. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has eaten a lot of statins. (B) He's the best fisherman around here.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He's the best fisherman around here.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's ability to catch a large amount of fish every month is due to his skills as a fisherman rather than him eating statins. Statins are a type of medication used to lower cholesterol levels and have no known effect on fishing abilities. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely cause of Tom's success in catching fish."}}
{"Q": "She has a dominant position in large group. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy is a female bonobo. (B) Lenoes love to be a part of a group.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy is a female bonobo.\nExplanation: Bonobos are known for their matriarchal social structure, where females hold dominant positions in the group. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy's dominant position is due to her being a female bonobo rather than Lenoes loving to be a part of a group, which is a generalization and not specific to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Dispersal is very common. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A lot of offspring moves away from their parents. (B) The viscosity of the fluid with strong flow is lower than the one of the fluid with weak flow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A lot of offspring moves away from their parents.\n\nExplanation: Dispersal refers to the movement of individuals or offspring away from their original location or parent population. This is a common phenomenon in many species, as it allows for the colonization of new habitats, the avoidance of competition and inbreeding, and the spread of genetic diversity. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer than option B, which refers to the physical properties of fluids and is not related to the topic of dispersal."}}
{"Q": "It got gentle yellow feathers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is a little cygnets which is only one-month old. (B) A hummingbird went out for food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It is a little cygnets which is only one-month old.\nExplanation: Young swans, or cygnets, have yellowish-gray feathers when they are born. As they grow, their feathers gradually turn white. At one month old, cygnets still have some yellow feathers mixed in with their gray ones. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B, about a hummingbird, is not related to the color of the feathers and is unlikely to be the cause."}}
{"Q": "Tom and Lucy majoring anatomies are partners. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They always had an argument. (B) They always had a perfect cooperation in the operation process.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom and Lucy, who are both majoring in anatomies, would have a perfect cooperation in the operation process. As partners, they would need to work together efficiently and effectively to ensure the success of their operations. While disagreements may arise, it is unlikely that they would always have arguments as this would hinder their ability to work together and achieve their goals."}}
{"Q": "The fake doctor could only recognize iodine deficiency from the most visible sign. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was certain about the illness of patients with Goiters. (B) People inside faced great inconvenience.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. People inside faced great inconvenience.\nExplanation: Since the fake doctor could only recognize iodine deficiency from the most visible sign, which is goiter, he may have misdiagnosed other illnesses that have similar symptoms. This could lead to incorrect treatment and potentially worsen the condition of the patients. Additionally, patients who did not have goiters but had iodine deficiency may have gone undiagnosed and untreated, leading to further health complications. Therefore, people inside faced great inconvenience due to the fake doctor's limited knowledge and ability to diagnose illnesses."}}
{"Q": "The biosphere is out of balance. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The number of beavers become rampant. (B) The environment becomes better.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The environment becomes better.\nExplanation: When the biosphere is out of balance, it means that there is an imbalance in the natural systems that support life on Earth. This can lead to negative consequences such as habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, and climate change. However, if steps are taken to restore balance to the biosphere, such as reducing pollution and protecting natural habitats, the environment can improve and become healthier for all living organisms. The increase in the number of beavers is not necessarily a direct result of the biosphere being out of balance, and it is unlikely to be the only consequence."}}
{"Q": "He wants to rest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is running. (B) Jack eats a very healthy and balanced diet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He is running.\nExplanation: Running is a physical activity that requires a lot of energy and can cause fatigue. It is common for people who engage in running to feel tired and in need of rest afterwards. On the other hand, Jack's diet may contribute to his overall health and well-being, but it is not directly related to his need for rest in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "He wants to go home quickly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is hungry. (B) It's hot outside.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He is hungry.\nExplanation: The fact that he wants to go home quickly suggests that he has a pressing need or desire that can only be fulfilled at home. Being hungry is a more plausible reason than it being hot outside, as hunger is a basic human need that can cause discomfort and distraction. On the other hand, while heat can be uncomfortable, it is not necessarily urgent or compelling enough to make someone want to rush home."}}
{"Q": "Tom tries to stay away from puddles in summer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to dig out some gold out of a permafrost area in summer. (B) Tom hates mosquitoes very much.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom hates mosquitoes very much. Puddles are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and in summer, they are more prevalent. Therefore, Tom tries to stay away from puddles to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes. Option A is not related to the given information and seems unlikely."}}
{"Q": "The boy separated two solutions of different concentrations with a membrane. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found cassiterite, carbon and Tin. (B) The osmosis occures.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The osmosis occurred.\n\nExplanation: When two solutions of different concentrations are separated by a membrane, the process of osmosis occurs. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration through a semi-permeable membrane. This movement of water molecules continues until the concentration of water molecules on both sides of the membrane becomes equal. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer. Option (A) is not related to the process of separating solutions with a membrane."}}
{"Q": "He felt fainted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was exposed to the sunshine for a long time in summer. (B) The patient was given a lot of diuretics.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The administration of diuretics can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to fainting. Exposure to the sun for a long time can also cause dehydration, but it is less likely to cause fainting unless accompanied by other factors such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The geranium looks vigorous with verdurous leafs and brilliant flowers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa places the geraniums in the bright sunny balcony. . (B) Lisa waters the geranium in the balcony every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The geranium's vigor and brilliant flowers are likely due to Lisa placing them in a bright sunny balcony. Geraniums thrive in full sun and need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day to grow and bloom well. While watering is important, it alone cannot account for the plant's overall health and appearance."}}
{"Q": "The sperm from one sponge fused with the egg from the other to achive fertilization. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists are studying between which cells the sperm is produced. (B) Both sponges kept in this tank produced eggs and sperms.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that both sponges kept in the same tank produced eggs and sperms, which allowed for fertilization to occur between the two sponges. This is a common occurrence in many aquatic animals that release their gametes into the water, where they can mix and fertilize with gametes from other individuals. Option A is not relevant to the given scenario and does not explain the observed fertilization."}}
{"Q": "My albatross is pregnant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It needs to be strong enough for the birth of its children. (B) It needs to be fat enough for the birth of its children.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It needs to be fat enough for the birth of its children.\nExplanation: When a female albatross is pregnant, she needs to have enough fat reserves to sustain herself and her developing chick during the long incubation period. Albatrosses lay only one egg per breeding season, and the incubation period can last up to 80 days. During this time, the female albatross will not leave the nest to feed, relying solely on her fat reserves to survive. Therefore, it is crucial for the female albatross to be fat enough to sustain herself and her chick until it is ready to fledge."}}
{"Q": "He choked again seriously. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He saw a creature with big mouth and small head. (B) He kind of choked a few seconds ago.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He kind of choked a few seconds ago.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cause of his choking again is related to his previous choking episode. It is possible that he did not fully recover from the previous choking and still had some food or obstruction in his airway, leading to another choking episode. On the other hand, seeing a creature with a big mouth and small head seems unlikely to cause choking unless it was a sudden and extreme shock that caused him to gasp and inhale something."}}
{"Q": "He will be fine as long as catch a whale. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This orcas seems going to die for hunger. (B) This orcas seems going to die for shooting by the hunters.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This orcas seems going to die for hunger.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the orcas will be fine as long as it catches a whale, which implies that the orcas is currently facing a food shortage. Option A, which states that the orcas seems to be dying of hunger, is a more plausible explanation for the situation than option B, which suggests that the orcas is being hunted."}}
{"Q": "The floc was finally removed after a night. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sedimentation was used by Stephen to separate substances in solution. (B) Stephen concentrated protein by dialysis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sedimentation was used by Stephen to separate substances in solution.\n\nExplanation: Sedimentation is a process of separating substances in a solution based on their density. In this case, the floc was likely composed of larger, denser particles that settled to the bottom of the solution overnight. Stephen may have used sedimentation to remove the floc from the solution, allowing for a clearer liquid to be obtained. Dialysis, on the other hand, is a process of separating substances based on their size and charge, and would not be an appropriate method for removing floc from a solution. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom suffered from the lung cancer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His blood vessel was heavily blocked. (B) He can't have a deep breath.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He can't have a deep breath.\nExplanation: Lung cancer can cause a blockage or narrowing of the airways, making it difficult for the person to take deep breaths. This can lead to shortness of breath, wheezing, and other respiratory symptoms. While lung cancer can also affect blood vessels, causing blockages or clots, this is not necessarily a common or immediate result of the disease."}}
{"Q": "His mom was satisfied about his health. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Black's mother said that Black should have a good habit. (B) The child started to drink juices regularly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The child started to drink juices regularly.\nExplanation: Drinking juices regularly can have a positive impact on one's health, providing essential vitamins and nutrients. Therefore, it is plausible that Black's mother was satisfied with his health because he started to drink juices regularly. Choice (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any specific information about Black's health."}}
{"Q": "Rachel's mother bought her a pot of calyx. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The ermine is hungry. (B) Rachel wants to raise a special green plant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Rachel wants to raise a special green plant, as calyx is a type of plant. The fact that Rachel's mother bought her the pot of calyx suggests that Rachel has an interest in gardening or plants, and her mother is supporting that interest by providing her with the necessary materials. Option A, which suggests that the ermine is hungry, is not related to the information given in the question and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Amy hates hurricanes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She never touches chemicals like plastics, lubricants, gasoline and so on. (B) She doesn't like summer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She doesn't like summer.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Amy's dislike of hurricanes would lead to her not enjoying summer, as hurricane season typically falls during the summer months. It is unlikely that her dislike of hurricanes would lead to her avoiding chemicals like plastics, lubricants, and gasoline."}}
{"Q": "Other countries looked up to its position. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) On December 16, 1902, the eruption of Mount Peree in the West Indies shook the world. (B) Rome is a great empire.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Rome was a great empire known for its military prowess, cultural achievements, and political power. Its influence extended far beyond its borders, and many other countries looked up to its position as a dominant world power. The Roman Empire was admired for its stability, infrastructure, and advancements in areas such as law, engineering, and architecture. Its legacy continues to be felt today in many aspects of modern society. On the other hand, the eruption of Mount Pelee in 1902 was a significant event, but it did not have the same lasting impact on the world as the Roman Empire."}}
{"Q": "Tom cuts off all the leaves of an apple tree. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The apple tree stops growing and dies soon. (B) He succeeded.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The apple tree stops growing and dies soon.\nExplanation: Leaves are essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants produce food. Without leaves, the apple tree cannot produce food, and as a result, it will stop growing and eventually die. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Archaeologists have discovered a fossil from Devonian period. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Archaeologists have discovered that poppies were used two thousand years ago. (B) This is a shark fossil.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The given information about the discovery of a fossil from the Devonian period suggests that it is related to prehistoric marine life. Therefore, option B, which identifies the fossil as a shark fossil, is a more plausible answer than option A, which talks about the use of poppies in the past."}}
{"Q": "The aspens were exposed to pesticides. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have different characteristics. (B) They had responses instantly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They have different characteristics.\nExplanation: Exposure to pesticides can cause changes in the genetic makeup of plants, leading to altered characteristics such as growth rate, leaf shape, and color. These changes may not be immediate and can take time to manifest. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests an immediate response."}}
{"Q": "There were lots of herring eggbeds here yesterday,. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Today they've been eaten by yellowtail fishing. (B) The eggs are ready to be eaten.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Today they've been eaten by yellowtail fishing.\nExplanation: Herring eggs are a popular food source for many marine animals, including yellowtail fish. Therefore, it is more plausible that the eggs were eaten by yellowtail fishing rather than being ready to be eaten. Additionally, if the eggs were ready to be eaten, it is unlikely that they would have all disappeared in one day."}}
{"Q": "He can always recommend the right medicine to the patient. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The pharmacist in the drugstore is very professional. (B) Tom is a pharmacist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the ability to recommend the right medicine to the patient is that Tom is a pharmacist. As a trained and licensed healthcare professional, Tom has the knowledge and expertise to identify the appropriate medication for a patient's condition and provide dosage instructions and other relevant information. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A may be a contributing factor, but it does not fully explain Tom's ability to recommend the right medicine."}}
{"Q": "Jack suffered from juvenile arthritis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His movement is restricted. (B) He has been suffering from diarrhea recently.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His movement is restricted.\nExplanation: Juvenile arthritis is a condition that causes inflammation in the joints, which can lead to pain, stiffness, and swelling. As a result, it can limit a person's ability to move and perform daily activities. Diarrhea is not a common symptom of juvenile arthritis, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "It started to swim. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I saw a midge. (B) The little guppy first left its mother's body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The little guppy swimming after leaving its mother's body is a more plausible explanation for it starting to swim than simply seeing a midge. Midge sightings would not necessarily cause a fish to start swimming. However, it is natural for a fish to start swimming after being born and leaving its mother's body."}}
{"Q": "The doctor advised him to eat food rich in polyunsaturates. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cholesterol level in his blood is above the normal range. (B) His intake of magnesium has been insufficient for a long time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The cholesterol level in his blood is above the normal range.\nExplanation: Polyunsaturated fats are known to help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels in the blood, which can reduce the risk of heart disease. Therefore, if the doctor advised him to eat food rich in polyunsaturates, it is likely that his cholesterol level is above the normal range and needs to be lowered. Magnesium intake is not directly related to polyunsaturated fats, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Tom's cells began to proliferate uncontrollably. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has lung cancer. (B) Tom's father's blood pressure dropped because of too much blood transfusion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has lung cancer.\nExplanation: Uncontrolled cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer. Lung cancer is a type of cancer that can cause cells to proliferate uncontrollably in the lungs. On the other hand, Tom's father's blood pressure dropping due to too much blood transfusion is not directly related to uncontrolled cell proliferation."}}
{"Q": "He found that was a capuchin. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has met a monkey with a opposable thumb. (B) The researchers dissected a perch.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has met a monkey with an opposable thumb.\nExplanation: Capuchin monkeys are known for their opposable thumbs, which allow them to grasp and manipulate objects with great dexterity. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom identified the monkey as a capuchin because he observed its opposable thumb, rather than the researchers dissecting a perch having any connection to the monkey's identification."}}
{"Q": "He utilized interleukins to connect them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The researcher had to made chains of different numbers of  antibody molecules. (B) The doctor found that the cells on Tom's arm began to move inwards.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Interleukins are signaling molecules that are involved in the immune response. They can be used to connect different antibody molecules together to form chains, which can be useful in various research and diagnostic applications. There is no indication in the given information that interleukins were used to treat a medical condition, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom fainted on the mountain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom had edema and erythema on his arm. (B) The doctor diagnosed him as acrophobia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Fainting on a mountain can be a sign of altitude sickness, which can cause edema (swelling) and erythema (redness) in the affected area. Acrophobia is a fear of heights and would not be a likely diagnosis in this situation."}}
{"Q": "Her eyes are affected. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy suffers from diabetes. (B) Sophia has some small spherical opaque white protrusions on her face.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy suffers from diabetes.\nExplanation: Diabetes can cause damage to the blood vessels in the eyes, leading to various eye problems such as diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy's eye problems are caused by her diabetes rather than Sophia's small spherical opaque white protrusions on her face."}}
{"Q": "The doctor prescribed him medicine for frostbite. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) In the cold wind, the listening ability of his ears was damaged. (B) In the cold wind, the epidermis tissue of his ears was damaged.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. In the cold wind, the epidermis tissue of his ears was damaged.\n\nExplanation: Frostbite occurs when the skin and underlying tissues freeze due to exposure to cold temperatures. In this case, the doctor prescribed medicine for frostbite, indicating that the person's skin and tissues were damaged. Option B correctly identifies that the epidermis tissue of his ears was damaged due to exposure to cold wind. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that the person's listening ability was damaged, which is not related to frostbite. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He could face the common tantrums. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was ready to have a kid. (B) Jack's family cultivated his good habits.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jack's family cultivated his good habits.\nExplanation: If Jack's family cultivated his good habits, it is likely that he was taught how to handle his emotions and tantrums in a healthy way. Therefore, he would be better equipped to handle common tantrums that may arise. On the other hand, Tom being ready to have a kid does not necessarily mean he knows how to handle tantrums, so option A is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Tom feels dizzy while working in the office. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mom supervised him to exercise. (B) Colleagues opened the window for him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Colleagues opened the window for him.\nExplanation: If Tom feels dizzy while working in the office, it is possible that the air in the room is stale or there is poor ventilation. Opening the window can help improve the air quality and provide fresh air, which may alleviate Tom's dizziness. It is unlikely that his mom would supervise him to exercise as a solution to his dizziness while he is at work."}}
{"Q": "Luna cares about her dog. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Luna got a collie. (B) Sean has a pet dog.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Luna got a collie.\nExplanation: Luna's acquisition of a collie suggests that she intentionally chose to bring a dog into her life, indicating that she likely cares about the well-being of animals. Additionally, the act of getting a pet requires a certain level of responsibility and commitment, further supporting the idea that Luna cares about her dog. On the other hand, the fact that Sean has a pet dog does not necessarily have any direct impact on Luna's feelings towards her own dog."}}
{"Q": "They don't have enough food to fill their stomaches. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Vagrants are impecunious. (B) The girl already knew what caused styes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Vagrants are impecunious.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the reason for not having enough food is related to being impecunious, which means having little or no money. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the lack of resources to buy food. Option B is irrelevant and does not provide any explanation for the given situation."}}
{"Q": "The safety of the roadways was under greater threats of speeding cars. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The traffic was very busy on the city streets. (B) All radars on the road were broken.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The traffic was very busy on the city streets.\nExplanation: When the traffic is busy on the city streets, drivers may become impatient and try to speed to get to their destination faster. This can lead to a greater threat to the safety of the roadways. On the other hand, if all radars on the road were broken, it would not necessarily lead to an increase in speeding cars as there would be no way to detect and enforce speed limits."}}
{"Q": "Tom always wore very few clothes when he was young. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His heat loss from the skin decreased. (B) He has a varicocele.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His heat loss from the skin decreased.\nExplanation: When a person wears fewer clothes, their body loses heat more easily through the skin. This can lead to hypothermia or other health problems. However, if Tom always wore very few clothes when he was young, his body may have adapted to the cold by decreasing the amount of heat lost through the skin. This is known as acclimatization. Therefore, it is more plausible that his heat loss from the skin decreased rather than him developing a varicocele, which is a condition that affects the veins in the scrotum and is not related to clothing choices."}}
{"Q": "The child mistook the chameleon for a lizard. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mother took the children to see the chameleon. (B) We went on a trip to the woods.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mother took the children to see the chameleon.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the child mistook the chameleon for a lizard because they were shown the chameleon by their mother, who may not have explained the difference between the two reptiles. Going on a trip to the woods would not necessarily lead to mistaking a chameleon for a lizard, as chameleons are not typically found in wooded areas."}}
{"Q": "The sun shines bright like a diamound. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The snowfall is coming. (B) Plants is conducting photosynthesis and grow stronger.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Plants is conducting photosynthesis and grow stronger.\nExplanation: When the sun shines bright, it provides the necessary energy for plants to conduct photosynthesis, which is the process of converting sunlight into energy. This energy is used by plants to grow stronger and produce more leaves, flowers, and fruits. Therefore, it is more plausible that the sun shining bright would result in plants conducting photosynthesis and growing stronger, rather than snowfall coming."}}
{"Q": "This was originally a heath. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It saw the death of many cranes. (B) There used to be many animal species.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. There used to be many animal species.\nExplanation: As a heath, the area would have been a natural habitat for a variety of animal species. However, if the heath was converted or developed for human use, such as for agriculture or urbanization, it could have resulted in the loss of habitat and a decline in animal populations. This is a more plausible answer than option A, which is specific to one type of bird species and may not necessarily be related to the conversion of the heath."}}
{"Q": "The parliament changed their decisions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Citizens were not satisfied with the statutes. (B) Brucellosis has invaded this country.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that citizens were not satisfied with the statutes and expressed their dissatisfaction to their representatives, leading to a change in decision. Brucellosis, a bacterial infection that affects livestock, is not a likely cause for a change in parliamentary decisions."}}
{"Q": "John wants to catch some sparrows. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John laid a trap on the edge of the cliff. (B) John laid a trap on the edge of the lake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John laid a trap on the edge of the cliff.\nExplanation: Sparrows are small birds that are commonly found in trees and bushes. They are not typically found near bodies of water like lakes. Therefore, it is more plausible that John would lay a trap on the edge of a cliff where sparrows are more likely to be found."}}
{"Q": "The water in the lake evaporates a lot in the hot summer weather. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Geese usually build their nests near the water. (B) A few days later, it rained heavily in this area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: When water evaporates from a lake, it means that the water level decreases. This can lead to a decrease in the amount of water available for animals to drink or for plants to grow. It is unlikely that geese would build their nests near the water if the water level is low. On the other hand, a decrease in water level due to evaporation can also lead to drought conditions, which can increase the likelihood of heavy rainfall in the future. Therefore, it is more plausible that a few days later, it rained heavily in the area due to the evaporation of water from the lake."}}
{"Q": "This led to his getting worse and suffering from cancer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack's research work exposed him to radium radiation for a long time. (B) Frank was diagnosed with melanomas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jack's research work exposed him to radium radiation for a long time.\nExplanation: Exposure to radium radiation for a long time can lead to the development of cancer. This is a well-known fact in the scientific community, and it is highly plausible that Jack's research work, which involved exposure to radium radiation, led to his worsening health and eventual diagnosis of cancer. On the other hand, option B is not related to Jack's condition and is therefore an unlikely cause."}}
{"Q": "The factory discharges sewage into the sea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Most of the males are leaders and most of the females who are excellent as those males are general workers. (B) The marine environment has been destroyed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The marine environment has been destroyed.\n\nExplanation: Discharging sewage into the sea can have a significant impact on the marine environment. Sewage contains harmful pollutants and nutrients that can cause eutrophication, which leads to the growth of harmful algae and the depletion of oxygen in the water. This can result in the death of marine life and the destruction of habitats. Therefore, it is more plausible that the discharge of sewage into the sea would result in the destruction of the marine environment rather than affecting the gender distribution of workers in a factory."}}
{"Q": "Tom put a bottle of water with 50% contaminants and 50% pathogens in his room three days ago. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found the water became sweeter. (B) Now the contaminants in the bottle are 80%.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Now the contaminants in the bottle are 80%.\nExplanation: Over time, the pathogens in the water would have multiplied, increasing the percentage of contaminants in the bottle. It is unlikely that the water would become sweeter as a result of this process. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The students get the knowledge. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A teacher makes a presentation. (B) The teacher asked them to draw isobars under given information.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A teacher makes a presentation.\n\nExplanation: A teacher making a presentation is a more plausible cause for students gaining knowledge as it involves the teacher imparting information and explaining concepts to the students. On the other hand, asking students to draw isobars under given information may help them understand a specific concept, but it may not necessarily lead to overall knowledge gain. A presentation, on the other hand, can cover a wide range of topics and provide a comprehensive understanding of a subject."}}
{"Q": "Silver can transfer energy very efficiently. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bought an amethyst. (B) Silver has the strongest electrical conductivity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Silver has the strongest electrical conductivity.\nExplanation: Silver is known for its high electrical conductivity, which means it can easily transfer energy in the form of electricity. This is due to the way its atoms are arranged, which allows for the easy movement of electrons. As a result, silver is often used in electrical wiring, circuitry, and other applications where efficient energy transfer is important. While amethyst is a type of quartz crystal that is believed to have healing properties, it is not directly related to the efficient energy transfer of silver."}}
{"Q": "It has good ability to strech. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This machine is designed to use X-rays to look inside an object. (B) This string has strong elasticity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This string has strong elasticity.\nExplanation: The ability to stretch is a characteristic of elasticity, which is the ability of a material to return to its original shape after being stretched or deformed. Therefore, it is more plausible that the string has strong elasticity, rather than a machine designed to use X-rays to look inside an object, which is unrelated to the ability to stretch."}}
{"Q": "Jack lives in the southeastern United States. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He's been seeing hummingbirds around his house lately. (B) He is likely to see cottonmouths around.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He's been seeing hummingbirds around his house lately.\nExplanation: The southeastern United States is known for its warm and humid climate, which is ideal for hummingbirds. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack would see hummingbirds around his house rather than cottonmouths, which are venomous snakes that typically live near bodies of water."}}
{"Q": "Mario's uncle murdered an old lady. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was doomed to be sent into a prison. (B) He died soon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was doomed to be sent into a prison.\nExplanation: Murder is a serious crime and is punishable by law. Mario's uncle committed a heinous act by murdering an old lady, and as a result, he would be arrested, charged, and sentenced to prison for his crime. It is unlikely that he would die soon unless there were extenuating circumstances, such as illness or injury. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A series of pictures were added to explain those differences. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I cut all buds of the twig. (B) There are some differences between this two methods.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The addition of pictures to explain the differences suggests that there are indeed differences between the two methods being compared. Option A, which suggests that all buds were cut off the twig, does not explain why pictures were added to the explanation. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "We always saw amphibians asleep. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We came to the boundary of the wildlife habitat. (B) Winter is a proper season for amphibians.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Amphibians are ectothermic, meaning their body temperature is regulated by the environment around them. During the winter, temperatures drop and many amphibians enter a state of hibernation or torpor to conserve energy and survive the cold. This is why we often see them asleep or inactive during the winter months. Option A is not a plausible answer as the boundary of a wildlife habitat would not necessarily cause amphibians to fall asleep."}}
{"Q": "Jorge caught Mumps before his marriage. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jorge had a son after his marriage with his wife. (B) George and his wife have't had  children for a long time since their marriage.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Mumps is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the salivary glands, leading to swelling and pain in the face. In some cases, it can also affect the testicles in males, leading to infertility. If Jorge had mumps before his marriage and it affected his testicles, it could have resulted in reduced fertility or infertility, making it difficult for him and his wife to have children. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not necessarily related to Jorge's mumps infection and is not a direct consequence of the infection."}}
{"Q": "Jerry lying beside the bay needs some water to wash his feet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He walked to the bay. (B) He ran to the bathroom to take a bath under his father's permission.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He walked to the bay.\nExplanation: Since Jerry is already lying beside the bay, it is more plausible that he would simply walk to the bay to get some water to wash his feet. Running to the bathroom to take a bath under his father's permission seems like an unnecessary and unrelated action to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Ladybugs can not live in cold environment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They appear in summer and autumn. (B) They appear in winter and spring.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) They appear in summer and autumn.\nExplanation: Ladybugs are cold-blooded insects and cannot survive in extremely cold temperatures. As a result, they tend to appear in warmer seasons such as summer and autumn when the temperature is suitable for their survival. In winter and spring, they may hibernate or seek shelter in warm places to survive. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The researcher discovered it's undergoing the mitosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The scientist has found spermatocytes in the rabbit. (B) The researcher put some Spirogyras under the microscope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The process of mitosis is a characteristic of eukaryotic cells, which undergo cell division to produce two identical daughter cells. Spirogyras are a type of green algae that have eukaryotic cells and undergo mitosis during their life cycle. Therefore, it is more plausible that the researcher observed mitosis in Spirogyras under the microscope rather than finding spermatocytes in a rabbit, which would not necessarily indicate mitosis."}}
{"Q": "Tom abuses drug. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has dependence on drug. (B) A lot of problems arise.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. A lot of problems arise.\nExplanation: When someone abuses drugs, it can lead to a variety of problems such as health issues, financial difficulties, strained relationships, legal troubles, and more. While dependence on drugs may also occur, it is not the only outcome of drug abuse. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it encompasses the range of potential consequences that can arise from drug abuse."}}
{"Q": "He went to the vet to buy medicine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The serval is tired. (B) Tom's sheep always have diarrhea.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom's sheep always have diarrhea.\nExplanation: The sentence does not mention anything about a serval being tired, but it does mention someone going to the vet to buy medicine. The most plausible reason for this would be that Tom's sheep always have diarrhea, which would require medication to treat."}}
{"Q": "It is a buck. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The hunter saw a buck near his hut. (B) This deer has  large flattened shovel-shaped antlers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This deer has large flattened shovel-shaped antlers.\nExplanation: The statement \"It is a buck\" refers to the male deer, which is known for having antlers. The mention of the antlers being \"large flattened shovel-shaped\" further confirms that it is a buck. The statement does not provide any information about a hunter or a hut, so option (A) is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom took away the Prisms in the binoculars. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The binoculars cannot bend the light. (B) Since then, Tom loves to wear sunglasses.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The binoculars cannot bend the light.\nExplanation: Prisms are responsible for bending and refracting light in binoculars. Without prisms, the binoculars cannot bend the light, resulting in a blurry and distorted image. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not related to the removal of prisms from binoculars."}}
{"Q": "She bought a new kind of honey. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She preferred the viscosity of the old honey. (B) She made some hennas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She preferred the viscosity of the old honey.\nExplanation: Since the question mentions that she bought a new kind of honey, it is more likely that she tried it and compared it to the old honey she used to buy. The fact that the question only mentions the new honey and not henna suggests that the answer is related to the honey itself. Therefore, it is more plausible that she preferred the viscosity (thickness) of the old honey over the new one."}}
{"Q": "The doctor gave him some medicine involving codeine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His condition of tussis askes for centrally applied medicine. (B) The patient can't stop coughing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The patient can't stop coughing.\n\nExplanation: Codeine is a type of opioid medication that is often used as a cough suppressant. It works by reducing the activity in the part of the brain that triggers coughing. Therefore, if the patient is experiencing persistent coughing, the doctor may prescribe codeine to help alleviate the symptoms. Option A is not a plausible answer as it uses medical jargon and is not easily understandable."}}
{"Q": "The smooth becomes smooth. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The stone was erosed. (B) ADIS's doctor says ADIS's brain always unabated thinking.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The smooth becoming smooth suggests that there was a change in the surface of the stone, which is likely due to erosion. ADIS's doctor's statement about their brain has no relevance to the physical properties of the stone."}}
{"Q": "The wrapping materials were degraded. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The vegetation was destroyed. (B) Prominent reduction of their pollution was achieved.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The vegetation was destroyed.\nExplanation: If the wrapping materials were degraded, it means that they broke down or decomposed. If these materials were left in the environment, they could have released harmful chemicals or microplastics that could have harmed the vegetation. Additionally, if the wrapping materials were used to wrap plants or trees, the degradation could have caused the plants to suffocate or be unable to receive the necessary nutrients, leading to their destruction. Therefore, it is more plausible that the degradation of wrapping materials would result in the destruction of vegetation rather than a reduction in pollution."}}
{"Q": "Salmon is found highest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A mongoose and a venomous snake are placed in one big box. (B) They tested the fatty acids in a variety of fish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The cause of salmon being found highest could be due to the fact that researchers tested the fatty acids in a variety of fish and found that salmon had the highest levels. This is a more plausible answer compared to (A) which is unrelated to the topic of fish and fatty acids."}}
{"Q": "Many caterpillars pupate here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It is in the lovely season. (B) There are many cocoons spuns in leaf litter on the ground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The presence of many cocoons spun in leaf litter on the ground suggests that this is a suitable habitat for caterpillars to pupate. The leaf litter provides a protective layer and insulation for the cocoons, and the abundance of caterpillars in the area may indicate that there is a good food source for them. The lovely season (choice A) may be a contributing factor, but it is not a direct cause of the caterpillars pupating in this location."}}
{"Q": "He suffered from depression. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has been very anxious about work recently. (B) The psychopath ate too much Neuroleptics.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Anxiety about work can lead to stress and ultimately depression. It is a common cause of depression in many individuals. On the other hand, the consumption of too much Neuroleptics (a type of medication used to treat mental illnesses) can cause side effects such as drowsiness, confusion, and movement disorders, but it is not a common cause of depression. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There is no food in the village. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) All the villagers went on strike. (B) Human must be here for their food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Human must be here for their food.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the villagers would have to find alternative sources of food or leave the village to find food elsewhere, rather than going on strike. The statement \"Human must be here for their food\" suggests that the villagers are dependent on the availability of food in their immediate surroundings."}}
{"Q": "The driver wore a pair of sungalsses. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His entire external ears is enclosed in a rigid cups. (B) His eyes can adapt to bright conditions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His eyes can adapt to bright conditions.\nExplanation: Sunglasses are designed to protect the eyes from bright sunlight and harmful UV rays. By wearing sunglasses, the driver's eyes can adapt to bright conditions without being strained or damaged by the sun's glare. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as sunglasses do not enclose the external ears in rigid cups."}}
{"Q": "The scientist studies cloning. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She knows much about the process of producing clones. (B) The machines can still work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She knows much about the process of producing clones.\nExplanation: Since the scientist studies cloning, it is likely that she has gained knowledge and expertise in the process of producing clones. This answer is more plausible than option B, which is unrelated to the study of cloning."}}
{"Q": "She is the witness of the homicide. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lily is pregnant. (B) Jane saw the driver killed by others.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jane saw the driver killed by others.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the homicide and provides a reason for why Jane is a witness. Option (A) about Lily being pregnant does not seem to have any relevance to the homicide."}}
{"Q": "Buttermilk was my allergen. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I suffered from a nerve injury. (B) I had allergic reactions to a number of dairy drinks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I had allergic reactions to a number of dairy drinks.\nExplanation: Buttermilk is a dairy drink, and if someone is allergic to dairy, they may experience allergic reactions after consuming it. It is unlikely that a nerve injury would cause an allergic reaction to buttermilk. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The government can't take use of the universal method. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are not too many people in this village. (B) My father is an evolutionist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement about the government not being able to use the universal method is not related to the father being an evolutionist. Option A, which states that there are not too many people in the village, is a more plausible answer as the universal method may require a larger population or sample size to be effective."}}
{"Q": "Tom put some yeast when baking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He made delicious bread. (B) They hardened.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He made delicious bread.\nExplanation: Yeast is a key ingredient in bread-making as it helps the dough rise and gives the bread its fluffy texture. When yeast is added to bread dough, it ferments the sugars in the dough, producing carbon dioxide gas which causes the dough to rise. As a result, the bread becomes light and airy, with a delicious flavor and aroma. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom made delicious bread by adding yeast to his recipe."}}
{"Q": "The production of mineral extraction processing has been drastically reduced. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a shortage of raw materials for tailings processing plants. (B) Plant production has expanded.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There is a shortage of raw materials for tailings processing plants.\nExplanation: If the production of mineral extraction processing has been drastically reduced, it means that there is less material being extracted from the mines. This would result in a shortage of raw materials for tailings processing plants, which rely on the extracted minerals to operate. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B, stating that plant production has expanded, is unlikely as it contradicts the initial statement that production has been reduced."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought a lot marijuana by coincidence. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He kept it for its high potential. (B) Tom was banned from smoking by his wife.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom would keep the marijuana for its high potential rather than being banned from smoking by his wife. If he bought it by coincidence, he may have been curious to try it or may have seen an opportunity to sell it for profit. It is unlikely that his wife would ban him from smoking without knowing the circumstances of how he obtained it."}}
{"Q": "Tom read the manual carefully. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom needed to do operation. (B) He found many pictures.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom needed to do operation.\nExplanation: Reading the manual carefully would have given Tom a better understanding of how to operate whatever the manual was for. Therefore, it is more plausible that as a result of reading the manual carefully, Tom needed to do an operation. Option B, that he found many pictures, may be a possible outcome, but it is less likely to be the main result of reading the manual carefully."}}
{"Q": "He was sentenced to prison. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He surprisingly found that prisoners could read in the reading room and learn about the outside world through TV. (B) He was electrocuted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person would discover new things about prison life, such as the reading room and TV, rather than being electrocuted as a result of their sentence."}}
{"Q": "I planted watermelon in my garden. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The peacock in the distance rushed to save it immediately. (B) I used pesticides to them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the person used pesticides to protect the watermelon from pests or diseases, rather than a peacock rushing to save it. Using pesticides is a common practice in gardening to ensure the health and growth of plants."}}
{"Q": "The process of converting from analog equipment to digital occurs in our daily life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We are in the age of digitalization. (B) Tom needs an umbrella.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The cause of the process of converting from analog equipment to digital is the age of digitalization. With the advancement of technology, digital equipment has become more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective compared to analog equipment. Therefore, many industries and individuals have switched to digital equipment to improve their productivity and performance. This trend is expected to continue as technology continues to evolve."}}
{"Q": "Tom's turnover and cost are equal this month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has gained a lot of profits. (B) Tom's profit is 0 this month.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom's profit is 0 this month.\nExplanation: If Tom's turnover and cost are equal, it means that he did not make any profit this month. Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost from the turnover, so if they are equal, the profit is zero. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Caterpillars are not as pretty as butterflies. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The clouds are very thick in the sky. (B) Caterpillars are not colorful.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Caterpillars are not colorful.\nExplanation: Caterpillars are not as pretty as butterflies because they lack the bright and vibrant colors that butterflies have. Caterpillars are usually brown or green in color, which helps them blend in with their surroundings and avoid predators. As they transform into butterflies, they develop colorful wings that help them attract mates and deter predators. Therefore, the lack of color in caterpillars is the more plausible cause for their less attractive appearance compared to butterflies."}}
{"Q": "He became mature. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob's mentality has changed a lot recently. (B) He watched the growth stages of podetium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Bob's mentality has changed a lot recently.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the cause of Bob's maturity is related to a change in his mentality. Watching the growth stages of podetium, as mentioned in option B, is unlikely to have a significant impact on Bob's personal growth and maturity. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mike should take scientific facts into consideration. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike is an economist. (B) Mike was asked to create a new template.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mike is an economist.\nExplanation: As an economist, Mike may not have a background in science and may not be accustomed to considering scientific facts in his work. Therefore, it is important for him to take scientific facts into consideration to ensure that his work is accurate and reliable."}}
{"Q": "The service staff of this hotel lack management. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The service quality of the hotel has seriously declined. (B) In addition to financial management courses, she also studied economic law and tax law.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The service quality of the hotel has seriously declined.\nExplanation: If the service staff of a hotel lack management, it is likely that they will not be properly trained, supervised, or motivated, which can lead to a decline in the quality of service provided to guests. This can result in negative reviews, decreased customer satisfaction, and ultimately, a loss of business for the hotel. On the other hand, option B is unrelated to the given statement and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Jerry doesn't want to hiccup. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The only way is not to breathe. (B) The only way is not to shout.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The only way is not to breathe.\nExplanation: Hiccups are caused by a sudden contraction of the diaphragm muscle, which can be triggered by a variety of factors such as eating too quickly, drinking carbonated beverages, or even emotional stress. Holding one's breath is a common method to try and stop hiccups, as it can help to reset the breathing pattern and relax the diaphragm muscle. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jerry would try to stop hiccuping by holding his breath rather than not shouting, which is not necessarily related to the cause or treatment of hiccups."}}
{"Q": "The garden bloomed with roses. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It felt at ease. (B) He found that different rose leaves had different shapes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It felt at ease.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the garden was filled with roses in bloom, which is a beautiful sight and can create a peaceful and calming atmosphere. Therefore, it is more plausible that the garden felt at ease rather than someone discovering the different shapes of rose leaves."}}
{"Q": "They receive government benefits every month. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They are poor and can't work. (B) Otters move into a new habitat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They are poor and can't work.\nExplanation: The most likely reason for someone to receive government benefits every month is that they are unable to support themselves financially. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as being disabled, elderly, or experiencing financial hardship. Otters moving into a new habitat is not a plausible explanation for someone receiving government benefits."}}
{"Q": "Tom keeps a poodle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He fed them with grass. (B) His monthly expenses soars.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. His monthly expenses soars.\nExplanation: Keeping a poodle requires regular grooming, veterinary check-ups, and high-quality food, which can be expensive. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's monthly expenses would increase rather than him feeding the poodle with grass, which is not a suitable diet for dogs."}}
{"Q": "Tom has compacted the plant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He reported that he had successfully extracted lysosomes. (B) Tom has calculate the density of the plants in a wrong way.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom has calculated the density of the plants in a wrong way.\nExplanation: Compacting the plant would not result in the successful extraction of lysosomes. However, it could affect the density of the plant material, which could lead to incorrect calculations if Tom was trying to determine the density of the plants. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The cancer cells died because they lost the ability to multiple. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor adopted radiotherapy to treat his cancer. (B) The particles that make up the material collide with each other.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The doctor adopted radiotherapy to treat his cancer. Radiotherapy is a treatment that uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells by damaging their DNA. This damage can prevent the cancer cells from multiplying and eventually lead to their death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cancer cells lost the ability to multiply due to the radiotherapy treatment. Option B, which refers to the collision of particles, is not related to the cause of cancer cell death."}}
{"Q": "He wasn't thrown from the bus in the  car accident. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He fastened seatbelts when getting on the bus. (B) He unlocked seatbelts when getting on the bus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He fastened seatbelts when getting on the bus.\nExplanation: If he had fastened his seatbelt when getting on the bus, he would have been secured in his seat during the car accident and not thrown from the bus. On the other hand, if he had unlocked his seatbelt when getting on the bus, he would not have been wearing it during the accident and would have been thrown from the bus. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Technology has been advanced. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The telecommunting is convenient. (B) The electronic devices human use become more abundant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Both (A) and (B) are plausible answers.\n\nExplanation: With the advancement of technology, telecommuting has become more convenient as people can work from anywhere with an internet connection. Additionally, electronic devices have become more abundant and accessible to people, making communication and access to information easier. Therefore, both options are plausible outcomes of technological advancement."}}
{"Q": "He was sent to the hospital for treatment soon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The president recently felt worse. (B) Tom had a lung infection.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom had a lung infection.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"he\" was sent to the hospital for treatment soon, but it does not specify who \"he\" is. However, the previous sentence mentions Tom, so it is likely that he is the one being referred to. The cause of his hospitalization is given as \"treatment,\" which suggests that he was ill or injured. Option A, which suggests that the president's health was the cause, is not supported by the sentence and is therefore less plausible. Option B, on the other hand, is a likely explanation given that lung infections can be serious and require medical attention."}}
{"Q": "Jack ate rotten fruit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack has a stomach bug. (B) Jack became malnourished and was losing weight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jack has a stomach bug.\nExplanation: Eating rotten fruit can lead to food poisoning, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. These symptoms are commonly referred to as a stomach bug. Malnutrition and weight loss are not immediate consequences of eating rotten fruit, but rather long-term effects of a poor diet. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The farm brings in artificial pollination researchers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The farm is worried about the decrease in the number of bees this year. (B) The farm is worried about the decrease in the number of flowers this year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The farm is worried about the decrease in the number of bees this year.\n\nExplanation: Artificial pollination is often used as a solution when there is a decrease in the number of natural pollinators, such as bees. Therefore, it is more plausible that the farm brought in artificial pollination researchers because they were concerned about the decrease in the number of bees, rather than the decrease in the number of flowers."}}
{"Q": "The starving tayra ate lots of fruits. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a starving tayra. (B) All the refugees had was food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that there is a starving tayra, which implies that the cause of the tayra eating lots of fruits is due to its hunger and lack of other food sources. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the given sentence and is not a logical explanation for the tayra's behavior."}}
{"Q": "My mom as a midwife was respected by others. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My mom is a queen. (B) Women's health care providers with advanced educations deserves respect.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Women's health care providers with advanced educations deserve respect because they have the knowledge and skills to provide quality care to their patients. As a midwife, my mom would have undergone extensive training and education to be able to provide safe and effective care to women during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. This expertise would have earned her the respect of her colleagues and patients. The idea that my mom is a queen is not a plausible explanation for why she was respected as a midwife."}}
{"Q": "He hunts deer for a living. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Thomas is an Indian. (B) Tom is a guide.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom is a guide.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom is a guide who takes people on hunting trips and earns a living from it, rather than being an Indian who solely relies on hunting deer for survival. Being a guide is a common profession in areas where hunting is popular, and it is a more likely explanation for someone hunting deer for a living."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have crossed grapes with other species. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists planted grapes in another place. (B) Scientists have bred a new type of crop with grapes and resistant species.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Scientists have bred a new type of crop with grapes and resistant species.\nExplanation: Scientists have crossed grapes with other species to create new varieties of grapes that are resistant to diseases and pests. This is done through selective breeding, where the desirable traits of one species are combined with the desirable traits of another species to create a new hybrid variety. This process can take many years and involves careful selection and testing of the resulting hybrids to ensure that they have the desired characteristics. The goal of this process is to create new grape varieties that are more resilient and can produce higher yields, which can help to improve the sustainability and profitability of grape farming."}}
{"Q": "These bodies in the universe are large enough to be detectable by telescope. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Astronomical spectrometers provide eye protection. (B) They are called as Asteroids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They are called as Asteroids.\nExplanation: When bodies in the universe are large enough to be detectable by telescope, they are typically referred to as asteroids. This is because asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the sun and are often visible from Earth. Astronomical spectrometers, on the other hand, are instruments used to measure the properties of light emitted by celestial objects, and have no direct relation to the detection of large bodies in the universe. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Many domestic cats lack the ability of adaptation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are ill-adapted. (B) They can't live well in a strange environment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They can't live well in a strange environment.\nExplanation: Domestic cats have been bred for thousands of years to live in human homes and environments, which means they may not have the same level of adaptability as their wild counterparts. This can make it difficult for them to adjust to new environments, such as when they are taken to a new home or left in a boarding facility. While they may not be ill-adapted in their natural environment, they may struggle to thrive in unfamiliar surroundings. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lisa goes to hospital to inject salt water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lisa lacks calcium in her body. (B) Lisa lacks water in her body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lisa lacks water in her body.\n\nExplanation: If Lisa lacks calcium in her body, she would need to take calcium supplements or consume calcium-rich foods. Injecting salt water would not address this issue. On the other hand, if Lisa lacks water in her body, she may be dehydrated and need to replenish her fluids. Injecting salt water can help to restore the balance of electrolytes in her body and rehydrate her. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Cathy put on some lotion today. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She began to lose her weight. (B) Cathy's skin looked beautiful.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Cathy's skin looked beautiful.\nExplanation: Applying lotion is known to moisturize and nourish the skin, making it look healthier and more radiant. It does not have any effect on weight loss, so option A is not a plausible answer. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome of Cathy putting on lotion."}}
{"Q": "He was diagnosed with heart diseases. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom injured his head in the car accident. (B) The president recently felt worse.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of heart disease is not related to head injury, but it can be caused by various factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the president's health condition may have contributed to his heart disease diagnosis."}}
{"Q": "During the Republican period, warlords strictly controlled public opinion. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He gained mental awareness. (B) Intellectuals hid in Peking University's library to debate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: During the Republican period, warlords strictly controlled public opinion, leading to a lack of freedom of speech and expression. Intellectuals who wanted to debate and discuss ideas had to hide in places like Peking University's library to avoid persecution. This was a common practice during the time, and many important discussions and debates took place in secret to avoid the wrath of the warlords. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He can't get close to pyrethrum. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Logan is allergic to chrysanthemum. (B) He has something wrong with his muscles controlling the diaphragm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Logan is allergic to chrysanthemum.\n\nExplanation: Pyrethrum is a natural insecticide derived from chrysanthemum flowers. If Logan is allergic to chrysanthemum, he may experience symptoms such as itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing when he comes into contact with pyrethrum. This would make it difficult for him to get close to the substance. On the other hand, there is no clear connection between muscle control and pyrethrum exposure, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "He checked his intestinnal cell. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wanted to uproot this disease from the pathogenesis. (B) He wanted to know the details of his illness.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Checking his intestinal cells suggests that the person is likely trying to identify the root cause of a disease or illness. By examining the cells, he may be able to determine if there are any abnormalities or signs of disease that can be targeted for treatment. This aligns with choice (A), which suggests that the person is trying to uproot the disease from its source. Choice (B) is less likely, as simply knowing the details of the illness would not necessarily require examining intestinal cells specifically."}}
{"Q": "They replaced the city's streetlights with ones that run on photovoltaic cells. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The carbon dioxide, one of the major greenhouse gases, content in the air decreases. (B) These lights turn on automatically when the sun's rays disappear.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The carbon dioxide, one of the major greenhouse gases, content in the air decreases.\nExplanation: Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electricity, which means that the streetlights no longer rely on electricity generated from fossil fuels. This reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, which is a major greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Therefore, replacing the city's streetlights with ones that run on photovoltaic cells can help to decrease the carbon dioxide content in the air. Option B is not a plausible answer as it describes a common feature of many streetlights, regardless of their power source."}}
{"Q": "Tonight's homework is to draw an angel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mother explained to him patiently using the picture book at home. (B) Tom draws wings first.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom would start drawing the wings first when asked to draw an angel, as wings are a common and recognizable feature of angels. It is less likely that his mother would need to explain how to draw an angel using a picture book, as the concept of an angel is widely known and understood."}}
{"Q": "There is no stick between these two carbon atoms. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) These two carbon atoms do not affect each other. (B) There is no bond between these two carbon atoms.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. There is no bond between these two carbon atoms.\n\nExplanation: In organic chemistry, a bond between two carbon atoms is typically formed by sharing a pair of electrons between them. If there is no stick (i.e. bond) between two carbon atoms, it means that they are not sharing any electrons and therefore not bonded to each other. This can have significant implications for the properties and reactivity of the molecule in which these carbon atoms are located."}}
{"Q": "She can't digest well. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mom gave her some maltose. (B) She has some yogurt after dinner.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She has some yogurt after dinner.\nExplanation: Yogurt contains probiotics, which can help improve digestion by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Maltose, on the other hand, is a type of sugar that may actually worsen digestive issues for some people. Therefore, it is more plausible that having yogurt after dinner would be a helpful solution for someone who struggles with digestion."}}
{"Q": "Lucy falied in her experiment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She found there was some trouble with the sources of data. (B) She found the volume of the liquid decreased.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Lucy failed in her experiment, it is more likely that she found there was some trouble with the sources of data rather than the volume of the liquid decreasing. Failing an experiment usually means that the expected results were not obtained, which could be due to various reasons such as errors in the methodology, equipment malfunction, or inaccurate data. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is not in good health and is always ill. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has lots of pimples on his face. (B) He is much better after taking health products.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He is much better after taking health products.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's health improved after taking health products rather than developing pimples on his face due to his illness. Pimples are not a common symptom of poor health, whereas taking health products can help improve one's overall well-being."}}
{"Q": "The instruction of the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the city required the closure of public places. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The libraries in the city were closed according to the instruction. (B) Most f them were diagnosed with the sarcoidosis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The libraries in the city were closed according to the instruction.\nExplanation: The instruction of the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the city required the closure of public places, which includes libraries. Therefore, it is plausible that the libraries in the city were closed according to the instruction. Option B, on the other hand, is not related to the closure of public places and is not a likely outcome of the instruction."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a tumour in his stomach. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mom bought sundews for him. (B) He found an oncologist to treat him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He found an oncologist to treat him.\nExplanation: A tumour in the stomach is a serious medical condition that requires medical attention. The most plausible outcome would be that Tom sought out medical treatment, such as finding an oncologist to help him manage and treat the tumour. While his mom may have bought sundews for him as a supportive measure, it is unlikely to be the primary solution for treating a tumour."}}
{"Q": "He was in a bad mood and cried every day. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This boy fell into a sad situation because he had a quarrel with his classmates. (B) He has been emotionally unstable recently.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He has been emotionally unstable recently.\nExplanation: The fact that he is crying every day suggests that his emotional state is not stable. It is possible that there may have been a specific incident that triggered his emotional instability, but without more information, it is difficult to determine if it was a quarrel with his classmates or something else entirely. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it acknowledges the emotional instability without making assumptions about the cause."}}
{"Q": "Little Henry always goes to the intertidal zone to pick up seafood to eat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chitons can always be seen on the dining table in their home. (B) He needs dialysis every week.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Little Henry's habit of picking up seafood from the intertidal zone can lead to him consuming contaminated seafood, which can cause various health problems, including kidney damage. Dialysis is a treatment for kidney failure, which suggests that Little Henry's habit has caused him to develop kidney problems. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not a likely outcome of Little Henry's habit and seems unrelated to the given information."}}
{"Q": "Cannabis has destroyed some families. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are people suffering from social drugs. (B) The fertility became lower.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There are people suffering from social drugs.\nExplanation: Cannabis, like any other drug, can have negative effects on individuals and families. It can lead to addiction, financial problems, and strained relationships. Some people may prioritize their drug use over their responsibilities and relationships, leading to the breakdown of their family. This can cause emotional pain and suffering for everyone involved. Therefore, it is important to educate people about the potential risks of drug use and provide support for those who are struggling with addiction."}}
{"Q": "He got kidney stones. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can take some medicine to force kidney stones to come out through ureters. (B) They burst when the internal and external pressures are different.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: When someone gets kidney stones, they can take medication to help the stones pass through the ureters and out of the body. This is a common treatment for kidney stones and is much less dangerous than the stones bursting. Option B is not a plausible answer as kidney stones do not burst when the internal and external pressures are different."}}
{"Q": "We should plant pistachios here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This area has serious flood problem. (B) Only the strong plants that was native to the desert environments can survive here.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that only strong plants native to desert environments can survive in this area. Pistachios are a type of tree that is well adapted to desert environments, making them a suitable choice for planting in this area. The flood problem mentioned in choice A is not relevant to the decision to plant pistachios."}}
{"Q": "Tom put the seeds in the greenhouse. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The seeds died. (B) The seeds germinated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The seeds germinated.\nExplanation: Putting seeds in a greenhouse provides them with a controlled environment that is conducive to germination. The greenhouse provides warmth, moisture, and protection from pests and harsh weather conditions, which are all essential for the seeds to sprout and grow. Therefore, it is more plausible that the seeds germinated rather than died."}}
{"Q": "I plant gourds and squash. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There is a lot of germs hiding. (B) There is something in commen between them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. There is something in common between them.\nExplanation: Gourds and squash are both members of the Cucurbitaceae family, which means they share many similarities in terms of growth habits, soil requirements, and pest and disease issues. Therefore, it is likely that planting both gourds and squash together would result in similar growing conditions and challenges. There is no evidence to suggest that planting these crops would result in an increase in germs hiding in the soil."}}
{"Q": "There was a swamp in the village. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The villagers found it became stagnant water after several years. (B) The villagers were stuck in the swamp.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The villagers found it became stagnant water after several years.\nExplanation: Swamps are typically areas of standing water, and over time, the water can become stagnant due to a lack of movement or circulation. This can lead to a buildup of bacteria and other harmful organisms, making the water unsafe for drinking or other uses. Therefore, it is more plausible that the villagers would find the swamp had become stagnant water after several years rather than being stuck in it."}}
{"Q": "Since entering this profession, Tom has always reminded himself to keep his head clear. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Five years later, Tom become the CEO of a listed company. (B) He was always invited to meetings and gave perfect presentations.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was always invited to meetings and gave perfect presentations.\nExplanation: By keeping his head clear, Tom was able to maintain focus and clarity in his work. This likely led to him being seen as a reliable and competent professional, which in turn resulted in him being invited to important meetings and giving successful presentations. While becoming a CEO is certainly a possibility, it is less likely to be a direct result of simply keeping one's head clear."}}
{"Q": "An eclipse is going to occur in one hour. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists call for planting trees. (B) Numerous of viewers have gathered on the playground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Numerous viewers have gathered on the playground.\nExplanation: An eclipse is a rare and exciting event that many people would want to witness. Therefore, it is more plausible that people would gather to watch the eclipse rather than scientists calling for planting trees, which is not directly related to the event."}}
{"Q": "Artificial ecosystems are ecosystems that have been formed after human intervention and modification. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Microbes provide the fundamental underpinning in artificial ecosystems. (B) I found a list of recommended books on this topic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Microbes provide the fundamental underpinning in artificial ecosystems.\nExplanation: When humans intervene and modify an ecosystem, it can disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem. However, microbes are able to adapt and thrive in these altered environments, providing a foundation for the ecosystem to rebuild and function. They play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, decomposition, and other important processes that support the ecosystem. Therefore, it is plausible that microbes provide the fundamental underpinning in artificial ecosystems."}}
{"Q": "She is a very good interpreter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She saw tuatara in New Zealand. (B) Lucy will accumulate a lot in peacetime.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: It is not clear from the given choices what the cause of her being a good interpreter is. Therefore, a more plausible answer cannot be provided."}}
{"Q": "He established his own company ten years ago and runs it successfully. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The company is famous around the world. (B) He is a great entrepreneur.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He is a great entrepreneur.\nExplanation: The fact that he established his own company ten years ago and runs it successfully indicates that he has the skills and abilities to be a successful entrepreneur. This does not necessarily mean that the company is famous around the world, as there are many successful companies that are not well-known globally. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom had Shigellosis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His father has a cerebral thrombosis now. (B) Only his feces could transmit the disease to others.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Only his feces could transmit the disease to others.\n\nExplanation: Shigellosis is a bacterial infection that affects the digestive system and is typically spread through contaminated food or water, or through contact with infected feces. It is unlikely that Tom's father would develop a cerebral thrombosis as a direct result of Tom's shigellosis. However, it is important to note that proper hygiene and sanitation practices should be followed to prevent the spread of the disease through fecal-oral transmission."}}
{"Q": "The general had excellent exertions in the war. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The enemies were strongly influenced. (B) He was strong enough to cope with dangers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was strong enough to cope with dangers.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the general performed well in the war, indicating that he had the necessary skills and abilities to handle the challenges and dangers of the battlefield. Therefore, it is more plausible that he became stronger and better equipped to cope with the dangers of war rather than the enemies being influenced by his exertions."}}
{"Q": "The breeder feeds pelicans a lot of food every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Pelicans is very healthy. (B) He feeds all kinds of animals three meals a day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Since the breeder feeds pelicans a lot of food every day, it is more likely that the pelicans are very healthy. Overfeeding can lead to health problems, but assuming the breeder is providing a balanced diet, the pelicans would benefit from the extra food. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the given information about the pelicans' diet."}}
{"Q": "He thought about the framework quickly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has to type an essay. (B) Tom proposed a new idea.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom proposed a new idea.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tom's quick thinking about the framework was due to him proposing a new idea, as this would require him to think creatively and quickly in order to present his idea effectively. Typing an essay, on the other hand, may require some planning and organization, but it is not necessarily a task that would require quick thinking about a framework."}}
{"Q": "The mouth of the cicadas was removed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The tetrapod can't ea now. (B) It couldn't suck sap anymore.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It couldn't suck sap anymore.\n\nExplanation: Cicadas use their mouthparts to suck sap from plants. If their mouthparts were removed, they would not be able to feed on sap anymore. This would likely lead to their death, as they would not be able to obtain the nutrients they need to survive. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) is not correct because the question is specifically about the cicadas, not a tetrapod."}}
{"Q": "Their research is mainly carried out in eukaryotes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They need to study enhancer regions that control gene expression in organisms. (B) Many people tested their amount of urine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Eukaryotes have more complex gene regulation mechanisms, including enhancer regions that control gene expression. Therefore, studying eukaryotes allows researchers to better understand these mechanisms and how they contribute to gene expression and regulation. Additionally, eukaryotes are more similar to humans in terms of gene regulation and cellular processes, making them a more relevant model for studying human biology and disease."}}
{"Q": "The hospital hold many patients with parastic. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Most delusions of the patients are caused by amebiasis. (B) Most death of the patients are caused by amebiasis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Most death of the patients are caused by amebiasis.\nExplanation: Parasitic infections can cause a range of symptoms and complications, including death. Amebiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica, which can cause severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and liver abscesses. If left untreated, amebiasis can lead to death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the hospital's patients with parasitic infections are experiencing a higher rate of death due to amebiasis rather than delusions."}}
{"Q": "Eventually he found that it present on the ventrolateral surfaces of vertebral body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was looking for the location of osteophytes. (B) The biologist observed the epidermis under a microscope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was looking for the location of osteophytes.\nExplanation: Osteophytes are bony outgrowths that can develop on the ventrolateral surfaces of vertebral bodies, which can cause pain and discomfort. Therefore, it is plausible that the person was looking for the location of osteophytes in order to diagnose or treat a patient with back pain. On the other hand, observing the epidermis under a microscope is not related to the location of osteophytes on vertebral bodies."}}
{"Q": "Tom needs to compress liquids and gases every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom bacame overwight. (B) He prefers to compressing the gases.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom developed a preference for compressing gases rather than becoming overweight due to compressing liquids and gases. There is no direct correlation between compressing liquids and gases and weight gain. However, it is possible that Tom found compressing gases to be more efficient or easier than compressing liquids, leading to his preference."}}
{"Q": "He found a lot of layers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom cuts through epidermises. (B) The researcher analyzed the gaskets.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom cuts through epidermises.\nExplanation: The word \"layers\" suggests that Tom was cutting through something that had multiple layers. The term \"epidermises\" refers to the outermost layer of skin or tissue, which can have multiple layers. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom was cutting through epidermises to find multiple layers rather than a researcher analyzing gaskets."}}
{"Q": "The doctor thought she had hirsutism. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a woman with very little hair. (B) There was an excess terminal hair growth in a female with a male distribution pattern.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There was an excess terminal hair growth in a female with a male distribution pattern.\nExplanation: Hirsutism is a condition in which there is excessive hair growth in women in a male distribution pattern, such as on the face, chest, and back. This can be caused by hormonal imbalances, such as an excess of androgens (male hormones) or an insensitivity to female hormones. It can also be caused by certain medications or medical conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it describes the actual cause of hirsutism. Option A is not related to hirsutism."}}
{"Q": "John's favourite flower is the cyclamen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He made the wall in his house in different colors. (B) He travelled to the Mediterranean region from Spain to Iran to learn about the history of cyclamen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John would travel to the Mediterranean region to learn about the history of cyclamen, as it is a flower that is native to that region. Making the wall in his house in different colors does not seem to have any direct connection to his favourite flower."}}
{"Q": "The organic matter needs to be heated to provide the conditions for electron migration. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists wants to research exoskeletons. (B) Tom needs to test the decarboxylation of organic matter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom needs to test the decarboxylation of organic matter.\nExplanation: Decarboxylation is a chemical reaction that involves the removal of a carboxyl group from a molecule. This reaction is often used in organic chemistry to produce various compounds. To carry out decarboxylation, the organic matter needs to be heated to provide the necessary conditions for electron migration. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the process of decarboxylation. Option A, on the other hand, is not related to the given statement and seems irrelevant."}}
{"Q": "The light bounces off my mirror. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Reflection of light occurred on my mirror. (B) Absorption of light occurred on my mirror.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Reflection of light occurred on my mirror.\nExplanation: When light bounces off a surface, it is called reflection. In this case, the light bounced off the mirror, which means that reflection occurred. Absorption of light would mean that the light was absorbed by the mirror and did not bounce off, which is not what happened in this scenario. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There are many asteroids in the night sky. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These asteroids form a line. (B) They are visible from the distance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They are visible from the distance.\nExplanation: The presence of many asteroids in the night sky would make them visible to the naked eye from a distance. However, there is no reason to believe that they would form a line or any specific pattern."}}
{"Q": "This town made a new road last year. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The town's economy is muchu better now. (B) You should not touch its surface.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The fact that a new road was made does not necessarily mean that the town's economy improved. However, it is plausible that the surface of the new road is delicate and should not be touched. This is a common warning for newly paved roads to prevent damage and maintain their quality."}}
{"Q": "The doctor used leeches to remove excess blood. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rachel is calculating her ovulation period. (B) Leeches feed on blood.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Leeches have been used in medicine for centuries to remove excess blood from the body. They work by attaching themselves to the skin and sucking out blood, which can help to reduce swelling and inflammation. In this case, the doctor likely used leeches to remove excess blood from the patient's body in order to treat a medical condition such as high blood pressure or a blood disorder. Option A, which suggests that the doctor used leeches to help Rachel calculate her ovulation period, is not a plausible explanation as leeches have no role in this process."}}
{"Q": "Mary used cosmetics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She felt dry eyes. (B) Soon two hyacinths built their nests on it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She felt dry eyes.\nExplanation: Cosmetics can contain chemicals that may cause dryness or irritation to the eyes. This is a common side effect of using certain types of cosmetics, especially if they are not applied properly or if the person has sensitive skin. It is important to choose cosmetics that are suitable for your skin type and to follow proper application techniques to avoid any adverse effects. On the other hand, option B is not a plausible answer as it does not make sense for hyacinths to build nests on cosmetics."}}
{"Q": "Tom tried to find nettles in the garden. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom paied special attention to those white flowers. (B) Tom wants to draw a picture of nettles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom paid special attention to those white flowers.\nExplanation: Since nettles are often found near white flowers, it is likely that Tom was looking for these flowers in order to locate the nettles. Therefore, paying special attention to the white flowers would be a plausible result of Tom's search for nettles. Option B is less likely as it does not necessarily follow that Tom would want to draw a picture of nettles just because he was looking for them in the garden."}}
{"Q": "The battle triggers world war I. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The battle is a stimuli. (B) The marshal deems that subjective feelings will also affect the outcome of the war.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The battle is a stimuli.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the battle triggered World War I, which implies that it was a significant event that led to the outbreak of the war. Therefore, option A, which suggests that the battle was a stimuli, is a more plausible answer. It is widely accepted that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist on June 28, 1914, was the immediate cause of World War I. The event triggered a series of diplomatic and military actions that eventually led to the war. Therefore, the battle mentioned in the question could be referring to this event, which acted as a stimuli for the war."}}
{"Q": "There are some waterways. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many hippopotamus live there. (B) Many giraffes live there.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Many hippopotamus live there.\nExplanation: Hippopotamuses are semi-aquatic animals and require water bodies to live in. They are known to inhabit rivers, lakes, and swamps. Therefore, it is more plausible that the presence of waterways would result in the presence of hippopotamuses rather than giraffes, which are land animals and do not require water bodies to survive."}}
{"Q": "This bag containing special plastic materials was given to scientists. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) All the bad stuff in it was removed. (B) The materials were identified.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The materials were identified.\nExplanation: Given that the bag contained special plastic materials, it is more plausible that scientists would identify the materials rather than removing all the bad stuff in it. Identifying the materials would allow scientists to study their properties and potential uses, while removing the bad stuff would not necessarily provide any useful information."}}
{"Q": "Their village takes the responsibility to take care of them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are many polyps living in this area. (B) The old couple are abondoned by their only son.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The old couple are abandoned by their only son.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is a common scenario in many cultures where the responsibility of taking care of elderly parents falls on the children. If the only son has abandoned the old couple, it is likely that the village has taken the responsibility to ensure their well-being. On the other hand, the presence of polyps in the area does not necessarily explain why the village would take care of the old couple."}}
{"Q": "This solid was purified. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Crystallization was used for this solid. (B) Ancient craftsmen knew how to use copper and tin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Crystallization was used for this solid.\nExplanation: Crystallization is a common method used to purify solids. It involves dissolving the solid in a solvent and then allowing the solvent to evaporate slowly, causing the solid to form crystals. The crystals can then be separated from any impurities that may have been present in the original solid. This method is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry to purify drugs and in the chemical industry to purify various chemicals. On the other hand, the fact that ancient craftsmen knew how to use copper and tin is not relevant to the purification of a solid."}}
{"Q": "They are very diverse. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are more than a million asteroids in the universe. (B) Peter and Lisa are both from the United States.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The diversity mentioned in the question is most likely referring to the diversity of asteroids, which is caused by the fact that there are more than a million asteroids in the universe. Each asteroid has its own unique composition, size, and orbit, which contributes to their diversity. Peter and Lisa being from the United States has no relevance to the diversity of asteroids."}}
{"Q": "Tom saw waves representing the ravines. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher drew a picture of local terrains. (B) The stream in front of Tom's house has been polluted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the teacher drew a picture of local terrains, which included ravines with waves. It is unlikely that the pollution of a stream would cause waves to represent ravines."}}
{"Q": "Books surrounding me cause my desire to read. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My research interest is about Literature. (B) I am sitting in the library.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that the person is sitting in the library, surrounded by books, which is causing their desire to read. Being in a library environment with books readily available can naturally stimulate a person's interest in reading. While it is possible that the person's research interest in literature could also contribute to their desire to read, the immediate cause in this scenario is the physical presence of books in the library."}}
{"Q": "Many people lived in the kingdom. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The king's kingdom is a huge collection of individuals. (B) There used to be a kingdom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The king's kingdom is a huge collection of individuals.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the kingdom is populated by many people due to the size and scope of the king's rule. It implies that the king has a large territory and a significant population under his control, which would naturally lead to a high number of people living in the kingdom. On the other hand, option B is not a valid explanation as it simply states that there used to be a kingdom without providing any context or explanation for why people lived there."}}
{"Q": "He found that it had grey bark. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found a turtle. (B) Jack looked carefully at the baobabs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jack looked carefully at the baobabs.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"it\" had grey bark, but it does not specify what \"it\" refers to. However, the context suggests that Jack was observing baobab trees, which are known for their distinctive grey bark. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the grey bark was Jack's observation of the baobabs, rather than the random discovery of a turtle."}}
{"Q": "I began to improve its reproducibility. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I search for a kind of fibre via its structure. (B) My mentor stressed the realibility of my measurement.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the mentor stressed the reliability of the measurement. This is because the statement suggests that the reproducibility of the measurement improved, which implies that there were issues with the measurement's reliability before. Therefore, it is likely that the mentor identified this issue and emphasized the importance of ensuring the measurement's accuracy and consistency. While searching for a kind of fiber via its structure may also contribute to improving reproducibility, it is less likely to be the primary cause in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Tom touched the heating steel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His felt the scalding steel. (B) The metal shaft began to rotate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His felt the scalding steel.\nExplanation: When Tom touched the heating steel, he would have felt the heat and the burning sensation on his skin. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests that the metal shaft began to rotate, which is not a likely outcome of touching a heating steel."}}
{"Q": "Rabbits rarely get sick. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom kills ten rabbits and gets their venules. (B) He often feeds herbs to rabbits.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He often feeds herbs to rabbits.\nExplanation: Feeding herbs to rabbits can boost their immune system and prevent them from getting sick. This is a more plausible answer than option (A), which involves killing rabbits and taking their venules, which is not a common practice and does not have any known benefits for rabbit health."}}
{"Q": "This factory raises a lot of rabbits and foxs. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Fur companies often come to the factory to buy leather. (B) This factory is actually a zoo.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the factory raises rabbits and foxes for their fur, which is then sold to fur companies. This is a common practice in the fur industry. The option B, that the factory is actually a zoo, is less plausible as zoos typically do not raise animals for their fur and it would be unlikely for a zoo to have a large number of rabbits and foxes."}}
{"Q": "His group begins advertising. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wants to promote his dental health. (B) Tom wants to be president.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom wants to be president.\nExplanation: The fact that his group begins advertising suggests that Tom is running for a position that requires promotion, such as a political office. Option A, promoting dental health, does not seem to be a strong enough reason to warrant advertising by a group. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Many people have experienced the violent treatment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There has been a historic battle in this city. (B) The war began.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The outbreak of war often leads to violence and mistreatment of civilians. It is a plausible explanation for why many people have experienced violent treatment. A historic battle in the city may have also contributed to the violence, but it is less likely to be the sole cause."}}
{"Q": "Syntax is not very easy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The structure of sentences can be complicated. (B) The structure of sentences can be limited.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The structure of sentences can be complicated due to the various rules and conventions that govern syntax. These rules include word order, sentence structure, and the use of punctuation, which can make it difficult for learners to understand and use syntax correctly. Additionally, the complexity of syntax can vary depending on the language being learned, as different languages have different rules and structures. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of difficulty in learning syntax is the complexity of sentence structure rather than its limitations."}}
{"Q": "He found that was a spermaceti. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has bought something in a waxy solid state. (B) Jack looked at part of the reproductive structure of the fungus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has bought something in a waxy solid state.\nExplanation: Spermaceti is a waxy substance found in the head of the sperm whale. Therefore, it is unlikely that Jack would have found it while looking at a fungus's reproductive structure. Option A is more plausible as Tom could have purchased a product that contained spermaceti in a waxy solid state."}}
{"Q": "Tom got distracted during the exam. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wasted a lot of time. (B) He got a failure in the examination.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He wasted a lot of time.\nExplanation: If Tom got distracted during the exam, it is more likely that he wasted a lot of time rather than getting a failure in the examination. Getting a failure would depend on how much time he wasted and how much of the exam he was able to complete. However, wasting time is a more immediate consequence of getting distracted during an exam."}}
{"Q": "Rita has been jogging for two hours and oxygen in her blood is declining. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her face looks not as red as she just started jogging. (B) She often eats protein rich foods to synthesize red blood cells.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: As Rita has been jogging for two hours, her body is using up oxygen to produce energy for her muscles. This means that the oxygen levels in her blood are decreasing, which can cause her face to look less red than when she first started jogging. This is because the redness in her face is caused by increased blood flow to the area, which is needed to deliver oxygen to the muscles. As the oxygen levels in her blood decrease, the blood vessels in her face may constrict, causing the redness to fade. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is not directly related to the decline in oxygen levels in her blood."}}
{"Q": "The villagers found very small microcrystalline interstitial patches. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) One of them recognized it as a plagioclase. (B) He found that during this process the organelle had a specific purpose within the cell.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. One of them recognized it as a plagioclase.\nExplanation: The discovery of microcrystalline interstitial patches is more likely to be related to the field of geology or mineralogy rather than biology. Plagioclase is a common mineral found in igneous rocks and is often identified by its microcrystalline structure. Therefore, it is more plausible that one of the villagers recognized the patches as plagioclase rather than discovering a new organelle within a cell."}}
{"Q": "They reproduce more geerations. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are more dugongs crowded in the sea. (B) Researchers want to get granulocytes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The statement suggests that dugongs are reproducing more generations, which implies an increase in their population. The most plausible reason for this is that there are more dugongs crowded in the sea, leading to a higher chance of successful mating and reproduction. Option B, which suggests that researchers want to get granulocytes, is not related to the reproductive behavior of dugongs and is therefore an unlikely cause for the observed phenomenon."}}
{"Q": "Upper Cave Men lived in humble dens surrounded by rocks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was suggested that they resolved conflicts through fight. (B) Scientists thus deduce they have mastered the skill to burrow soil.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Upper Cave Men lived in humble dens surrounded by rocks does not necessarily imply that they had the skill to burrow soil. However, it is more likely that they resolved conflicts through fight, as living in such a harsh environment would have required them to be physically strong and able to defend themselves and their resources. This is a more plausible answer based on the information given."}}
{"Q": "The air is not fresh in my van. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I want to open the window. (B) I try to keep it from coldness.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I want to open the window.\nExplanation: If the air in the van is not fresh, it is likely that there is a buildup of stale air, odors, or pollutants. Opening the window can help to circulate fresh air into the van and improve the air quality. Trying to keep it from coldness (option B) is not directly related to the issue of stale air and would not necessarily improve the situation."}}
{"Q": "Tom hasn't washed his hair for a long period. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom also has wrinkles at thirties. (B) There are a lot of head lice on his hair.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: If Tom hasn't washed his hair for a long period, it is more likely that he would have head lice on his hair. Not washing hair regularly can lead to the accumulation of dirt, oil, and dead skin cells on the scalp, which can attract head lice. Wrinkles at thirties, on the other hand, are not directly related to not washing hair and can be caused by various factors such as sun exposure, smoking, and genetics. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Aunt Li is in charge of cleaning. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom brings a bucket and start cleaning the dirty floor. (B) She always sneezes at work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Since Aunt Li is in charge of cleaning, it is likely that someone will start cleaning the dirty floor. Tom bringing a bucket and starting to clean the floor is a plausible outcome. Aunt Li sneezing at work is not necessarily a direct result of her being in charge of cleaning."}}
{"Q": "Her mother picks some cone-shaped flowers from the hop vine in the yard. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary wants some hops to make beer. (B) Mary wants some lilac flowers to decorate her room.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mary wants some hops to make beer.\n\nExplanation: The hop vine is commonly used to make beer, and the cone-shaped flowers are the part of the plant that is used in the brewing process. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mary's mother picked the flowers for the purpose of making beer rather than for decorating a room with lilac flowers."}}
{"Q": "A couple were infected by different bacterium. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Both of them took Penicillins and recovered. (B) The effect on the male patient is different from that on the female patient.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The effect on the male patient is different from that on the female patient.\n\nExplanation: Different bacteria can cause different infections and have different responses to antibiotics. Therefore, it is possible that the bacterium that infected the male patient may have a different response to antibiotics than the bacterium that infected the female patient. As a result, the effect on each patient may be different, and they may require different treatments to recover."}}
{"Q": "The fishermen put four octopuses in a tub. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They fought fiercely with each other. (B) They lived a good life there.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They fought fiercely with each other.\nExplanation: Octopuses are known to be solitary creatures and are territorial in nature. Putting four octopuses in a small tub would result in them competing for space and resources, leading to aggressive behavior and fights. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would fight fiercely with each other rather than living a good life in a cramped tub."}}
{"Q": "This man had cancer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This man had suffered from hypercalcaemia. (B) The man was exposed to Promethium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) This man had suffered from hypercalcaemia.\nExplanation: Hypercalcaemia is a condition where there is an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood. This can lead to the development of cancer, as high levels of calcium can cause damage to cells and DNA. Additionally, hypercalcaemia can also weaken the immune system, making it more difficult for the body to fight off cancer cells. On the other hand, exposure to Promethium, a radioactive element, can increase the risk of cancer, but it is not a common cause of cancer in humans. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The seeds on the ground were decreasing. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many Chipmunks selected this forest as their habitat. (B) The beaker was broken into pieces.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Many Chipmunks selected this forest as their habitat.\nExplanation: Chipmunks are known to eat seeds and store them for the winter. If many chipmunks have selected this forest as their habitat, they could be consuming a large amount of the seeds on the ground, leading to a decrease in their numbers. On the other hand, the beaker being broken into pieces has no direct relation to the seeds on the ground."}}
{"Q": "Our brain can't control the knee reflex. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The neuronal signals of the knee reflex are not transmitted to the brain. (B) Knee jumping reflex is an unconditioned reflex.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Knee jumping reflex is an unconditioned reflex.\n\nExplanation: The knee jumping reflex, also known as the patellar reflex, is an example of an unconditioned reflex, which means it is an automatic response that does not require conscious control from the brain. The reflex arc responsible for the knee jerk involves sensory neurons that detect the stretch of the quadriceps muscle and send signals directly to the spinal cord, which then triggers the motor neurons to contract the muscle and cause the knee to jerk. Therefore, the brain does not need to be involved in this reflex, and it cannot control it."}}
{"Q": "The rate of plasma protein formation in mice decreased rapidly while the rate of albumin formation unchanged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Solutes chromatographically reacted with the micelles. (B) The researchers injected the mice with interleukins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The researchers injected the mice with interleukins.\n\nExplanation: Interleukins are signaling molecules that play a role in the immune response. They can affect the production of plasma proteins, including albumin. If the researchers injected the mice with interleukins, it is possible that the decrease in plasma protein formation was a result of this intervention. Solutes chromatographically reacting with micelles is not a likely explanation for this phenomenon."}}
{"Q": "He only observed the reaction of glycolysis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob measured the amount of a at the beginning of the reaction. (B) Tom eliminated all the mitochondria within a cell and observed the reactions occurring in it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Tom eliminated all the mitochondria within a cell, then the cell would not be able to undergo cellular respiration, which occurs in the mitochondria. This would force the cell to rely solely on glycolysis for energy production, making it the only observable reaction. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer. Option A does not provide a clear explanation for why Bob only observed the reaction of glycolysis."}}
{"Q": "People thawed these fish, but their cells were damaged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fish in this pond are frozen. (B) People want to kill these fish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The fish in this pond are frozen.\nExplanation: When fish are frozen, ice crystals can form within their cells, causing damage to the cell walls and membranes. When the fish are thawed, the damaged cells may not function properly, leading to further damage and potentially spoiling the fish. This is a common problem with frozen fish and is likely the cause of the cell damage in this scenario. Choice (B) is not a plausible answer as there is no indication that people want to kill the fish in this situation."}}
{"Q": "They choose to take action on summer nights. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bears can stand more extreme coldness than other animals. (B) Researchers want to observe stinkpots closely.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The fact that they choose to take action on summer nights suggests that the researchers are interested in observing stinkpots closely. This is a more plausible explanation than choice A, which is unrelated to the behavior described. Stinkpots are nocturnal animals, so observing them at night would likely yield more information than during the day. Additionally, summer nights may be more comfortable for the researchers to work in than colder nights."}}
{"Q": "Jack looks at the family photo. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack finds that every person in the photo has a different mouth shape. (B) Jack finds that every person in the photo has a different nose shape.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jack finds that every person in the photo has a different mouth shape.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack would notice differences in mouth shapes rather than nose shapes as mouths are more expressive and noticeable in photographs. Additionally, people tend to have more variation in their mouth shapes compared to their nose shapes."}}
{"Q": "Peter went to the supermarket and bought a lot of pumpkins. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor advised Peter to eat more foods rich in carotene. (B) The climate here is very adorable for plants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The doctor advised Peter to eat more foods rich in carotene, which is found in pumpkins. This is a plausible reason for Peter to buy a lot of pumpkins at the supermarket. The climate being adorable for plants is not a direct reason for Peter to buy pumpkins."}}
{"Q": "Givenchy, who works in the petrochemical industry, wants to explore a catalyst. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His friend recommended naphthalene to him. (B) Givenchy found zeolites.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Givenchy found zeolites.\nExplanation: Givenchy's interest in exploring a catalyst led him to research and experimentation, which eventually led him to discover zeolites as a potential catalyst. It is more plausible that he would discover a catalyst through his own research and experimentation rather than simply receiving a recommendation from a friend. Additionally, naphthalene is not commonly used as a catalyst in the petrochemical industry, making it less likely to be recommended to Givenchy."}}
{"Q": "The doves are pregnant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They pay close attention to their baby. (B) Eggs appeared in their nests.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Eggs appeared in their nests.\nExplanation: Doves lay eggs when they are pregnant, so it is more plausible that the doves laid eggs in their nests as a result of being pregnant. While doves do care for their young, paying close attention to their baby is not a direct result of being pregnant."}}
{"Q": "Her depression has never been treated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She gets addicted to alcohol. (B) She often takes a medicine containing tamoxifen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She gets addicted to alcohol.\nExplanation: Untreated depression can lead to self-medication with substances such as alcohol, which can provide temporary relief but ultimately worsen the depression and lead to addiction. Tamoxifen is a medication used to treat breast cancer and is not typically used for depression."}}
{"Q": "Tom put the frozen meat in the water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The frozen meat melted after an hour. (B) An hour later the frozen meat was gone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The frozen meat melted after an hour.\nExplanation: When frozen meat is put in water, it will start to thaw and eventually melt. However, it would take longer than an hour for the meat to completely disappear, so option B is not a plausible answer. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "We went to the hospital to detect genetic disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I cursed a lot in this process. (B) The doctor used pedigrees.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The doctor used pedigrees.\nExplanation: When detecting genetic diseases, doctors often use pedigrees to trace the inheritance pattern of the disease in a family. This helps them to determine the likelihood of a person inheriting the disease and to provide appropriate genetic counseling and testing. While the process can be stressful and emotional, cursing is not a typical or necessary part of it."}}
{"Q": "My dad was freed from the disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The immature mosquitoes in his room were killed. (B) We were pleased at his remission.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. We were pleased at his remission.\nExplanation: The statement \"my dad was freed from the disease\" implies that he recovered from the illness. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result would be that his family was happy and relieved at his remission rather than the immature mosquitoes in his room being killed."}}
{"Q": "Mary found that the smaller the view,the greater the magnification. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary adjusted the angle of lens to observe the specimen. (B) This object revolved on its own axis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mary adjusted the angle of lens to observe the specimen.\n\nExplanation: When Mary adjusted the angle of the lens, she changed the distance between the lens and the specimen. As the distance between the lens and the specimen decreased, the magnification increased. This is because the lens was able to focus the light from the specimen more closely, resulting in a larger image. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the smaller view and greater magnification was due to Mary adjusting the angle of the lens rather than the object revolving on its own axis."}}
{"Q": "The animals they vivisect have to   suffer the pain of being dissected soberly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Students dissect monocotyledons. (B) Some scientists vivisect animals to get the most accurate statistics.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Vivisection is the practice of performing surgery on living animals for scientific research. Some scientists believe that vivisection is necessary to obtain accurate statistics and data for medical research. However, this practice often causes pain and suffering to the animals being dissected. Monocotyledons are a type of plant and are not typically used in vivisection. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The peach tree finishes the beginning of its reproduction. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fruits are ripe in autumn. (B) The peach flowers have faded and peaches emerge one by one.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The peach flowers have faded and peaches emerge one by one.\n\nExplanation: After the peach tree blooms, the flowers will eventually fade and the fruit will begin to develop. This process takes time, and the peaches will emerge one by one as they ripen. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the peach tree finishing the beginning of its reproduction is due to the fading of the flowers and the emergence of the fruit. Option A is incorrect because it only describes the timing of the ripening of the fruit, not the cause of the end of the reproduction process."}}
{"Q": "He usually takes a trip. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom always has convulsions. (B) He is a naturalist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He is a naturalist.\nExplanation: The fact that he usually takes a trip suggests that he has a strong interest in exploring nature and the outdoors, which is consistent with being a naturalist. Option A, which suggests that he has convulsions, is not supported by the given information and is therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "She was rejected by all of the agencies. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary wants to be a success woman. (B) A middle school student, Lily, took part in many interviews of several agencies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"she\" was rejected by all of the agencies, implying that Mary was the one being referred to. The reason for her rejection is given as \"wanting to be a successful woman,\" which may not be a specific enough goal or may not align with the agencies' criteria for representation. Lily's participation in interviews is not relevant to the sentence and is therefore an unlikely cause for Mary's rejection."}}
{"Q": "We srayed aerosol into the air to imitate that. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We wanted to imitate the cloud' reflection of sunlight. (B) We needed to imitate the mirror' reflection of sunlight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: We wanted to imitate the cloud's reflection of sunlight. Aerosols, such as water droplets or dust particles, can scatter sunlight and create a similar effect to the reflection of sunlight off of clouds. This may have been done for scientific research or for visual effects in a film or photography. It is unlikely that the purpose was to imitate a mirror's reflection, as mirrors reflect light in a different way than clouds do."}}
{"Q": "He had just finished his meal, but soon he was hungry again. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gatsby drank a lot of yogurt. (B) Tom put his porridge into the microwave oven.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Gatsby drank a lot of yogurt.\nExplanation: Yogurt is a dairy product that is high in protein and can help to keep a person feeling full for longer. However, if someone drinks a lot of yogurt, they may feel hungry again sooner than if they had eaten a more substantial meal. Therefore, it is more plausible that Gatsby's hunger was caused by drinking a lot of yogurt rather than Tom putting his porridge into the microwave oven."}}
{"Q": "People don't enter it to avoid Infection. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This forest has infected ticks. (B) The seedling has developed a primary infection.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This forest has infected ticks.\nExplanation: Infected ticks can transmit diseases such as Lyme disease, which can be harmful to humans. Therefore, people may avoid entering a forest known to have infected ticks to avoid getting bitten and infected. On the other hand, a seedling developing a primary infection would not be a reason for people to avoid entering a forest."}}
{"Q": "The boy has a rubella. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got infected again recently. (B) He goes for an antiviral vaccine injection.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He got infected again recently.\nExplanation: Rubella is a viral infection that usually occurs once in a lifetime, and once a person has had it, they develop immunity to it. Therefore, the boy cannot receive an antiviral vaccine injection for rubella as there is no cure for the virus. The only plausible explanation is that he got infected again recently."}}
{"Q": "Economist was attracted by this aberration. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This country in recessions had a city with prosperity. (B) There was a serious problem of corrosion in lithospheres.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This country in recessions had a city with prosperity.\n\nExplanation: Economists are interested in aberrations, or deviations from the norm, and in this case, the aberration is a city with prosperity during a recession in the country. This suggests that there may be unique factors at play in the city that are driving its economic success despite the broader economic downturn. Option B, which suggests a problem with corrosion in lithospheres, is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the economic situation described in the question."}}
{"Q": "He needed to calculated their task completion rates. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The teacher provided them with a variety of pedons. (B) The boss was to assess staff performance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The boss was to assess staff performance.\nExplanation: Calculating task completion rates is a common way for a boss to assess the performance of their staff. It allows them to see how efficiently tasks are being completed and identify areas where improvements can be made. Option A, about the teacher providing pedons, is not relevant to the context and does not explain why task completion rates need to be calculated. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I saw many fetishistic elements. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I went into a temple of shamanism. (B) I went into a temple of books.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I went into a temple of books.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the fetishistic elements were seen in a temple of books, such as a library or bookstore, as books can be objects of obsession or desire for avid readers. This could include collecting rare or antique books, having a specific attachment to a certain author or genre, or even fetishizing the physical aspects of books such as their smell or texture. In contrast, a temple of shamanism may have spiritual or ritualistic elements, but fetishism is not typically associated with this practice."}}
{"Q": "The government published a ne policy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The government announced the abolition of all taxes. (B) The public knew its meaning.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The public knew its meaning.\nExplanation: When the government publishes a new policy, it is likely that the public will become aware of it and try to understand its implications. However, it is highly unlikely that the government would announce the abolition of all taxes as a result of a new policy. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was sunburned. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's skin was exposed to the sun for a long time. (B) Tom's skin has been itchy lately.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom's skin was exposed to the sun for a long time.\nExplanation: Sunburn is caused by overexposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. When the skin is exposed to UV rays for a prolonged period, it can cause damage to the skin cells, leading to redness, pain, and peeling. Itching is not a direct cause of sunburn, although it can be a symptom of other skin conditions that may increase the risk of sunburn, such as eczema or psoriasis. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy suffers from tinea. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The boy is prone to sweating excessively. (B) This boy was exposed to contaminated rat urine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Tinea, also known as ringworm, is a fungal infection that thrives in warm and moist environments. Excessive sweating can create such an environment, making the individual more susceptible to developing tinea. On the other hand, exposure to contaminated rat urine can lead to leptospirosis, a bacterial infection that causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to liver and kidney damage, but it is not a known cause of tinea. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He is exhausted now with full fatigue. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Zachary has been bothered by migraine pain for hours. (B) He has been busy all day long.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He has been busy all day long.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Zachary's exhaustion and fatigue are due to being busy all day long rather than being bothered by migraine pain for hours. Being busy can cause physical and mental exhaustion, while migraine pain may cause discomfort and pain but not necessarily full fatigue."}}
{"Q": "Jerry sweated a lot. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He became fatter. (B) He had a cramp.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He had a cramp.\nExplanation: Sweating excessively can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can cause muscle cramps. It is unlikely that sweating alone would cause someone to become fatter."}}
{"Q": "It's an estuary. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It's a very special environment here. (B) The riverbed here twists and turns.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The riverbed here twists and turns.\nExplanation: Estuaries are formed when freshwater rivers meet and mix with saltwater from the ocean. The twisting and turning of the riverbed in this area likely created a slow-moving, shallow area where the freshwater and saltwater could mix and form an estuary. This mixing of water creates a unique environment that supports a diverse range of plant and animal life. While it is possible that this area is also special in other ways, the twisting and turning of the riverbed is a more plausible explanation for the formation of an estuary."}}
{"Q": "The bank raised interest on savings to attract the public. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The number of citizens coming to the bank to make deposits has increased. (B) Their clients were attracted and decided to cooperate with them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The number of citizens coming to the bank to make deposits has increased.\nExplanation: When a bank raises interest rates on savings, it becomes more attractive for people to deposit their money in that bank. This is because they can earn more interest on their savings, which is a benefit for them. As a result, more people are likely to come to the bank to make deposits, which increases the number of customers for the bank. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B is not as likely because it is not clear what is meant by \"cooperate with them\" and it is not directly related to the bank's interest rates on savings."}}
{"Q": "Jack leaves Beijing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack suffered from disassociation mentally. (B) He dropped out from the university.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: There is no information in the question that suggests Jack suffered from disassociation mentally. However, it is possible that leaving Beijing may have led to Jack dropping out from the university if he was studying there and had to leave before completing his degree. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have collected a lot of invertebrates. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientist can cleary classify them. (B) The scientist have done a lot of researches.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Collecting a lot of invertebrates can help scientists to clearly classify them. Invertebrates are a diverse group of animals that lack a backbone, and there are many different species within this group. By collecting a large number of specimens, scientists can study their physical characteristics, behavior, and genetics to better understand how they are related to each other and how they fit into the larger ecosystem. This can help them to create more accurate taxonomic classifications and to identify new species that were previously unknown."}}
{"Q": "Logan put some neodymium into a beaker of liquid magnesium. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The neodymium dissolved. (B) The neodymium didn't dissolve.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The neodymium didn't dissolve.\nExplanation: Neodymium is a rare earth metal and is known to be highly reactive with water and acids, but not with liquid magnesium. Therefore, it is unlikely that the neodymium would dissolve in the beaker of liquid magnesium. Instead, it may form a layer on the surface or sink to the bottom of the beaker."}}
{"Q": "He found that they reached the same height. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Luck checked the basketball in his hand. (B) Tom has seen two spruces.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Luck checked the basketball in his hand.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Luck's action of checking the basketball in his hand caused them to reach the same height. This could be because he adjusted his grip or angle of release, resulting in a more accurate shot. On the other hand, Tom seeing two spruces does not seem to have any direct correlation with the height they reached."}}
{"Q": "Tom was suffered a strange skin disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Herpes entered his body through tiny passages in his skin. (B) The doctor suggested that he should take use of the phytotherapy and buy some medicine containing natural plants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the doctor would suggest phytotherapy and natural medicine for a skin disease rather than herpes entering his body through tiny passages in his skin. Herpes is a viral infection that is typically transmitted through direct contact with an infected person or object, and it is unlikely to be caused by a skin disease. On the other hand, phytotherapy and natural medicine are often used to treat skin conditions and can be effective in reducing inflammation and promoting healing."}}
{"Q": "He took a lot of pictures of different animals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has been studying animal living habits recently. (B) John went to the zoo to see the theropods.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has been studying animal living habits recently.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person took a lot of pictures of different animals, which indicates a purposeful action. Option A provides a plausible reason for this action, as studying animal living habits would require observing and documenting different animals. Option B, on the other hand, only mentions a specific type of animal (theropods) and does not provide a broader reason for taking pictures of different animals. Therefore, option A is a more likely explanation."}}
{"Q": "She has good credits. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Linda always pays her debt in time. (B) Lucy has a good ability of expression.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Linda always pays her debt in time.\nExplanation: Good credit is typically determined by a person's history of paying their debts on time. Therefore, it is more plausible that Linda's good credit is due to her habit of paying her debts on time, rather than her ability of expression."}}
{"Q": "He has a need for heating. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought a heater. (B) He is cruel to animals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He bought a heater.\nExplanation: It is logical that if someone has a need for heating, they would purchase a heater to fulfill that need. Option B, \"He is cruel to animals,\" is not related to the original statement and does not make sense as a result of needing heating."}}
{"Q": "She found the  foul-tasting liquid from their limbs smelly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The experimenter studied ancient cultivated crops. (B) Lucy smelt the ladybugs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Lucy smelt the ladybugs.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the foul-tasting liquid was from \"their limbs,\" which suggests that it was coming from the ladybugs. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer as it suggests that Lucy was able to smell the ladybugs and found their odor unpleasant. Option A, on the other hand, is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide any explanation for the foul smell."}}
{"Q": "Recently, it has entered the flowering stage. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This cockatoo has recently been beating the trunk of a tree with a small wooden branch every day. (B) Tom bought a bulb two years ago.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the flowering stage was caused by Tom buying a bulb two years ago. This suggests that the plant is a bulb plant, which typically have a specific growth cycle that includes a dormant period followed by a flowering stage. The plant may have been in its dormant period for the past two years and has now entered the flowering stage due to the appropriate environmental conditions. The action of the cockatoo beating the trunk of a tree with a small wooden branch is unlikely to have caused the plant to enter the flowering stage."}}
{"Q": "He applied it on his back, hands and feet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom bought a plaster to treat the rash. (B) Tom had pain in his knee, so he had the pressure points test.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom bought a plaster to treat the rash.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that Tom applied something on his back, hands, and feet. This suggests that he had some kind of skin irritation or rash that he was trying to treat. Option A is the most plausible answer as it directly addresses the issue of a rash and the use of a plaster to treat it. Option B, on the other hand, talks about knee pain and pressure point tests, which are not related to the information given in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Tanager belongs to sparrow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tanager is fed on worms. (B) All the tail snakes under this land ran away to other places.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tanager is fed on worms.\nExplanation: The statement \"Tanager belongs to sparrow\" is not clear and seems to be incomplete or incorrect. However, assuming that it means Tanager is a type of bird that is related to sparrows, it is more plausible that Tanager would eat worms like many other bird species, rather than causing all the tail snakes in the area to run away. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "Mary devotes herself in feminism course. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The meal consists of rice, potatoes and vegetables. (B) Mary is a feminist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The statement clearly states that Mary devotes herself in feminism course, indicating that she has an interest in the subject and identifies as a feminist. Choice A, which talks about a meal, is irrelevant and has no connection to the statement. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They looked for the protocols for explaination. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They encountered an incident. (B) Tom desired to know the scientific explanation of the word.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The use of the word \"incident\" suggests that something unexpected or unusual occurred, which prompted the search for protocols to explain the situation. It is more likely that the need for protocols arose due to an incident rather than simply because Tom wanted to know the scientific explanation of something."}}
{"Q": "Someone offered clues accoding to the photo they posted online. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A couple of parents are playing in the park with their child. (B) A couple of parents are looking for their lost child.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) A couple of parents are looking for their lost child.\nExplanation: The fact that someone posted a photo and offered clues suggests that they are trying to help locate a missing child. If the parents were simply playing with their child in the park, there would be no need for clues or assistance from others. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a transsexual. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The  reassignment expressed his perceived inner identities. (B) He also had basic needs to make love as others.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The reassignment expressed his perceived inner identities.\nExplanation: Transsexual individuals often experience a disconnect between their gender identity and their physical body. For Tom, undergoing gender reassignment surgery allowed him to align his physical body with his perceived inner identity, which can lead to improved mental health and overall well-being. While sexual needs are important for all individuals, it is not necessarily the primary reason for undergoing gender reassignment surgery."}}
{"Q": "Bob decreased the speed to 50km/h. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The racers entered the deceleration phase. (B) Tom wants to accelerate the speed of the chemical reaction.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the racers entered the deceleration phase, which caused Bob to decrease the speed to 50km/h. In a race, there are different phases, including acceleration, cruising, and deceleration. Deceleration is when the racers slow down to prepare for a turn or to avoid an obstacle. Therefore, it makes sense that Bob would decrease the speed in response to the racers entering this phase. Option B, which suggests that Tom wants to accelerate the speed of a chemical reaction, is not relevant to the context of the question and is therefore an unlikely explanation."}}
{"Q": "My pet was infected by microscopic animals called coccidia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It had Coccidiosis. (B) It had a cold.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It had Coccidiosis.\nExplanation: Coccidia are microscopic parasites that can infect the intestines of animals, including pets. When an animal is infected with coccidia, it can develop a condition called coccidiosis. Symptoms of coccidiosis can include diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, and dehydration. Therefore, it is more plausible that the pet had coccidiosis as a result of being infected with coccidia. A cold is a respiratory illness caused by a virus, and it is not related to coccidia or coccidiosis."}}
{"Q": "There are few tree on the mountain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This mountain often has mudslides. (B) The birds can't fly over.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This mountain often has mudslides.\nExplanation: Trees play a crucial role in preventing soil erosion and stabilizing slopes. Without trees, the soil on the mountain is more likely to erode and cause mudslides, especially during heavy rainfall or storms. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lack of trees on the mountain would result in frequent mudslides. The option B, stating that birds can't fly over, is less likely to be a direct consequence of the absence of trees on the mountain."}}
{"Q": "Mario introduces his topic through a presentation while Mary just gives a speech orally. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mario draws more attention. (B) Mary draws more attention.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mario draws more attention.\nExplanation: Since Mario is using a presentation, he is likely to have visual aids such as slides, images, and videos that can help him engage the audience and make his points more effectively. This can make his presentation more interesting and memorable, and therefore draw more attention from the audience. On the other hand, Mary's speech may lack such visual aids, which can make it less engaging and less likely to capture the audience's attention. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mario draws more attention than Mary."}}
{"Q": "Contraception is advocated here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The peotries of Shakespeare always talks about the inner struggle of humankind. (B) Women's health care is valued in the country.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The advocacy for contraception suggests that women's health care is valued in the country. Contraception is a crucial aspect of women's health care as it allows them to plan their families and prevent unintended pregnancies, which can have negative impacts on their physical and mental health. The mention of Shakespeare's poetry is irrelevant to the topic of contraception and does not provide a plausible explanation for its advocacy."}}
{"Q": "The identity of the dead body should be clarified. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The police will carry deep investigations. (B) Calcification happens.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The police will carry deep investigations.\nExplanation: When the identity of a dead body is not clear, it is the responsibility of the police to investigate and determine who the person was. This may involve DNA testing, fingerprint analysis, and other methods to identify the individual. Once the identity is established, the police can then proceed with their investigation into the circumstances surrounding the person's death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the police will carry out deep investigations to clarify the identity of the dead body. Option B, calcification, is not relevant to the situation and does not provide a logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "The technician set  wrong computer commands. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mainframe stopped working immediately. . (B) The robot can't work properly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The robot can't work properly.\nExplanation: If the technician set wrong computer commands for the robot, it is more likely that the robot will not be able to function properly. The mainframe stopping working immediately is less likely as it would require a more severe error or malfunction."}}
{"Q": "Sam has been studying tetrapods. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam has seen creatures as big as cars, and creatures as big as slaps. (B) He inputs a lot of equations.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sam has seen creatures as big as cars, and creatures as big as slaps.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because studying tetrapods involves learning about a wide range of animals, including those that are very large (such as elephants and whales) and those that are very small (such as frogs and salamanders). It is unlikely that studying tetrapods would involve inputting a lot of equations, as this is more typical of fields such as physics or mathematics."}}
{"Q": "She died with dignity as free from pain as possible. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary's wound became inflamed in an acute attack. (B) The dying lady hear hospice from her son.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mary's wound became inflamed in an acute attack.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned in the sentence was suffering from some kind of pain or illness. Option A states that Mary's wound became inflamed in an acute attack, which could have caused her pain and eventually led to her death. On the other hand, option B does not provide any explanation for the cause of the person's death. Therefore, option A seems to be a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom ate the undercooked plantains. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He tasted bitterness. (B) He added some acid to the solution.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He tasted bitterness.\nExplanation: Undercooked plantains can have a bitter taste due to the presence of tannins. Tannins are naturally occurring compounds found in many plants, including plantains, and can cause a bitter taste when not properly cooked. Adding acid to the solution would not be a likely result of eating undercooked plantains."}}
{"Q": "She removed the battery to dissipate heat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Susan's cell phone is very hot after use. (B) Mary is getting older and older.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Susan's cell phone is very hot after use, it could be due to excessive usage or a malfunctioning battery. Removing the battery can help dissipate the heat and prevent damage to the phone. On the other hand, Mary getting older has no relevance to the situation and is an unrelated statement."}}
{"Q": "Tom bakes biscuit in this shop. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He needs novel ideas to bake new biscuits. (B) Tom works there as a salesman.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If Tom bakes biscuits in the shop, it is more likely that he is a baker or a chef rather than a salesman. Therefore, it is plausible that he needs novel ideas to bake new biscuits to keep the customers interested and satisfied."}}
{"Q": "The engineer finally chose the electromagnet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The voltage of the electric field has changed. (B) Engineers are selecting materials for giant wheels.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The voltage of the electric field has changed.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the engineer \"finally chose the electromagnet,\" indicating that there was a decision-making process involved. The fact that the engineer chose the electromagnet suggests that it was the best option for the given situation. The second choice, about selecting materials for giant wheels, is not mentioned in the sentence and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Vinegars can make him allergic. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack is allergic to alcohol even in small amount. (B) The virus inside the nerve cell can be reactivated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jack is allergic to alcohol even in small amount.\nExplanation: Vinegars are made through a fermentation process that involves the conversion of alcohol into acetic acid. Therefore, vinegars contain a small amount of alcohol. If Jack is allergic to alcohol, even in small amounts, consuming vinegars can trigger an allergic reaction. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which is unrelated to the topic of vinegar allergies."}}
{"Q": "Everyone thinks Jack is a selfish person. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack doesn't brush his teeth everyday. (B) Jack always isolates himself from others and tries every means to get what he wants without paying attention to others' needs and feelings.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: Jack's behavior of isolating himself and disregarding others' needs and feelings is a more plausible reason for people to perceive him as selfish. Not brushing his teeth every day may be seen as unhygienic or lazy, but it does not necessarily make him selfish. However, consistently putting his own desires above others and not considering their perspectives can be seen as selfish behavior."}}
{"Q": "This bird dates back to the carboniferous period. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cockroaches could be its prey at that time. (B) They have reproduced many generations.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: During the Carboniferous period, which lasted from about 359 to 299 million years ago, the atmosphere had a high concentration of oxygen, which allowed for the evolution of giant insects such as cockroaches. The bird that existed during this time, called Archaeopteryx, was small and likely fed on insects, including cockroaches. Therefore, it is more plausible that cockroaches could be its prey at that time rather than the bird having reproduced many generations."}}
{"Q": "The fishes in the tank were electrocuted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom connected a socket and a fish tank with a wire. (B) Nadal put cephalopods in a fresh water fish tank.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible cause of the fishes being electrocuted is that Tom connected a socket and a fish tank with a wire. This would create an electrical current in the water, which could be fatal to the fish. Nadal putting cephalopods in a fresh water fish tank would not cause electrocution, as it is a completely different issue."}}
{"Q": "Jack's grandfather stopped breathing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor pronounced him dead. (B) Jack asked his father for help.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor pronounced him dead.\nExplanation: If someone stops breathing, it is a sign of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure, which can lead to death if not treated immediately. In this case, the most plausible outcome would be that the doctor pronounced Jack's grandfather dead. Asking for help from his father may have been a natural response, but it would not have been the immediate outcome."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to change his clothes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom soaked the pen into ink. (B) He opens the drawer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He opens the drawer.\nExplanation: There is no logical connection between Tom wanting to change his clothes and soaking a pen into ink. On the other hand, it is reasonable to assume that in order to change his clothes, Tom would need to access his wardrobe or dresser, which would involve opening a drawer. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The weather is very bad this spring. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The number of sucker is greatly reduced. (B) The flowers withered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The flowers withered.\nExplanation: Bad weather, especially excessive rain or cold temperatures, can damage or kill flowers. This can result in withering or reduced blooming. Suckers, on the other hand, are new shoots that grow from the roots of a plant and are not typically affected by weather conditions. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The nurse used a catheter to help him urinate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There is something wring with Tom's urinary system. (B) James is ill in bed and it is not convenient to go to the toilet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There is something wrong with Tom's urinary system.\nExplanation: The use of a catheter is typically done when there is a problem with the urinary system, such as a blockage or inability to urinate on one's own. It is not typically used for convenience purposes, as in option B. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Hollyhocks is their worst enemy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The forestry department fears the species invasion danger. (B) Summer comes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The forestry department fears the species invasion danger.\nExplanation: Hollyhocks are not native to many areas and can become invasive, outcompeting native plant species. The forestry department may be concerned about the potential harm to the ecosystem if hollyhocks are allowed to spread unchecked. Summer coming would not be a plausible cause for hollyhocks being their worst enemy."}}
{"Q": "I saw iridescence on it very often. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My Peafowl was locked in its cage. (B) I had a cooked sliced ham for each lunch.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Iridescence is a phenomenon where certain surfaces appear to change color depending on the angle of light hitting them. Peafowl feathers are known for their iridescence, which is caused by the microscopic structure of the feathers reflecting light in different ways. Therefore, it is more plausible that the peafowl being locked in its cage would lead to the observer seeing iridescence on its feathers, rather than having a cooked sliced ham for lunch."}}
{"Q": "The connective tissue wrapping each individual axon within the nerve contains protein. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Endoneurium contains protein. (B) Cells can manufacture proteins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Endoneurium contains protein.\nExplanation: The connective tissue wrapping each individual axon within the nerve is called endoneurium. This tissue contains protein, which helps to provide structural support and protection to the axon. Therefore, it is more plausible that the presence of protein in the connective tissue wrapping would result in the endoneurium containing protein, rather than cells being able to manufacture proteins."}}
{"Q": "Producers are in our lives. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We benefit from producers for good life quality. (B) We benefit from producers for bad life quality.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We benefit from producers for good life quality.\nExplanation: Producers play a crucial role in providing us with goods and services that we need for our daily lives. They create products that improve our quality of life, such as food, clothing, housing, and technology. Without producers, we would not have access to the things that make our lives easier and more comfortable. Therefore, it is more plausible to say that we benefit from producers for good life quality."}}
{"Q": "It is indispensable to toothpastes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ticks is sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals. (B) Calcium carbonate is a gentle abrasive.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Calcium carbonate is a gentle abrasive that helps to remove plaque and surface stains from teeth. It is a key ingredient in toothpaste and is essential for maintaining good oral hygiene. Ticks being sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals is not related to toothpaste."}}
{"Q": "John wanted to look at the list of articles. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor gave him some thrombin. (B) He looked at the bibliography and found notes in it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that John looked at the bibliography and found notes in it, as this is a logical action to take when wanting to view a list of articles. Option A, where the doctor gives him thrombin, is unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The scientists have gained new insights in their research. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The microwave has complex circuits. (B) The computer simulates the way planets move.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The computer simulates the way planets move.\nExplanation: The question states that the scientists gained new insights in their research, which implies that they made some discoveries or gained new knowledge. Option B, which mentions the computer simulating the way planets move, is more plausible as it suggests that the scientists were able to simulate and study the movement of planets, which could have led to new insights and discoveries. Option A, which mentions the complexity of microwave circuits, does not seem relevant to gaining new insights in research."}}
{"Q": "The doctor has found eosinophils in his stomach. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom had suffers from some kind of stomach condition. (B) Tom has an inflammation in his stomach.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are typically associated with allergic reactions and inflammation. Therefore, the presence of eosinophils in Tom's stomach suggests that he has an inflammation in his stomach, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as food allergies, infections, or autoimmune disorders. It is less likely that the presence of eosinophils is solely due to a stomach condition, as this would not necessarily involve inflammation."}}
{"Q": "HATs are implicated in transcriptional activation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The paralyzed people are less sensitive to nerve stimulation. (B) HATs are hot molecules.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement about HATs being implicated in transcriptional activation suggests that they play a role in gene expression. This has nothing to do with the sensitivity of paralyzed people to nerve stimulation. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer. Option B is also not a plausible answer as it is not related to the statement about HATs."}}
{"Q": "They gave birth to Billy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is a student majoring in physics. (B) Tom immigranted to Africa and met Mary.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom immigrated to Africa and met Mary.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Tom and Mary had a romantic relationship that led to the birth of their child, Billy. Option A, which states that Tom is a student majoring in physics, is not relevant to the question and does not provide any explanation for the birth of Billy."}}
{"Q": "Pathogenic microbes sometimes attack our bodys. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientist can cleary classify them. (B) Our bodies produce a lot of phenolics.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Our bodies produce a lot of phenolics.\nExplanation: When pathogenic microbes attack our bodies, our immune system responds by producing a lot of phenolics. Phenolics are a type of antioxidant that helps to protect our cells from damage caused by free radicals. They also have antimicrobial properties that can help to fight off the invading pathogens. Therefore, it is more plausible that our bodies produce a lot of phenolics in response to pathogenic microbes rather than scientists being able to clearly classify them, as classification of microbes requires extensive testing and analysis."}}
{"Q": "The researchers chose muons. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This experiment requires a particle that have exactly the same interactions as electrons. (B) The factory hired workers to dig the ground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This experiment requires a particle that have exactly the same interactions as electrons.\n\nExplanation: Muons are subatomic particles that are similar to electrons in terms of their interactions with matter. They are heavier than electrons, but they have the same charge and can be used to study the behavior of electrons in different materials. Therefore, the researchers chose muons for their experiment because they needed a particle that would behave similarly to electrons. The option B is not related to the choice of muons for the experiment."}}
{"Q": "Tom keeps scratching where he suffers from eczema. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is allergic to animal fur. (B) His eczema covers more and more skin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His eczema covers more and more skin.\nExplanation: Scratching eczema can cause the skin to become more irritated and inflamed, leading to the spread of the condition to other areas of the body. This is a common symptom of eczema and can be worsened by scratching. Allergies to animal fur may also cause skin irritation, but this is not necessarily related to eczema."}}
{"Q": "He learns how to recognize  the energe essence of emotions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim is learning the skill of mindfulness. (B) Mark becomes a ventriloquist after years of training.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Learning how to recognize the energy essence of emotions is a skill commonly taught in mindfulness practices. Through mindfulness, individuals learn to observe their thoughts and emotions without judgment, allowing them to better understand and manage their emotional responses. On the other hand, becoming a ventriloquist has no direct correlation to recognizing the energy essence of emotions."}}
{"Q": "The doctor gave her aspirin as a substitute. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She can not stand the old drug's effect. (B) This drug has been used up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She can not stand the old drug's effect.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the doctor gave her aspirin as a substitute, implying that she was previously taking another drug. The reason for the substitution is given as \"she can not stand the old drug's effect,\" indicating that the previous drug was causing some negative side effects or reactions. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not a valid reason for switching to aspirin as it suggests that the previous drug was simply used up, which would not be a sufficient reason for a doctor to change a patient's medication."}}
{"Q": "Tom has overcomed a lot of barriers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has to find one more person. (B) He finally succeeded.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He finally succeeded.\nExplanation: Overcoming barriers implies that Tom faced challenges or obstacles that were preventing him from achieving his goals. By overcoming these barriers, Tom was able to succeed in his endeavors. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of overcoming barriers would be success rather than having to find one more person."}}
{"Q": "Jack doesn't like vegetables with slender stalks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) But paramecium is an exception. (B) He never eats celery.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He never eats celery.\nExplanation: The statement clearly states that Jack doesn't like vegetables with slender stalks. Celery is a vegetable with a slender stalk, so it can be inferred that Jack never eats celery. Option A is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the given statement."}}
{"Q": "Piroplasmosis has spread in this area. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Numerous livestock in this area died which causes great economic loss. (B) The size of the population is affected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Numerous livestock in this area died which causes great economic loss.\n\nExplanation: Piroplasmosis is a tick-borne disease that affects livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats. It can cause anemia, fever, and even death in severe cases. If the disease has spread in the area, it is likely that many livestock have been infected and died, leading to a significant economic loss for the farmers and the community. The size of the population may not be directly affected by piroplasmosis, as it is not a human disease, but the loss of livestock can indirectly impact the availability of food and resources for the community."}}
{"Q": "Mr. Howard added titanium dioxide as raw material when making corundum. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He succeeded in making sapphire. (B) He got some small melons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He succeeded in making sapphire.\nExplanation: Titanium dioxide is a common additive used in the production of synthetic sapphire, which is a type of corundum. When added to the raw materials, it helps to improve the crystal structure and overall quality of the sapphire. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mr. Howard was successful in making sapphire rather than getting small melons."}}
{"Q": "Tom is poor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom can not afford beef. (B) He bought cleanser essence for treatment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom can not afford beef.\nExplanation: Being poor means having limited financial resources. As a result, Tom may not be able to afford certain things, such as expensive food items like beef. This is a plausible answer as it is a common example of how poverty can affect one's ability to access basic necessities. On the other hand, buying cleanser essence for treatment may not be a direct result of being poor and may require more context to be a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jim put some water in the beaker and left them on the table for a long time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found the water became sweeter. (B) He found the volume of water decreased.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He found the volume of water decreased.\n\nExplanation: When water is left out for a long time, it can evaporate, which means it turns into water vapor and escapes into the air. This causes the volume of water to decrease. There is no scientific reason for the water to become sweeter just by being left out on a table. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He raises a lot of lambs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's family grows a lot of grapevines. (B) Tom opened a sweater factory.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom's family grows a lot of grapevines.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's family is involved in agriculture and specifically grows grapevines, which may provide a suitable environment for raising lambs. On the other hand, opening a sweater factory has no direct connection to raising lambs."}}
{"Q": "Designers desire to increase availability. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Designers bought a new clover. (B) Productivity was increased.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Productivity was increased.\nExplanation: Designers cannot increase availability by buying a new clover as it is not related to their work. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that productivity was increased as designers may have implemented new strategies or technologies to improve their workflow and increase the availability of their products or services."}}
{"Q": "Tom intakes weak type iii collagen by eating muscles. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One of Tom's llimbs had stong Muscles. (B) Muscles contain plenty of fibroblasts.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Muscles contain plenty of fibroblasts.\nExplanation: Type III collagen is mainly found in tissues that require elasticity and flexibility, such as muscles, blood vessels, and skin. Fibroblasts are the cells responsible for producing collagen in the body. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom intakes weak type III collagen by eating muscles, which contain plenty of fibroblasts that produce this type of collagen. Option A, which suggests that one of Tom's limbs had strong muscles, does not provide a clear explanation for why he would be intaking weak type III collagen."}}
{"Q": "Socrates is a philosopher and a great man. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Socrates dies for his value and belief. (B) Many readers thus consider him an excellent philosopher.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Socrates was sentenced to death by drinking hemlock for his philosophical beliefs and teachings. He refused to renounce his ideas and chose to die rather than compromise his principles. This event has become a defining moment in the history of philosophy and has cemented Socrates' legacy as a great thinker and martyr for his beliefs. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The attendants ends their relationships. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The meeting ends. (B) Lucy and Tom are not ready for the coming of a baby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Lucy and Tom are not ready for the coming of a baby.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the attendants' relationship ending. If Lucy and Tom are not ready for a baby, it could cause stress and strain on their relationship, leading to a breakup. On the other hand, the meeting ending would not necessarily have a direct impact on their relationship."}}
{"Q": "He bought a lot of berries. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor advised him to eat more fruits containing potassium. (B) Tom wants to eat some fruits with starch.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The doctor advising him to eat more fruits containing potassium is a more plausible reason for buying a lot of berries than Tom wanting to eat fruits with starch. Berries are known to be a good source of potassium, which is essential for maintaining healthy blood pressure and heart function. Therefore, it is more likely that the man bought a lot of berries to follow the doctor's advice and improve his health. On the other hand, there is no evidence to suggest that Tom specifically wanted to eat fruits with starch, making option B less plausible."}}
{"Q": "There is an apple on the ground. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sloth bent his hands and picked up the apple. (B) The exposed part of the apple turned yellow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The exposed part of the apple turned yellow.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the apple underwent a natural process of ripening, where the exposed part of the apple turned yellow due to oxidation, rather than a sloth picking it up."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has been injected with the pseudoephedrine. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her baby in the belly was checked with pseudoephedrine. (B) Her self-esteem is profoundly impacted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant commonly used to relieve nasal congestion caused by allergies, colds, or flu. It is not known to have any impact on self-esteem. However, if Lucy is pregnant, the pseudoephedrine may cross the placenta and affect her developing baby. Therefore, it is important to avoid using pseudoephedrine during pregnancy unless prescribed by a doctor."}}
{"Q": "Finally he decided to choose iridium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He needed a hard brittle lustrous dense transition metal of the platinum family. (B) Qualcomm Company has applied for many patents.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the person needed a hard, brittle, lustrous, dense transition metal of the platinum family. Iridium is a transition metal of the platinum family that possesses these characteristics, making it a suitable choice for the person. Option B is not related to the sentence and is therefore an irrelevant choice."}}
{"Q": "An argali appeared in front of the hunter. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hunter followed it to find more of them. (B) Her eyes accomodated to the new distance to the object.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Her eyes accommodated to the new distance to the object.\nExplanation: When an object suddenly appears in front of us, our eyes need to adjust to the new distance in order to see it clearly. This process is called accommodation. It is unlikely that the hunter would immediately follow the argali without assessing the situation and planning their next move. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack sat on the wheelchair instead of lying on the bed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He escaped from confinement to the bed. (B) Jack fell down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He escaped from confinement to the bed.\nExplanation: Since Jack sat on the wheelchair instead of lying on the bed, it can be inferred that he was able to move himself onto the wheelchair. This means that he was no longer confined to the bed and had the ability to move around. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is unlikely as there is no indication that Jack fell down."}}
{"Q": "Raspberries can be seen here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are aralias in this forest. (B) This garden contains all plants of rose family.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Raspberries belong to the rose family, so it is more plausible that they are present in a garden that contains all plants of the rose family rather than being in a forest with aralias."}}
{"Q": "I desired to make a difference in our class. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He eats a lot of eggplants. (B) I had ambitions in class.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If someone desires to make a difference in their class, it means they have ambitions and goals to improve the class in some way. This could involve participating more in class discussions, organizing study groups, or taking on leadership roles. Option A, about eating eggplants, is completely unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The doctor asks Rose to discontinuate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The nurse asked the doctor for barbiturates. (B) Rose is trying ovulate to get pregnant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Rose is trying ovulate to get pregnant.\nExplanation: The doctor may have asked Rose to discontinue a certain medication or treatment because it could interfere with her ovulation process. If Rose is trying to get pregnant, it is important for her to have a regular menstrual cycle and ovulation. Certain medications or treatments can disrupt this process, so the doctor may have advised her to discontinue them in order to increase her chances of conceiving. On the other hand, choice (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any reason for the doctor to ask Rose to discontinue a medication or treatment."}}
{"Q": "They set a herd of turtles free on the beach. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The turtles ran out to sea. (B) The turtles died on the beach.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The turtles ran out to sea.\nExplanation: Turtles are aquatic animals and their natural habitat is the ocean. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would instinctively head towards the water when released on the beach. It is unlikely that they would die on the beach unless there were other factors such as extreme weather conditions or predators."}}
{"Q": "He knew there was more in it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John found lice in his hair. (B) Edward walked on the road and was hit by a small stone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The cause of him knowing there was more in it is not related to finding lice in his hair. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Edward experienced something that made him realize there was more to the situation. Being hit by a small stone could have caused him to investigate further or become more aware of his surroundings. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This experiment requires an extremely inert chemical resisting even the action of aqua regia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher provided them with iridium. (B) The scientific community calls this effect hazards.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The teacher provided them with iridium.\nExplanation: Iridium is a chemical element that is extremely inert and can resist even the action of aqua regia, which is a highly corrosive mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. Therefore, it is a suitable chemical for experiments that require high chemical stability and resistance to corrosion. The teacher may have provided the students with iridium to conduct their experiment successfully. Option B is not a plausible answer as the term \"hazards\" does not relate to the given context."}}
{"Q": "These hyacinths are making their nests. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have found a new land. (B) They are enlarging holes in trees.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They are enlarging holes in trees.\nExplanation: Hyacinths are parrots that are known to nest in tree cavities. Therefore, it is more plausible that they are enlarging holes in trees to make their nests rather than finding a new land."}}
{"Q": "They perched on the tree ahead. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A flock of cuckoos flew in the distance. (B) The villagers started from the easiest fruit trees to grow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The villagers started from the easiest fruit trees to grow.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the birds perched on the tree because it was a fruit tree that the villagers had already harvested from. Birds often perch on fruit trees to eat the fruit or to rest after eating. On the other hand, option A is less likely because cuckoos are not known to perch on trees in large flocks, and it is unlikely that their presence in the distance would cause other birds to perch on a nearby tree."}}
{"Q": "NO mass were measured in the two bodies. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The inner ceramic magnets were out. (B) There is no grativity then.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There is no gravity then.\nExplanation: If no mass was measured in the two bodies, it means that they have no gravitational attraction towards each other. This is because gravity is a force that depends on the mass of the objects involved. Therefore, if there is no mass, there is no gravity. Option (A) is not a plausible answer because the absence of mass in the bodies would not affect the presence of the inner ceramic magnets."}}
{"Q": "Mike wanted to take some pictures of the jackrabbits. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The most impressed was the beautiful but different heads they have. (B) Mike waited under a mix of shrubs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Mike waited under a mix of shrubs.\nExplanation: The question states that Mike wanted to take pictures of jackrabbits, so it is likely that he would have waited in a location where he could observe and photograph them. Option A talks about the appearance of the jackrabbits' heads, but it does not mention anything about Mike's actions or the outcome of his attempt to take pictures. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is allergic to beef. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The examination showed that he had taken a large amount of ephedrine. (B) Tom never eats burgers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom never eats burgers.\nExplanation: Since Tom is allergic to beef, it is plausible that he avoids eating burgers or any other beef products to prevent an allergic reaction. Option A, which suggests that Tom had taken a large amount of ephedrine, is not related to his beef allergy and seems unlikely to be a result of it."}}
{"Q": "The economic fluctuation was rising. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The enemies were so strong. (B) More and more people made contributions in the development of economy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of economic fluctuation rising is more likely due to more and more people making contributions in the development of the economy. This could include factors such as increased investment, technological advancements, and a growing workforce. The strength of enemies is not typically a major factor in economic fluctuations."}}
{"Q": "They went to the church for prays. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The patients was in the process of the treatment. (B) Villagers suffered painful life when there was a heavy flood in the village.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the villagers went to the church for prayers because they were suffering from the aftermath of a heavy flood in the village. Going to the church for prayers during a difficult time is a common practice in many cultures and religions. On the other hand, there is no clear connection between going to the church for prayers and the patients being in the process of treatment."}}
{"Q": "Tom hated his neighbor for a long time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The jeweler wanted to sell Tom. (B) He beat up his neighbor violently.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He beat up his neighbor violently.\nExplanation: Holding a grudge against someone for a long time can lead to negative emotions and actions. In this case, Tom's hatred towards his neighbor may have built up to the point where he acted out violently towards them. While it is not a desirable outcome, it is a more plausible option than the jeweler wanting to sell Tom, which does not make sense in the given context."}}
{"Q": "Adequate nutrients were provided for his body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fat in his body has decreased. (B) The synthesis processes were normal in his body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The synthesis processes were normal in his body.\nExplanation: When adequate nutrients are provided to the body, it can carry out its normal metabolic processes, including the synthesis of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. This ensures that the body is functioning optimally and can maintain its overall health. While it is possible that the fat in the body may decrease if a person is in a caloric deficit, this cannot be assumed solely based on the provision of adequate nutrients. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is not very clear about one point in class. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He turned to the assistants for explaination. (B) Tom's teacher ask him to reread the textbook.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He turned to the assistants for explanation.\n\nExplanation: When someone is not clear about a point in class, the most plausible action would be to seek clarification from someone who can provide it. In this case, the assistants are likely to be knowledgeable and available to help Tom understand the point he is struggling with. It is less likely that the teacher would ask Tom to reread the textbook without first addressing his confusion and providing additional support. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lucy is a secretary of the chairman of the famous factory. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She enjoys the right of having a rest at weekends. (B) There is no doubt that he loves her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She enjoys the right of having a rest at weekends.\nExplanation: As a secretary of the chairman of a famous factory, Lucy is likely to have a stable job with a good salary and benefits. It is common for employees in such positions to have weekends off as part of their employment contract. Therefore, it is plausible that Lucy enjoys the right of having a rest at weekends. On the other hand, there is no information provided in the question to suggest that the chairman loves Lucy, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She went to the zoo. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sheep still need to be outdoors in winter. (B) Mary wanted to see giraffes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Mary wanted to see giraffes, as going to the zoo is a common activity for people who want to see animals. Option A about sheep needing to be outdoors in winter is not relevant to the question and seems like an unlikely reason for someone to go to the zoo."}}
{"Q": "The boss wants the building to be more stable. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He took use of slabs. (B) He chose a place with adequate sunlight and good air circulation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He took use of slabs.\nExplanation: Using slabs is a common method to increase the stability of a building. Slabs are large, flat pieces of concrete or other materials that are placed on top of the foundation to distribute the weight of the building more evenly. This helps to prevent the building from shifting or settling over time, which can cause structural damage and compromise its stability. Choosing a place with adequate sunlight and good air circulation may be important for other reasons, such as improving the comfort and health of the occupants, but it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stability of the building."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a student majoring in the paleozoology. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He mainly studies about fossil remains of animals. (B) He used a telescope to look at the moons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Paleozoology is the study of animal life during the Paleozoic era, which is characterized by the emergence of many animal groups and the development of hard body parts that can be preserved as fossils. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom mainly studies about fossil remains of animals rather than using a telescope to look at the moons, which is not related to his field of study."}}
{"Q": "Tom was bitten by a viper in the wild. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The venom gradually spreads in Tom's body. (B) Tom had edema and erythema on his arm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The venom gradually spreads in Tom's body.\nExplanation: When bitten by a viper, the venom can quickly spread through the bloodstream and affect various organs and systems in the body. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, difficulty breathing, and even paralysis. Without prompt medical attention, the venom can be fatal. Therefore, it is important to seek immediate medical attention if bitten by a viper. While edema and erythema may also occur, the gradual spread of venom throughout the body is a more plausible and serious consequence of a viper bite."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to be the winner in the Olympic Games. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was injected with some depressants. (B) He is not restricted in his exercise.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He is not restricted in his exercise.\nExplanation: In order to become a winner in the Olympic Games, Tom would need to train and exercise regularly. Being injected with depressants would have the opposite effect and hinder his performance. Therefore, it is more plausible that he is not restricted in his exercise and is able to train to his full potential."}}
{"Q": "He finally has something wrong with his airway. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's bone behind the toe was protruding. (B) Tom took no medicine to cure his fever.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom took no medicine to cure his fever.\nExplanation: If Tom had a fever, it is possible that he had an upper respiratory infection, which could have caused inflammation and swelling in his airway. If left untreated, this could lead to a more serious condition such as bronchitis or pneumonia, which could further compromise his airway. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's failure to take medicine to cure his fever led to his airway problems."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has taken a lot of antidepressants. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She found trazodone is the most effective one. (B) Their children are all over the country.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She found trazodone is the most effective one.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Lucy has taken a lot of antidepressants, which implies that she has been trying different medications to treat her depression. Therefore, it is more plausible that she found trazodone to be the most effective one rather than her children being all over the country, which is unrelated to the information given in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Rum's car was damaged. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rum changed to a new car. (B) Rum's repairman said it was a normal usage loss.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Rum's repairman said it was a normal usage loss.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Rum took the damaged car to a repairman who assessed the damage and determined that it was a result of normal wear and tear rather than an accident or other incident. It is less likely that Rum would immediately switch to a new car without attempting to repair the damage first."}}
{"Q": "Zooplankton disappears. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It hasn't rained here for a long time in this region. (B) Tom puts the zooplankton into the big fish tank with small fish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because putting zooplankton into a fish tank with small fish would likely result in the fish eating the zooplankton, causing it to disappear. Lack of rain (choice A) may affect the water level or quality, but it is unlikely to directly cause the disappearance of zooplankton."}}
{"Q": "Biologists had observed many mammals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They found that they visited families. (B) Biologists find that there are more gibbons in resource-rich places.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Biologists find that there are more gibbons in resource-rich places.\n\nExplanation: Based on the given information, it is more plausible that biologists observed the distribution of gibbons in different habitats and found that they are more abundant in resource-rich places. This observation could be a result of the fact that gibbons, like many other mammals, require access to food, water, and shelter to survive and reproduce. Therefore, they are more likely to be found in areas where these resources are abundant and readily available. On the other hand, choice A, which suggests that biologists found that mammals visit families, is not supported by the given information and seems less relevant to the study of mammal biology."}}
{"Q": "She used the teeth of it to clear up her hair. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She bought a comb. (B) The little kangaroo feels very cold.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She bought a comb.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"she used the teeth of it to clear up her hair.\" The word \"it\" refers to the comb, which implies that she had purchased a comb to use for her hair. Option B, \"The little kangaroo feels very cold,\" is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide a plausible explanation for why she used a comb on her hair."}}
{"Q": "Fear clutches at his heart. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom knows he's dying. (B) Bob's mentality has changed a lot recently.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom knows he's dying.\nExplanation: The phrase \"fear clutches at his heart\" suggests a strong and sudden feeling of fear. Knowing that one is dying is a common cause of such fear, as it is a significant and life-changing event. On the other hand, the second option, \"Bob's mentality has changed a lot recently,\" does not necessarily imply a sudden and intense feeling of fear."}}
{"Q": "The walruses were locked in an artifitial river together. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They degenerated in this way. (B) The diver observed ther conatct under water sometimes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They degenerated in this way.\nExplanation: Keeping walruses in an artificial river is not a natural environment for them. They require a large space to swim and dive, and being confined to an artificial river can cause physical and mental stress. This can lead to a decline in their health and well-being, resulting in degeneration. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B is unlikely as it does not explain the impact of being locked in an artificial river on the walruses."}}
{"Q": "Edison invented the light bulb with tungsten wire. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Edison was a foreigner. (B) Edison ruled out all kinds of unsuitable materials.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Edison ruled out all kinds of unsuitable materials.\nExplanation: Edison experimented with various materials for the filament of the light bulb, including platinum, carbon, and bamboo. However, these materials were either too expensive, burned out too quickly, or did not produce enough light. After extensive testing, Edison finally settled on tungsten wire as the most suitable material for the filament due to its high melting point, durability, and ability to produce a bright light. Therefore, the cause of Edison's invention of the light bulb with tungsten wire was his process of ruling out all kinds of unsuitable materials."}}
{"Q": "Tom catches octopus by the sea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He failed because the octopus can always escape as fast as possible. (B) His leg was amputated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Octopuses are known for their ability to escape from predators and dangerous situations. It is unlikely that Tom would have his leg amputated as a result of catching an octopus, as long as he took proper precautions and did not put himself in harm's way. However, it is possible that he may have failed to catch the octopus due to its quick escape tactics."}}
{"Q": "Shoulder bones are connected together to maintain stability. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are arteries in the shoulders of the human body. (B) There are ligaments in the shoulders of the human body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. There are ligaments in the shoulders of the human body.\nExplanation: Ligaments are tough, fibrous tissues that connect bones to other bones, providing stability and support to joints. In the case of the shoulder, ligaments connect the bones of the shoulder girdle (clavicle, scapula, and humerus) to each other, helping to maintain stability and prevent dislocation. While there are arteries in the shoulders, they do not play a direct role in connecting the bones together."}}
{"Q": "He got pneumonia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He died of it. (B) He nearly died of oxygen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He nearly died of oxygen.\nExplanation: While pneumonia can be a serious illness, it is not always fatal. However, it can cause difficulty breathing and a decrease in oxygen levels in the body. This can lead to a condition called hypoxia, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person nearly died of oxygen deprivation rather than dying directly from pneumonia."}}
{"Q": "They spent a long time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was going out for a date with his girlfriend at five in the evening on Christmas day. (B) This group of Pythons began to travel for their immigrant destination.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. This group of Pythons began to travel for their immigrant destination.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests a reason for the group spending a long time, which is the process of traveling to their immigrant destination. On the other hand, option A only mentions Tom going out for a date with his girlfriend, which does not necessarily explain why the group spent a long time."}}
{"Q": "The farmer grows celeries. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He knows its property very well. (B) He got carrots this year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He knows its property very well.\nExplanation: Growing celeries would require the farmer to have knowledge about the plant's growth requirements, soil type, and other factors that affect its growth. Therefore, it is more plausible that the farmer gained knowledge about the properties of celeries rather than getting carrots as a result of growing them."}}
{"Q": "When it was over, the water was still clear. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy rotated the tap. (B) The keeper bathed the gerbil in water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The keeper bathed the gerbil in water.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that something happened in the water, but it remained clear. If Lucy had rotated the tap, it would have caused some disturbance in the water, resulting in it becoming cloudy or murky. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that the keeper bathed the gerbil in water, which did not cause any disturbance in the water and left it clear."}}
{"Q": "He stole their preys before they came back. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hungry theif came to a village of fishers. (B) The hungry theif came to a forest of snakes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The hungry thief came to a village of fishers.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the fact that the thief stole their preys. If the thief came to a forest of snakes, it is unlikely that the snakes would have preys that the thief could steal. On the other hand, if the thief came to a village of fishers, it is more likely that the fishers had preys that the thief could steal. Therefore, option A is a more logical explanation for the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "A leopard fur garment needs to sacrifice countless leopards. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bought a lot of cocoa beans. (B) Environmental experts call for a ban on leopard fur.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Environmental experts call for a ban on leopard fur.\nExplanation: The use of leopard fur in garments requires the killing of numerous leopards, which can lead to a decline in their population and endangerment of the species. As a result, environmental experts may call for a ban on the use of leopard fur to protect the species and prevent further harm to the environment. Buying cocoa beans is not related to the issue of leopard fur garments."}}
{"Q": "Amy wants to wash the car with water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The butcher needs to wash them away with a lot of water. (B) She brings a long hose.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She brings a long hose.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if Amy wants to wash the car with water, it makes sense that she would bring a long hose to reach all parts of the car. Choice A doesn't make sense in this context as it mentions a butcher needing to wash something away with water, which is unrelated to the scenario of washing a car."}}
{"Q": "The interfaces of biological systems were destroyed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Part of the nutrients in the patient's body were depleted. (B) The alien's destruction plan starts from the essential structures in biological systems.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The alien's destruction plan starts from the essential structures in biological systems.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the destruction of the interfaces of biological systems was caused by an external factor, such as an alien attack, rather than a depletion of nutrients within the patient's body. Additionally, the fact that the interfaces were specifically targeted suggests a deliberate plan of destruction, rather than a natural occurrence."}}
{"Q": "Only Tom attributed all to lumber. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is the only one who considered the free existence of things. (B) He got some alloys.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He is the only one who considered the free existence of things.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that Tom had a unique perspective or belief about the source or value of things, attributing everything to lumber. This suggests that he saw the world in a different way than others, perhaps recognizing the importance of natural resources or the interconnectedness of all things. The statement does not mention anything about alloys, so option B is not relevant. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They firstly measured the covering area of the sun. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The scientists made observations of the sunspots. (B) Scientists wants to measure the illuminance of the sun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The scientists made observations of the sunspots.\nExplanation: Sunspots are dark areas on the surface of the sun that are cooler than the surrounding areas. By measuring the covering area of the sunspots, scientists can learn more about the sun's magnetic field and how it affects the sun's activity, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Therefore, it is more plausible that the scientists measured the covering area of the sun to study the sunspots rather than to measure the illuminance of the sun."}}
{"Q": "People are afraid of snakes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Frank is fond of chewing gum and eating hard and cold things. (B) Snakes are poisonous.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The fear of snakes is primarily due to their venomous nature. Many species of snakes are capable of delivering a deadly bite, which has led to a natural fear and avoidance of these creatures. Additionally, snakes have a unique appearance and movement that can be unsettling to some people. This fear may also be reinforced by cultural and societal beliefs about snakes as dangerous or evil creatures."}}
{"Q": "The astronomer calculated the size of such a Planetesimal. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His result could be compared with the size of small moons. (B) He discovered the new world.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His result could be compared with the size of small moons.\nExplanation: When an astronomer calculates the size of a planetesimal, they are determining the approximate size of a small celestial body that could have formed a planet. This information can then be compared to the size of small moons in our solar system to gain a better understanding of the potential size and composition of the planetesimal. It is unlikely that the astronomer would discover a new world solely based on the size calculation of a planetesimal."}}
{"Q": "His lupus was cured. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom took some antimalarials. (B) His vertebrate was damaged.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom took some antimalarials.\nExplanation: Antimalarials are known to be effective in treating lupus, as they can reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. While there is no known cure for lupus, antimalarials can help manage symptoms and prevent flare-ups. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's lupus was cured due to the antimalarials he took rather than his vertebrate being damaged, which is not a known cause or treatment for lupus."}}
{"Q": "The table looked more transparent. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The maker maintained the rate of Transparency of the table's suface. (B) The maker changed the rate of Transparency of the table's suface.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The maker changed the rate of Transparency of the table's surface.\n\nExplanation: If the table looked more transparent, it means that the rate of transparency of its surface increased. This could have been achieved by changing the material or finish of the table's surface, or by applying a treatment to make it more transparent. Option (A) suggests that the maker maintained the rate of transparency, which would not explain the observed change in the table's appearance. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "These gooseberries grow better. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gigi has cultivated gooseberries under good conditions. (B) I have some seedlings in my garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the gooseberries grew better, indicating that they were cultivated under favorable conditions. Option A states that Gigi has cultivated the gooseberries under good conditions, which is a plausible explanation for their better growth. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide any information about the conditions under which the seedlings were grown, making it less likely to be the cause of the better growth."}}
{"Q": "The movie star asked for assistance. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His company gave him a hand. (B) He asked for help from a 3 year old child.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: His company gave him a hand.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a movie star would ask for assistance from his company, which could provide him with resources and support, rather than asking for help from a 3 year old child who may not have the ability to assist him in any meaningful way."}}
{"Q": "There are a lot of creatures in the nature. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) All these creatures make up the biodiversity. (B) They play their own functions and keep the biological sphere.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. All these creatures make up the biodiversity.\nExplanation: Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms on Earth, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. The presence of a large number of different species in nature is what makes up the biodiversity. Each species has its own unique characteristics and plays a specific role in the ecosystem. For example, some species are pollinators, while others are decomposers. Biodiversity is important because it helps to maintain the balance of the ecosystem and provides various benefits to humans, such as food, medicine, and recreation. Therefore, it is more plausible to say that all these creatures make up the biodiversity."}}
{"Q": "Bobbies were in trap. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The angel gave him a hand. (B) The farmer bought pesticides to kill them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The angel gave him a hand.\nExplanation: Since bobbies are a type of bird, it is more plausible that an angel would come to their aid rather than a farmer buying pesticides to kill them. Additionally, the phrase \"in trap\" suggests that the bobbies were caught or stuck somewhere, making it more likely that they needed help getting out rather than being intentionally targeted for extermination."}}
{"Q": "Lisa's battery capacity is too small. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Father does some activations on her battery. (B) Lisa was diagnosed with diabetes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Lisa's battery capacity is too small, it means that her device is not holding a charge for a long enough period of time. This is a technical issue that can be resolved by activating or replacing the battery. Lisa being diagnosed with diabetes is not related to her device's battery capacity."}}
{"Q": "A bat entered our theater. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It hanged on the wall. (B) It hanged on the floor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It hanged on the wall.\nExplanation: Bats are known to roost or hang upside down from ceilings or walls. It is unlikely for a bat to hang on the floor as it would make it vulnerable to predators and unable to take off for flight. Therefore, it is more plausible that the bat entered the theater and found a spot to hang on the wall."}}
{"Q": "Tom lacks magnesium in his body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was diagnosed with the cardiovascular disease. (B) His doctor gave him ibuprofen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was diagnosed with the cardiovascular disease.\nExplanation: Magnesium deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's lack of magnesium led to a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease rather than his doctor prescribing him ibuprofen, which is a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory drug."}}
{"Q": "They easily damage their spines. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dachshunds have short backs. (B) Dachshunds have long backs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Dachshunds have short backs.\nExplanation: Dachshunds are known for their short legs and long bodies, which puts a lot of strain on their spines. This makes them more prone to spinal injuries and back problems, such as intervertebral disc disease. Therefore, it is more plausible that their short backs are the cause of their spinal issues rather than having long backs."}}
{"Q": "The students found some bone-like structures in the polyps. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They built nests with the materials they found. (B) The teacher told them it was called the spicules.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The teacher told them it was called the spicules.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the teacher would provide an explanation for the bone-like structures rather than the students building nests with them. The term \"spicules\" is commonly used to describe the small, needle-like structures found in some polyps, so it is plausible that the teacher would use this term to explain the discovery to the students."}}
{"Q": "The child was admitted to the hospital because he drank gasoline by mistake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Doctors feel thorny in detoxifying marijuana. (B) Doctors feel thorny in detoxifying mixed chemicals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Doctors feel thorny in detoxifying mixed chemicals.\nExplanation: Gasoline is a mixture of various chemicals, including benzene, toluene, and xylene, which are toxic and can cause serious health problems if ingested. Therefore, when a child drinks gasoline by mistake, it can lead to poisoning, which requires immediate medical attention. Doctors may have to use various methods to detoxify the mixed chemicals in gasoline, such as administering activated charcoal, inducing vomiting, or performing gastric lavage. Hence, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not relevant to the given scenario as it talks about detoxifying marijuana, which is not related to gasoline poisoning."}}
{"Q": "He died soon after. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kimi was wounded by the enemy. (B) He took opium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The fact that he \"took opium\" suggests that he died from an overdose or other negative effects of the drug. On the other hand, there is no indication that he was wounded by the enemy, so option A is less likely."}}
{"Q": "Tom can't master division. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His mother is angry at his not mastering fundamental operation of arithmetic. (B) He could design one of minimalism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: If Tom can't master division, it is likely that he is struggling with his math skills. As a result, his mother may be frustrated or disappointed that he is not able to grasp such a fundamental concept in arithmetic. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to Tom's math skills and seems like an unlikely outcome of his struggles with division."}}
{"Q": "There was a swan in the office. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The official got the beautiful feather. (B) The poor actress can not hear anything because of the noise.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The official got the beautiful feather.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the swan was captured and its feather was taken by the official as a souvenir or decoration. The presence of a swan in an office would not necessarily cause enough noise to affect an actress's hearing."}}
{"Q": "Tom saw himself in the mirror. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has put a mirror under the sun. (B) Baby Tom looked into the mirror.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom looked into the mirror himself rather than putting a mirror under the sun, which would not necessarily result in him seeing his reflection. Additionally, the use of \"himself\" in the sentence suggests that Tom was the one actively looking into the mirror. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause of Tom seeing himself in the mirror."}}
{"Q": "The coin is attracted by the magnet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack holds the iron sheet close to the magnetite. (B) Jane held the magnet close to the coin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because magnets have a magnetic field that can attract certain materials, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt. Since coins are typically made of metal, they can be attracted to magnets. Therefore, it is more likely that Jane held the magnet close to the coin, causing it to be attracted to the magnet. Option A, on the other hand, does not provide a clear explanation of how the coin was attracted to the magnet."}}
{"Q": "He went to church to be baptized. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack wants to join Christianity. (B) Another case of sudden death occurred.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jack wants to join Christianity.\nExplanation: The act of baptism is a common practice in Christianity, where a person is immersed in water or has water poured over them as a symbol of their faith and commitment to the religion. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack went to church to be baptized because he wants to join Christianity rather than because of another sudden death occurring."}}
{"Q": "We were killed by nuclear weapons. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Missles were used to attack us. (B) The decay of uranium didn't stop.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The use of missiles to attack with nuclear weapons is a more plausible explanation for being killed by nuclear weapons. Uranium decay alone would not cause a nuclear explosion, it requires a specific process and technology to create a nuclear weapon."}}
{"Q": "They found that they can grow to eight inches long. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They studied the components of poinsettias. (B) They studied the features of leech.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"they\" can grow to eight inches long, which implies that the subject being referred to is some kind of organism. The only option that involves studying the features of an organism is (B), which mentions leeches. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the growth is related to the study of leeches rather than the components of poinsettias."}}
{"Q": "The staff in this hotel are well-trained in this hotel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They can offer the guests with good service. (B) Many workers are toxicated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They can offer the guests with good service.\nExplanation: If the staff in a hotel are well-trained, it means they have received proper training and are equipped with the necessary skills to provide good service to the guests. This will result in a positive experience for the guests and increase the likelihood of them returning to the hotel in the future. On the other hand, if many workers were intoxicated, it would have a negative impact on the hotel's reputation and the quality of service provided to guests. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mike prepared enough proteins for them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mike kept several poodles. (B) They are getting married today.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They are getting married today.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Mike prepared enough proteins for a special occasion like a wedding rather than keeping several poodles, which is unrelated to the situation."}}
{"Q": "They learn a lot from each other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom and Maria are good friends. (B) The teacher provided them with a variety of pedons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom and Maria are good friends.\nExplanation: When people are good friends, they tend to share their knowledge and experiences with each other. This can lead to mutual learning and growth. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom and Maria learned a lot from each other because they are good friends, rather than because of the teacher providing them with a variety of pedons."}}
{"Q": "Tom was in poor health. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has burdens. (B) Tom had terrible acne these days.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has burdens.\nExplanation: Poor health is often caused by stress and anxiety, which can be caused by burdens such as financial problems, relationship issues, or work-related stress. Terrible acne may cause discomfort and affect one's self-esteem, but it is unlikely to cause poor overall health. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The tetrapods' tooth is romoved. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The tetrapod can't ea now. (B) It can get nourishment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It can get nourishment.\nExplanation: While teeth are important for chewing and breaking down food, they are not the only means of obtaining nourishment. Tetrapods can still eat and obtain nourishment through other means such as swallowing food whole or using their jaws to crush and grind food. Therefore, the removal of teeth would not necessarily prevent the tetrapod from getting nourishment."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to the eastern United States. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom had a visit of Indiana. (B) He saw a lot of dogwoods.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He saw a lot of dogwoods.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because dogwoods are a common tree in the eastern United States, particularly in states like Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Indiana is also in the eastern United States, but it is not necessarily a destination that someone would specifically visit unless they had a specific reason to do so. Therefore, it is more likely that Tom saw a lot of dogwoods during his trip to the eastern United States."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to his vegetable shed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He saw a lot of aphids. (B) Some people learned how to make beers with top fermenting yeasts from him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence only mentions Tom going to his vegetable shed, but does not provide any information about him teaching people how to make beer with top fermenting yeasts. On the other hand, the sentence implies that something happened to Tom when he went to his vegetable shed, and seeing a lot of aphids is a more plausible outcome."}}
{"Q": "He found something sticky and stick in the bottle. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has caught an aphid in the bottle. (B) Tom has just had a wine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has caught an aphid in the bottle.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the stickiness and stick found in the bottle was caused by an aphid caught inside, rather than Tom having just had a wine. Wine would not typically leave a sticky residue in a bottle, whereas an insect like an aphid could leave behind a sticky substance."}}
{"Q": "They found that they can grow to eight inches long. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They studied the features of leech. (B) Scientists conducted a series of experiments on truffles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Scientists conducted a series of experiments on truffles.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"they\" can grow to eight inches long, but it does not specify what \"they\" refers to. However, the fact that scientists conducted experiments on truffles suggests that \"they\" may also refer to truffles. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the growth was due to the experiments conducted on truffles rather than studying the features of leeches, which is not mentioned in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "They always stay in their home. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Leah has a cough and often feels like having mucus in her throat. (B) Donkeys are lazy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Leah has a cough and often feels like having mucus in her throat suggests that she may be ill or have a respiratory condition that makes it difficult for her to leave the house. This is a more plausible explanation than donkeys being lazy, which is not relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "He doesn't have enough melanocytes in his body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has no neural crest. (B) He has albinism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He has albinism.\nExplanation: Albinism is a genetic condition that affects the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. People with albinism have a reduced number of melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin, in their body. This results in a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, and an increased sensitivity to sunlight. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer than option (A), which suggests a complete absence of neural crest cells, a highly unlikely scenario as neural crest cells are essential for the development of many tissues and organs in the body."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a talent in running. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The result showed that it was the persistence of sound in an enclosed space caused by repeated reflections. (B) He always won in various running competitions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He always won in various running competitions.\nExplanation: Tom's talent in running would likely result in him performing well in running competitions. Winning various competitions would be a plausible outcome of his talent. Option (A) is unrelated to Tom's talent in running and seems to be describing an acoustic phenomenon."}}
{"Q": "He felt sad about his opprobrium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher's shameful action made him disgraceful. (B) He bitterly regretted that the man had robbed him of the chance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The teacher's shameful action made him disgraceful.\nExplanation: Opprobrium means public disgrace or shame. Therefore, it can be inferred that the cause of his sadness was the teacher's shameful action, which led to his own disgrace. Option B does not provide any context or explanation for the man who robbed him of a chance, making it less plausible."}}
{"Q": "He was so tired that he fell asleep. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was going out for a date with his girlfriend at five in the evening on Christmas day. (B) Tom spent the morning washing clothes and cleaning the room.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom spent the morning washing clothes and cleaning the room.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's tiredness was caused by his physical activity of washing clothes and cleaning the room, rather than going out for a date with his girlfriend later in the day. Physical activity can cause fatigue and exhaustion, leading to falling asleep."}}
{"Q": "The pincers scratched her finger. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor is going to give her fluids. (B) Melinda went down to the pond to catch crabs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Melinda went down to the pond to catch crabs.\nExplanation: The word \"pincers\" suggests that the scratch was caused by a crab, which is consistent with choice (B) where Melinda went down to the pond to catch crabs. Choice (A) about the doctor giving her fluids is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for the cause of the scratch."}}
{"Q": "Tom often faces the problem of anxiety. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom can't breathe normally. (B) It is a prominent natural state of  his nature.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom can't breathe normally.\nExplanation: Anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and hyperventilation. These symptoms can make it difficult for a person to breathe normally. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B is not a likely result of anxiety as anxiety is not a natural state of a person's nature, but rather a response to certain situations or triggers."}}
{"Q": "The residents here decided to migrate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The climate here became more and more severe. (B) The residents of this tropical town can't stand the wet weather.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The climate here became more and more severe.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the residents were forced to migrate due to worsening weather conditions. In contrast, option B seems less likely as tropical towns are typically known for their wet weather, and it is unlikely that the residents would suddenly become unable to tolerate it."}}
{"Q": "Tommy hopes that azaleas will thrive. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The gardener instructs him to transplant the flowers under the shade of the tree. (B) The gardener instructs him to transplant the flowers under the sun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The gardener instructs him to transplant the flowers under the shade of the tree.\n\nExplanation: Azaleas are shade-loving plants and thrive in areas with filtered sunlight or partial shade. Therefore, it is more plausible that the gardener would advise Tommy to transplant the flowers under the shade of the tree to ensure their growth and health. Transplanting them under the sun could cause the plants to wither and die due to excessive heat and sunlight."}}
{"Q": "He measured the diameter and bought a new  proper tyre. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike was not satisfied with the plasticine in a rim. (B) Tom's car tyre got punctured.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The fact that he measured the diameter and bought a new proper tyre suggests that there was a problem with the existing tyre. Option B, which states that Tom's car tyre got punctured, is a more plausible answer as a punctured tyre would need to be replaced with a new one of the correct size. Option A, which suggests that Mike was not satisfied with the plasticine in a rim, does not provide a clear reason for why he would need to measure the diameter and buy a new tyre."}}
{"Q": "He eats something containing peppermints. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's sphincters are extremely nervous. (B) He is sleepy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He is sleepy.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom ate something containing peppermints to help him stay awake or combat drowsiness, as peppermint is known to have a stimulating effect on the senses. On the other hand, sphincter nerves are not typically associated with peppermint consumption."}}
{"Q": "I cannot get connected to the internet at a high speed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This area is current-free. (B) Ethernet was interrupted on my computer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Ethernet was interrupted on my computer.\nExplanation: If the internet connection is slow, it is more likely that there is an interruption in the Ethernet connection on the computer. This can be caused by a faulty Ethernet cable, a loose connection, or a problem with the network adapter. On the other hand, if the area is current-free, it would mean that there is no power supply, which is not related to the internet speed. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They are classified in the low toxicity zone. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John went to the shop to pick up surfactants. (B) The scientist testing lipoproteins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The scientist testing lipoproteins.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that \"they\" (presumably referring to some chemicals or substances) are classified in the low toxicity zone. This classification is likely based on some sort of toxicity testing or evaluation. Since lipoproteins are being tested by a scientist, it is possible that the low toxicity classification is related to these lipoproteins or some other substance being tested by the scientist. On the other hand, there is no information provided about John going to the shop to pick up surfactants, so it is unlikely that this is the cause of the low toxicity classification."}}
{"Q": "Jack committed carjacking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This general intent crime analogous to robbery put him into jail. (B) Colleagues opened the window for him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This general intent crime analogous to robbery put him into jail.\nExplanation: Carjacking is a serious crime that involves the use of force or intimidation to steal a car from its owner. It is considered a general intent crime, which means that the perpetrator does not need to have a specific intent to commit the crime, but only needs to have the general intent to take the car. Carjacking is punishable by imprisonment, and therefore, it is likely that Jack was arrested and put into jail for committing this crime. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not make sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "Tom lacks ketones in his blood. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His blood flow is not as improved as others with normal ketones level. (B) His blood flow is as improved as others with normal ketones level.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: Ketones are produced by the liver when the body is in a state of ketosis, which occurs when there is a lack of glucose in the body. Ketones are used as an alternative source of energy for the body, particularly the brain, when glucose is not available. Therefore, if Tom lacks ketones in his blood, it suggests that his body is not in a state of ketosis and may not be efficiently using alternative sources of energy. This could potentially lead to decreased blood flow and other negative health effects. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Junipers grow everywhere in the village. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The village has a great production in vegetables. (B) It is well-drained in the village.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Junipers are known to thrive in well-drained soil and can tolerate dry conditions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the abundance of junipers in the village is due to the well-drained soil rather than the production of vegetables."}}
{"Q": "Susan took a glass of soda and put it on the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After a few days, the soda water lost its carbonation. (B) The carbonization of soda remains after a long time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The carbonization of soda remains after a long time.\n\nExplanation: Based on the information given in the question, there is no indication of how long the soda was left on the table. However, it is a well-known fact that carbonation in soda can last for a long time, especially if the container is sealed. Therefore, it is more plausible that the carbonization of the soda remained even after some time had passed. Option (A) is less likely as it suggests that the carbonation disappeared after only a few days, which is not typical for soda."}}
{"Q": "Tom's knee joints were hurt in a car accident. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor judged him to have a mild concussion. (B) He couldn't move his legs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He couldn't move his legs.\nExplanation: Knee joint injuries can cause difficulty in movement and mobility, but they do not typically affect the ability to move the legs entirely. A mild concussion is also unrelated to knee joint injuries. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I told him they could only measure wind speed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim recently bought a gyroscope. (B) I saw Jane use anemometers to test wind direction.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I saw Jane use anemometers to test wind direction.\nExplanation: Anemometers are instruments used to measure wind speed, while wind vanes or weather vanes are used to measure wind direction. Since the speaker saw Jane using anemometers to test wind direction, it is likely that they were using the wrong tool for the job, leading the speaker to correct them and state that anemometers can only measure wind speed. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He found a leech crawling up his leg. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom farted in class. (B) Kevin went swimming in a small river.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Kevin went swimming in a small river.\nExplanation: Leeches are commonly found in freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. They attach themselves to the skin of animals and humans to feed on their blood. Therefore, it is more plausible that Kevin picked up the leech while swimming in a small river rather than Tom farting in class causing a leech to crawl up his leg."}}
{"Q": "The customer were very satisfied. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The product has high utility. (B) The staff conveyed the new ideas they came up with to the customers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the customers were satisfied, which implies that they found the product useful. Therefore, option A, which states that the product has high utility, is a more plausible answer than option B, which talks about staff conveying new ideas. While staff communication may contribute to customer satisfaction, it is unlikely to be the sole cause of it."}}
{"Q": "He needs to know the degrees of arc. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John wanted to measure the declinatio. (B) John wants to measure the mention body temperature.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John wanted to measure the declination.\nExplanation: The degrees of arc are typically used to measure angles, including the declination of celestial bodies. Therefore, it is more plausible that John needed to measure the declination rather than the body temperature, which would not require the use of degrees of arc."}}
{"Q": "Anacondas opened their jaws extremely wide. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They went out to find food. (B) Anacondas swallowed their victims whole.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Anacondas swallowed their victims whole.\nExplanation: Anacondas are known for their ability to swallow prey whole, and their wide jaws allow them to do so. Opening their jaws wide is a necessary step in the process of swallowing their prey. Going out to find food is not necessarily a direct result of opening their jaws wide."}}
{"Q": "It results in particular problems in their minds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are learning the science of computation. (B) People's reading got fragmentation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. People's reading got fragmentation.\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that there are problems in the minds of people, and the cause of these problems is mentioned as \"fragmentation\" in their reading. This implies that people are having difficulty comprehending and retaining information due to fragmented reading habits. Option A, which mentions learning the science of computation, is not related to the context of the sentence and is therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Tom questioned various beliefs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy was invited to talk about her belief. (B) Tom believes in heresy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Tom questioning various beliefs was caused by Lucy being invited to talk about her belief. It is likely that Lucy's beliefs sparked Tom's curiosity and led him to question other beliefs as well. The option B, that Tom believes in heresy, is not a plausible answer as it assumes that Tom already had a set of beliefs that were considered heretical, which is not mentioned in the given information."}}
{"Q": "Tom has suffered from the disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) In the late period, sclerosis was manifested on Tom. (B) It's getting rotten.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. In the late period, sclerosis was manifested on Tom.\nExplanation: Sclerosis is a common symptom of many diseases, including multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis. It refers to the hardening of tissues due to the accumulation of scar tissue or other abnormal growths. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's disease led to sclerosis in the late period rather than it getting rotten."}}
{"Q": "Jack eats a lot of green vegetables. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He became healthier. (B) His digestion is very smooth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He became healthier.\nExplanation: Green vegetables are known to be rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which are essential for maintaining good health. By consuming a lot of green vegetables, Jack would have improved his overall health and well-being, as well as reducing the risk of various diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. While it is possible that his digestion may also have improved, the most plausible answer is that he became healthier overall."}}
{"Q": "John bought a thermometer and put it the room. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John wanted to monitor the temperature of the room where he planted mushrooms. (B) John wanted to keep the room where he planted mushroom moist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: John bought a thermometer to monitor the temperature of the room where he planted mushrooms. This is a more plausible answer because mushrooms require a specific temperature range to grow properly. By monitoring the temperature, John can ensure that the room is at the optimal temperature for mushroom growth. Keeping the room moist, as stated in option B, is also important for mushroom growth, but a thermometer would not be necessary for this purpose."}}
{"Q": "Alice's baby was always drinking a kind milk which consists of nitrates. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The baby was suffered the blue-baby syndrome. (B) Her baby was healthy when she grew up.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The baby suffered from the blue-baby syndrome.\nExplanation: The blue-baby syndrome is caused by the presence of nitrates in the body, which can interfere with the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen. This can lead to a bluish tint in the skin, lips, and nails, as well as breathing difficulties and other health problems. Therefore, it is more plausible that Alice's baby would suffer from the blue-baby syndrome if she was drinking milk containing nitrates."}}
{"Q": "He looked at trilobites. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found these leaves are slippery. (B) He saw spines on them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He saw spines on them.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the person looked at trilobites, which are extinct marine arthropods. There is no mention of leaves or slipperiness in the sentence, so option (A) can be ruled out. However, trilobites are known to have spines on their bodies, so it is plausible that the person saw these spines while looking at them. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was very drunk last night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom becomes more outgoing. (B) Tom is having a hangover.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom is having a hangover.\nExplanation: When someone drinks too much alcohol, they can experience a hangover the next day. Symptoms of a hangover include headache, nausea, fatigue, and sensitivity to light and sound. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom is experiencing a hangover rather than becoming more outgoing."}}
{"Q": "She knows its lineages. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lila loves classification of her things. (B) The old witch protects everything of  the tree of life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The old witch is likely the keeper of the tree of life and its lineages, and has shared this knowledge with Lila. It is unlikely that Lila's love of classification would lead her to specifically learn about the lineages of the tree of life."}}
{"Q": "The fish was captured by the peregrine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fish was caught by an otter. (B) Peregrine had an eye on a fish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Peregrine had an eye on a fish.\nExplanation: Peregrine is a bird of prey known for its exceptional hunting skills. It is highly likely that the peregrine spotted the fish and swooped down to capture it. Option (A) stating that the fish was caught by an otter is not relevant to the given information and seems unlikely as otters are not known to capture fish in mid-air. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I don't like the smell of onions. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I don't like the smell of scallions. (B) I never eat foods containing onions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I never eat foods containing onions.\nExplanation: If someone doesn't like the smell of onions, it is likely that they also don't enjoy the taste of onions. Therefore, it is plausible that they would avoid eating foods containing onions to avoid the unpleasant smell and taste. Choice (A) is less plausible because scallions are a type of onion and have a similar smell and taste, so it is unlikely that someone who dislikes the smell of onions would enjoy the smell of scallions."}}
{"Q": "The fungicides play out different levels of activity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Doctors use fungicides to counter the spread of cancer cells. (B) Doctors use fungicides to deal with different diseases.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Doctors use fungicides to deal with different diseases.\n\nExplanation: The level of activity of fungicides depends on the specific disease-causing fungi they are designed to target. Different fungi have different structures and mechanisms of action, so fungicides must be tailored to each specific type of fungus. Therefore, the cause of the varying levels of activity is the diversity of fungal diseases that fungicides are used to treat. Option A is not relevant to the question as it talks about the use of fungicides in cancer treatment, which is not related to the activity levels of fungicides."}}
{"Q": "The salt dissappeared. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom poured some salt in the sands. (B) Tom poured some salt in the water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom poured some salt in the water.\nExplanation: If Tom poured salt in the sands, it would still be visible and present. However, if he poured salt in the water, it would dissolve and become invisible, causing the salt to \"disappear.\" Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His father prevented him in time which saved a lot of food in another sense. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack ingested glycerin by mistake. (B) Tom carelessly seeded oats in the autumn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom carelessly seeded oats in the autumn.\nExplanation: If Tom carelessly seeded oats in the autumn, it could have led to a poor harvest or even no harvest at all. This would have resulted in a shortage of food. However, if Jack's father prevented him in time, it means that he was able to rectify the mistake and save the crop, thus saving a lot of food in another sense. On the other hand, ingesting glycerin by mistake would not have any direct impact on food supply."}}
{"Q": "His father organized the whole family to travel. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wants to see a lot of zebras. (B) Tom is busy with exams recently so he is very nervous.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Tom is busy with exams and is very nervous suggests that the family is traveling to help him relax and take a break from his studies. Option A, on the other hand, seems unlikely as it is not a strong enough reason to organize a whole family trip."}}
{"Q": "Tom has eaten something containing starches. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His blood sugar has risen. (B) He suffered from gastrointestinal trouble.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His blood sugar has risen.\nExplanation: Starches are complex carbohydrates that are broken down into glucose during digestion. Glucose is then absorbed into the bloodstream, causing an increase in blood sugar levels. This is a normal physiological response to consuming carbohydrates and is not typically associated with gastrointestinal trouble. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The government only protected the property of the rich and had no concern for the individual rights of ordinary people. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The people overthrew the government by election. (B) Laterly the residents felt the falling of drizzle.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The people overthrew the government by election.\nExplanation: When a government only protects the property of the rich and ignores the individual rights of ordinary people, it creates a sense of injustice and inequality among the population. This can lead to widespread dissatisfaction and unrest, which can ultimately result in the overthrow of the government through democratic means such as elections. This has happened in many countries throughout history, where governments that fail to address the needs and concerns of their citizens have been voted out of power. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B is not related to the question and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The family provided a bed for their pet dog. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The dog can insulate itself from the cold ground. (B) The puppy grows up happily under careful care.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The dog can insulate itself from the cold ground.\nExplanation: Providing a bed for the pet dog allows it to have a comfortable and warm place to sleep, which helps to insulate it from the cold ground. This can be especially important during colder months or in areas with colder climates. While providing a bed may also contribute to the puppy's happiness and well-being, the insulation benefits are a more direct and likely result of this action."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes eating a lot of turnips. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His child is also good at learning English. (B) He was filled with vitamins.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Eating a lot of turnips would result in Tom being filled with vitamins. Turnips are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. Consuming turnips regularly can help improve overall health and boost the immune system. However, there is no direct correlation between Tom's love for turnips and his child's English proficiency."}}
{"Q": "Their enemies' signal disturbed radio frequency waves. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Our ground penetrating radar detected subsurface features as usual. (B) Our ground penetrating radar failed to detect subsurface features.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Our ground penetrating radar failed to detect subsurface features.\nExplanation: The disturbance of radio frequency waves caused by the enemies' signal would likely interfere with the operation of our ground penetrating radar, which relies on radio waves to detect subsurface features. As a result, it is more plausible that the radar would fail to detect these features rather than continue to operate as usual."}}
{"Q": "I want to borrow some money. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I ran to buy unguent to treat white patches. (B) I turn to banks for help.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I turned to banks for help.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that someone who wants to borrow money would turn to banks for help rather than running to buy unguent to treat white patches, which is unrelated to borrowing money. Banks are known for providing loans and other financial assistance to individuals and businesses in need of funds."}}
{"Q": "Tom graduated from university. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom needs to choose working or going abroad. (B) He takes many part-time jobs every day to earn living expenses and tuition.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom needs to choose working or going abroad.\nExplanation: Graduating from university means that Tom has completed his education and is now ready to enter the workforce or pursue further studies. He may need to make a decision about whether to start working or continue his education by going abroad for higher studies. Option B is less likely as it suggests that Tom is struggling to make ends meet, which may not necessarily be the case after graduation."}}
{"Q": "This region is a habitat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many hummingbirds come here every year. (B) The owner planted some geraniums.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Many hummingbirds come here every year.\nExplanation: A habitat is a natural environment where a particular species of organism lives. Hummingbirds are known to be attracted to certain habitats, such as areas with flowers and nectar. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of this region being a habitat would be the presence of many hummingbirds, rather than the owner planting geraniums."}}
{"Q": "They disrupted homeostasis in its body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researchers fed the mice some capsicums. (B) The biologists disrupted the metabolic balance maintained by several processes in the mice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The biologists disrupted the metabolic balance maintained by several processes in the mice.\nExplanation: Homeostasis refers to the maintenance of a stable internal environment in an organism. Disrupting homeostasis can occur due to various factors, such as changes in temperature, pH, or metabolic processes. In this case, the disruption of homeostasis in the mice was caused by the biologists, who likely manipulated the metabolic processes in the mice, leading to an imbalance in their internal environment. Feeding the mice capsicums (choice A) may cause some physiological changes, but it is unlikely to disrupt homeostasis in the body. Therefore, choice B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes the smell of pure and fresh. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He enjoyed the smell of coconut. (B) He drinks a cup of tea every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He enjoyed the smell of coconut.\nExplanation: Since Tom likes the smell of pure and fresh, it is likely that he would enjoy the natural and refreshing scent of coconut. Drinking tea every day does not necessarily relate to his preference for a certain smell."}}
{"Q": "Mario's bronchioles are blocked by something peculiar. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His lobules lose function soon. (B) He usually suffers from arrhythmias.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His lobules lose function soon.\nExplanation: Bronchioles are small air passages in the lungs that lead to the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. If they become blocked, it can lead to a decrease in airflow and oxygen exchange, which can cause the lobules (small sections of the lungs) to lose function over time. This can lead to respiratory problems and potentially even lung damage if left untreated. Arrhythmias, on the other hand, are irregular heartbeats and are not directly related to bronchiole blockage."}}
{"Q": "The real story became a big screen adaptation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many audience commented on its dramatic effects. (B) More people in us were attracted by it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. More people in the US were attracted by it.\nExplanation: When a real story is adapted into a movie, it often attracts more attention from the audience. This is because movies have a wider reach and can be easily accessible to a larger audience. As a result, more people in the US were likely to be attracted to the movie adaptation of the real story. While some audience members may comment on the dramatic effects, the overall impact of the movie would likely be an increase in interest and attention towards the story."}}
{"Q": "She picks two the small flaps at the base of the leaf. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary grabbed a bunch of some kind of plant with foliage and asked what' s it. (B) Lucy wants to observe stipules.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lucy wants to observe stipules.\nExplanation: Stipules are small leaf-like structures that are found at the base of some leaves. By picking the small flaps at the base of the leaf, Lucy may be trying to observe the stipules more closely. This is a plausible explanation for her action. Option (A) is not relevant to the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "It's proved that sound can not transmitted in vacuum. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom did a lot of experiments. (B) A research team went to the Sahara desert to carry out scientific research.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that sound cannot be transmitted in a vacuum is a well-established scientific principle that has been proven through numerous experiments conducted by scientists over the years. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of this phenomenon is due to scientific research and experimentation, rather than a research team going to the Sahara desert."}}
{"Q": "Water was used as as a new source of electricity. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The night in the fall becomes longer. (B) This hydro-energetic power manifested its own drawbacks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: While water can be a renewable and clean source of energy, the construction of hydroelectric power plants can have negative impacts on the environment and local communities. Dams can disrupt natural river ecosystems and displace people living in the area. Additionally, the amount of electricity generated by hydroelectric power can be affected by changes in water levels due to droughts or other factors. Therefore, it is likely that the use of water as a new source of electricity would have some drawbacks, as stated in option B. Option A, on the other hand, is unrelated to the use of water as a source of electricity."}}
{"Q": "He had a reaction. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jerry was stimulated. (B) Billy heard that lily's rhizomes can be used as medicine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jerry was stimulated.\nExplanation: The word \"reaction\" implies that Jerry had some sort of physical or emotional response to something. Option A suggests that Jerry was stimulated, which could have caused a reaction. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to Jerry and does not provide a plausible explanation for his reaction. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "He often observed arthropods like insects. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was interested in Exoskeletons. (B) He is a biological scientist who specializes in the study of insects.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The fact that he often observed arthropods like insects suggests that he has a particular interest or expertise in this area. Option B states that he is a biological scientist who specializes in the study of insects, which is a more plausible explanation for his behavior than option A, which only mentions exoskeletons and does not provide a clear reason for his interest in arthropods."}}
{"Q": "The wolf was hunting the antelope. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The antelope asked help from his companions. (B) The large antlers are their powerful weapon.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the antelope would seek help from its companions when being hunted by a predator like a wolf. Antlers may be a powerful weapon, but they are not mentioned in the given sentence and may not necessarily be effective against a wolf."}}
{"Q": "Jerboas are hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They pick up food by their toes. (B) They have different access to food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They have different access to food.\nExplanation: When jerboas are hungry, they may have to compete for food resources. Depending on their location and environment, some jerboas may have easier access to food than others. For example, jerboas living in areas with more vegetation may have more food options than those living in more arid regions. Additionally, jerboas may have to adapt their foraging strategies to find food, such as using their toes to dig for roots or seeds. However, the idea that they exclusively pick up food by their toes is not entirely accurate, as they also use their mouths and front paws to gather food."}}
{"Q": "He often studies various phenomena in life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is a sociologist. (B) Tom wanted to consider biology as a subject.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom often studies various phenomena in life suggests that he has a general interest in understanding human behavior and social interactions, which are key topics in sociology. On the other hand, the statement does not provide any indication that Tom is specifically interested in biology, so option B is less likely to be the cause of his behavior."}}
{"Q": "Babes are enjoying sunshine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather is pleasant on the beachs. (B) The farmed managed to kill a lot chiggers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The weather is pleasant on the beachs.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the babes are enjoying sunshine, which implies that they are outside. The most plausible reason for them to be outside and enjoying the sunshine is that the weather is pleasant on the beach. Option B, which suggests that the farmed managed to kill a lot of chiggers, is not related to the statement and seems like an irrelevant and unlikely cause for the babes to be enjoying the sunshine."}}
{"Q": "He fastened his seat belt. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He swung his arms. (B) He was saved from being thrown out of the car in the car accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He was saved from being thrown out of the car in the car accident.\n\nExplanation: Fastening a seat belt is a safety measure that is designed to keep passengers secure in their seats during a car accident. In the event of a collision or sudden stop, the seat belt prevents the passenger from being thrown out of the car or hitting the dashboard or windshield. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of fastening his seat belt was that he was saved from being thrown out of the car in the car accident. Swinging his arms is not a direct result of fastening a seat belt."}}
{"Q": "Kittiwakes were hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are harmful. (B) They ate a lot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They ate a lot.\nExplanation: When animals are hungry, they tend to eat more to satisfy their hunger. Therefore, it is more plausible that the kittiwakes ate a lot when they were hungry. Option A, stating that they are harmful, does not logically follow from the given information."}}
{"Q": "They found out that it was written by the famous poet Shelley. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They read a very beautiful poem. (B) The student has looked up the book.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the student looked up the book and discovered that it was written by Shelley. Option A is not a likely cause as a beautiful poem does not necessarily indicate the author's identity."}}
{"Q": "His mother bought him a cygnet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Every day he catches aquatic insects to feed it. (B) He feeds it with plants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He feeds it with plants.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy would feed the cygnet with plants as they are a common food source for swans and their young. Catching aquatic insects may not be a sustainable or practical option for feeding the cygnet on a daily basis."}}
{"Q": "Tom goes out in a down jacket in summer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The carbon dioxide, one of the major greenhouse gases, content in the air decreases. (B) Tom is suffering from heat stroke.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom is suffering from heat stroke.\nExplanation: Wearing a down jacket in summer can cause the body to overheat, leading to heat stroke. It is not related to the carbon dioxide content in the air."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to a moor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People around him heard noise. (B) There he saw many species.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. There he saw many species.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom would see many species on a moor, as moors are known for their diverse wildlife and plant life. It is less likely that people around him would hear noise just because he went to a moor, as this would depend on various factors such as the time of day and the activities of other people in the area."}}
{"Q": "He is diagnosed with pancreatitis in the hospital. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim's pancreas are inflamed. (B) Tom has been infected with pancreatic necrosis virus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tim's pancreas are inflamed.\nExplanation: Pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed. It can be caused by a variety of factors such as alcohol consumption, gallstones, high levels of triglycerides in the blood, certain medications, infections, and trauma to the abdomen. Pancreatic necrosis virus is not a known cause of pancreatitis, making option B an unlikely answer. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mary watched many bison in the park. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary found the small bison is similar to the older bison. (B) They were bisons too.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They were bisons too.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the fact that Mary watched many bison in the park. It is logical to assume that all the bison Mary watched were indeed bison, and therefore, the answer \"They were bisons too\" makes sense. Option A, on the other hand, does not seem to be related to the initial statement and does not provide a clear explanation of what happened as a result of Mary watching many bison in the park."}}
{"Q": "Tom has long-standing dyspepsia. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This disease caused degenerative changes of the myocardium in Tom's heart. (B) Tom had suffers from some kind of stomach condition.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom had suffers from some kind of stomach condition.\nExplanation: Dyspepsia is a medical term used to describe a group of symptoms that occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract, including stomach pain, bloating, and nausea. It is commonly caused by a stomach condition such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, or gastritis. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the symptoms and condition described in the question. Option (A) is not a likely cause of dyspepsia as it refers to a heart condition, which is not related to the gastrointestinal tract."}}
{"Q": "Nobody believed Tom's code was copied by Jack. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom compared the two set of codes as evidence in public. (B) Tom cleared  the two set of codes as evidence in public.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom compared the two set of codes as evidence in public.\n\nExplanation: Since nobody believed Tom's claim that Jack copied his code, Tom needed to provide evidence to support his claim. By comparing the two sets of codes in public, Tom could show the similarities between the two codes and prove that Jack had indeed copied his code. This would help clear Tom's name and establish the truth of the matter. Clearing the two sets of codes as evidence in public (option B) is not a plausible answer as it is unclear what this means and how it would help Tom prove his case."}}
{"Q": "He found that the mouthparts of this little ant were slowly getting bigger with age. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom raised an ant cub at home. (B) Mario feels thirsty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom raised an ant cub at home.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom raised an ant cub at home and observed its growth and development, including the gradual increase in the size of its mouthparts. This is a common phenomenon in ants, as their mouthparts are used for various tasks such as feeding, grooming, and defense. As the ant grows and matures, its mouthparts also develop and become more specialized for their specific functions. On the other hand, option B, Mario feeling thirsty, is not related to the growth of an ant's mouthparts and is therefore an unlikely cause."}}
{"Q": "I fed the hummingbird in my cage twice a day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I try to keep it from coldness. (B) It could not maintain its high metabolism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It could not maintain its high metabolism.\nExplanation: Hummingbirds have a very high metabolism and require a constant supply of nectar to maintain their energy levels. Feeding a hummingbird in a cage twice a day may not be enough to meet its energy requirements, leading to a decrease in its metabolism and overall health. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) is not relevant to the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "The road was made of concrete. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The road should be of high strength. (B) The road should be of high freezing resistance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Concrete is a popular choice for road construction because it is strong and durable. It can withstand heavy traffic and weather conditions, making it a practical choice for roads that will see a lot of use. Therefore, the most plausible reason for the road being made of concrete is that it needed to be of high strength to handle the weight of vehicles and other factors that could cause damage. While freezing resistance is also important, it is not the primary reason for choosing concrete as a road material."}}
{"Q": "Tom has lost his way. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He betrayed his partners for his own benefit. (B) Tom took out the map and began to determine his location.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom took out the map and began to determine his location.\nExplanation: When someone loses their way, the most plausible action would be to try and find their way back. In this case, Tom took out the map to determine his location and find his way back. Betraying his partners for his own benefit is not a logical consequence of losing one's way."}}
{"Q": "Tom's mother has allergies-hay fever. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom also has allergies- hay fever. (B) His feelings of well being during the day diminished a lot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Allergies, including hay fever, can be hereditary. Therefore, it is plausible that Tom also has allergies-hay fever as a result of his mother having it. Option B is less likely as it is not directly related to the genetic predisposition to allergies."}}
{"Q": "He jointed too many activities. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He betrayed his partners for his own benefit. (B) He felt tired.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He felt tired.\nExplanation: When someone joins too many activities, they may become overwhelmed and exhausted from trying to keep up with all of them. This can lead to burnout and a decrease in productivity, but it is unlikely to result in betrayal of partners for personal gain. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His blood vessel are obstructed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a tumor in the patient's blood vessel. (B) There is a hole in the patient's blood vessel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There is a tumor in the patient's blood vessel.\nExplanation: Tumors can grow inside blood vessels and obstruct blood flow. On the other hand, a hole in a blood vessel would cause bleeding rather than obstruction. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack's mother never lets him take part in any kind of activities. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He never gets in a dangerous situation as other kids do. (B) He has no free time to entertain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He has no free time to entertain.\nExplanation: If Jack's mother never lets him take part in any kind of activities, it means he is not allowed to participate in any extracurricular or leisure activities. As a result, he would have no free time to entertain himself or pursue his interests. This could lead to boredom, frustration, and a lack of social skills, which could affect his overall development. While it is true that he may not get into dangerous situations like other kids, this is not a guaranteed outcome and is not a direct result of his mother's restrictions on his activities."}}
{"Q": "Amy doesn't want to have contact with petrochemicals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chemicals derived from petroleum can be dangerous. (B) The factory discharges industrial waste into the water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Chemicals derived from petroleum can be dangerous.\nExplanation: Petrochemicals are chemicals that are derived from petroleum or natural gas. Many of these chemicals can be harmful to human health and the environment. Exposure to petrochemicals has been linked to various health problems, including cancer, respiratory issues, and reproductive problems. Therefore, it is understandable that Amy would want to avoid contact with petrochemicals to protect her health and well-being."}}
{"Q": "A has higher pressure than B. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A weights heavier than B. (B) B weights heavier than A.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The weight of the objects has no direct correlation with their pressure. Pressure is determined by the force exerted on a given area. Therefore, if A has a higher pressure than B, it means that there is a greater force being exerted on A's surface area compared to B's surface area. This could be due to a variety of factors such as the amount of gas or liquid inside A and B, the temperature, or the external force being applied to A and B."}}
{"Q": "Jack doesn't like vegetables with slender stalks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He never eats celery. (B) He hasn't pay many attentions on the disease.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He never eats celery.\nExplanation: Since Jack doesn't like vegetables with slender stalks, he would avoid eating celery which has a slender stalk. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have any connection with Jack's dislike for vegetables with slender stalks."}}
{"Q": "Drought stress weakens plant water potential and photosynthesis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plants were beginning to wilt. (B) The plant harvest was affected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The plants were beginning to wilt.\nExplanation: Drought stress causes a decrease in plant water potential, which means that the plant is not able to take up enough water to meet its needs. This can lead to wilting, as the plant's cells lose turgor pressure and the leaves droop. While a decrease in photosynthesis can also affect plant growth and yield, wilting is a more immediate and visible symptom of drought stress. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She is a technician. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her knowledge is very profound. (B) She has to absorb water every once in a while.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her knowledge is very profound.\nExplanation: Being a technician requires a certain level of knowledge and expertise in a specific field. Therefore, it is more plausible that as a result of being a technician, her knowledge is very profound. Option B, which suggests that she has to absorb water every once in a while, is not related to being a technician and seems unlikely."}}
{"Q": "She bought a book and began reading. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice enjoys her free time. (B) Lucy has waited for Tom for a long time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Alice enjoys her free time.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Alice bought a book and began reading, indicating that she had free time and chose to spend it reading. There is no mention of Lucy or Tom, so option B is irrelevant to the sentence. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom drank a lot and passed out. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor diagnosed him with alcohol poisoning. (B) He fainted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He fainted.\nExplanation: While it is possible that Tom could have alcohol poisoning from drinking too much, the fact that he simply passed out suggests that he fainted from the effects of the alcohol. Fainting is a common side effect of excessive drinking, as it can cause a drop in blood pressure and oxygen levels in the brain. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Farmers know how to pollinate flowers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom needed to pollinate his plants. (B) The farm grows many flowers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The fact that farmers know how to pollinate flowers suggests that there was a need for them to do so, which is described in option A. Option B is not a plausible explanation as it only states that the farm grows many flowers, but does not explain why farmers would need to know how to pollinate them."}}
{"Q": "They added air into the water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They did an experiment about aeration. (B) The little boy suffers from roseola.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They did an experiment about aeration.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"they added air into the water,\" which suggests a deliberate action. The most plausible reason for adding air to water is to increase its oxygen content, which is often done in experiments to study the effects of aeration on aquatic organisms or to improve water quality. The second option, that a little boy suffers from roseola, is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide a logical explanation for why air was added to the water."}}
{"Q": "The shop sells combs. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People buy them for their need. (B) People buy them for their ears.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. People buy them for their need.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that people buy combs for their intended purpose, which is to groom and style their hair. While some people may use combs to clean their ears, it is not a common or primary reason for purchasing a comb. Therefore, option A is a more likely outcome of the shop selling combs."}}
{"Q": "John was  thirsty but had no water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found a vase as a substitute. (B) He ate some vegetables.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He ate some vegetables.\nExplanation: Since John was thirsty and had no water, it is more plausible that he would look for an alternative source of hydration. Eating vegetables can provide some level of hydration and may have been a more realistic option for John in this situation compared to finding a vase as a substitute for water."}}
{"Q": "Many domestic cats lack the ability of adaptation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They can't live well in a strange environment. (B) They are ill-adapted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Domestic cats that lack the ability of adaptation may struggle to adjust to new environments, making it difficult for them to live well in unfamiliar surroundings. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and other health problems, as well as making it harder for them to find food, shelter, and other resources they need to survive. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They found that the breasts grow during this time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The female elephant in the zoo is getting old. (B) The scientist focused on caring for the breasts for the first few weeks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The female elephant in the zoo is getting old.\nExplanation: As female elephants age, their hormone levels change and they may experience growth in their breasts. This is a natural process and is not related to any specific care or attention from scientists. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not relevant to the growth of breasts in elephants."}}
{"Q": "His mother bought the fermented dough from the supermarket. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The starch was placed in fridge for a long time. (B) Tom wants to eat pizza tonight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The cause of the mother buying fermented dough from the supermarket is most likely that the starch was placed in the fridge for a long time. Fermentation occurs when yeast or bacteria break down the carbohydrates in the dough, producing carbon dioxide gas and causing the dough to rise. If the dough is left in the fridge for too long, the yeast or bacteria can continue to ferment the dough, resulting in an over-fermented and sour-tasting dough. Therefore, it is more plausible that the mother bought the fermented dough from the supermarket because the starch she had at home had been in the fridge for too long and had become over-fermented."}}
{"Q": "The ape in the zoo was single last year. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This year it's got a baby ape on its back. (B) The zoo employed a lot of keepers to complete the task.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the ape in the zoo got a baby ape on its back this year as a result of mating with another ape or being artificially inseminated. The option of the zoo employing a lot of keepers to complete the task does not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "When charged, the tungsten wires will excite the air atoms and emit light. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bulbs contain tungsten wires and air. (B) Mike placed a small magnetic needle next to the energized coil.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: When an electric current passes through the tungsten wires in a light bulb, the wires become very hot and emit light. This process is called incandescence. The air inside the bulb does not play a direct role in the emission of light, but it does help to prevent the tungsten wires from burning up by providing a stable environment. Therefore, choice A is the more plausible answer. Choice B is not related to the emission of light in a light bulb."}}
{"Q": "David committed the sin of schism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) David was sentenced to hang. (B) He became violent.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: None of the above.\nExplanation: While David did commit the sin of schism by dividing the kingdom of Israel, he was not sentenced to hang or became violent as a result. Instead, his actions led to a period of political instability and conflict between the northern and southern kingdoms of Israel."}}
{"Q": "Tom is hesitant about what major he will study in college. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decides to choose anthropology as his major in college. (B) He finally decided to be a student majoring in microbial physiology.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He decides to choose anthropology as his major in college.\nExplanation: Since Tom is hesitant about what major he will study in college, it is more plausible that he would choose a major that he is interested in and feels comfortable with, rather than a highly specialized field like microbial physiology. Anthropology is a broad field that covers a range of topics, and Tom may find it easier to explore his interests and find his niche within this field. Additionally, anthropology is a popular major that is offered at many colleges and universities, making it a more accessible option for Tom."}}
{"Q": "They found that those animals lived in their habit from ancient and never moved away. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sheep easily run away. (B) They studied the life habits of many wild animals in South Africa.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the animals in question have lived in their habitat for a long time and have never moved away. This implies that they are not migratory animals and are likely to be domesticated or tamed animals like sheep. Choice A, which states that sheep easily run away, is a more plausible answer as it explains why the animals have not moved away from their habitat despite being domesticated. Choice B is not relevant to the statement and does not provide a plausible explanation for the animals' behavior."}}
{"Q": "He bought lots of truffles. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wanted some subterranean fungi. (B) Black's mother said that Black should have a good habit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He wanted some subterranean fungi.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the action of buying truffles. Truffles are a type of subterranean fungi that are highly prized for their unique flavor and aroma. It is common for people to buy truffles because they enjoy the taste or want to use them in cooking. On the other hand, option B seems less likely as it does not provide a clear reason for buying truffles and is not directly related to the action."}}
{"Q": "He found that they had body temperature. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had a bath. (B) He measured the birds with a thermometer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He measured the birds with a thermometer.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the person measured the birds' body temperature with a thermometer, which is a common method used to determine the body temperature of animals. Taking a bath would not cause the birds to have a body temperature, as they would naturally have one regardless of the person's actions."}}
{"Q": "It layed eggs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The kudzu was exposed to the oxygen. (B) The rattlesnake was pregnant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The rattlesnake was pregnant.\nExplanation: Snakes, like many other animals, reproduce by laying eggs or giving birth to live young. In this case, the most plausible explanation for the laying of eggs is that the rattlesnake was pregnant and had reached the stage of laying eggs. The exposure to oxygen, as mentioned in option A, is not a factor that would cause a snake to lay eggs."}}
{"Q": "He redesigned the product for better utility. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The product designer aimed to enhance customers' satisfaction. (B) The chief bought oats.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The product designer aimed to enhance customers' satisfaction.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the product was redesigned for better utility, which implies that the previous design was not meeting the customers' needs or expectations. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the product designer aimed to enhance customers' satisfaction by improving the product's functionality and usability. Option B, on the other hand, is irrelevant and does not provide any explanation for the product redesign."}}
{"Q": "When I saw them again today, I noticed that exfoliation occured. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their group was in charge of the gelatin Infiltration. (B) I found that many deeply-buried rocks were exposed at the earth's surface by erosion long time ago.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Exfoliation is a process where layers of rock peel off due to changes in temperature or pressure. It is unlikely that erosion of deeply-buried rocks would cause exfoliation in this context. On the other hand, if the group was in charge of gelatin infiltration, they may have used chemicals or other methods that caused the rock to undergo exfoliation. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Amy has a unsually light weight compared with others. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy was born with deficiencies in legs. (B) A weights heavier than B.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Amy was born with deficiencies in legs.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Amy's light weight is due to a physical condition or genetic factor, such as deficiencies in her legs, rather than simply using lighter weights than others. Using lighter weights would not necessarily result in a significantly lighter overall weight compared to others."}}
{"Q": "Mike was exposed to the Rhinoviruses. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He suffered from bronchitis. (B) His lung functions were seriously affected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer.\nExplanation: Rhinoviruses are a common cause of the common cold, which typically affects the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, throat, and sinuses. While bronchitis is a respiratory condition that affects the lower respiratory tract, including the bronchial tubes, it is not typically caused by rhinoviruses. Similarly, while some respiratory viruses can cause serious lung function impairment, rhinoviruses are not typically associated with severe respiratory complications. Therefore, a more plausible answer would be that Mike likely experienced symptoms of the common cold, such as a runny nose, sore throat, and cough, but did not suffer from bronchitis or serious lung function impairment as a direct result of the rhinovirus infection."}}
{"Q": "Tom threw a ball at his teacher. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The ball hit his teacher. (B) Possiblly he had a crash on her.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The ball hit his teacher.\nExplanation: Based on the information given, the most plausible answer is that the ball hit the teacher. There is no indication or reason to believe that Tom had a crush on his teacher, and throwing a ball at someone is not a typical way of expressing romantic interest. Therefore, option A is the most logical conclusion."}}
{"Q": "She used PS to improve the intensification. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The product designer aimed to enhance customers' satisfaction. (B) Lucy has taken a vague photo.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The use of PS to improve intensification suggests that the original photo was not clear or vivid enough. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy took a vague photo and used PS to enhance its quality rather than the product designer aiming to enhance customers' satisfaction."}}
{"Q": "The butcher killed the goat with a dull blade in public. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The goat had a big gash in its throat that bled for quite a bit. (B) The goat's head was chopped off.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The goat had a big gash in its throat that bled for quite a bit.\nExplanation: If the butcher used a dull blade to kill the goat, it would have caused a lot of pain and suffering to the animal. It is likely that the blade would not have cleanly cut through the goat's neck, resulting in a big gash that would have bled for some time. Chopping off the goat's head would have required a sharp blade and a skilled butcher, which is unlikely in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Amy sees bronchi on either side of the trachea. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy has tracheitis. (B) Amy observes the patient's tracheae.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If Amy sees bronchi on either side of the trachea, it is likely that she is observing the patient's tracheae. This is a normal anatomical feature, as the trachea branches into two bronchi that lead to the lungs. Tracheitis, or inflammation of the trachea, would not cause the appearance of bronchi on either side of the trachea."}}
{"Q": "She felt the texture of the flowers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She stroked the petals with her fingers. (B) Butterflies pollinate flowers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She stroked the petals with her fingers.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that she felt the texture of the flowers because she stroked the petals with her fingers. This is a common way to explore the texture of flowers, as the petals can have a variety of textures, from soft and velvety to rough and prickly. Butterflies pollinating flowers is not directly related to the sensation of feeling the texture of the flowers."}}
{"Q": "Monkeys know how to induce insects with sticks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They can feed themselves on insects. (B) They can always accurately locate the insects.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They can feed themselves on insects.\nExplanation: Monkeys have learned to use sticks to extract insects from crevices or holes in trees. This skill allows them to access a food source that they may not have been able to reach otherwise. While it is possible that they may also become better at locating insects over time, the primary benefit of this behavior is the ability to feed themselves on insects."}}
{"Q": "The water cycle went to a halt here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wires were cut out in this building. (B) There is no rainfall at all here.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. There is no rainfall at all here.\nExplanation: The water cycle involves the continuous movement of water from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere and back again. One of the key components of this cycle is precipitation, which includes rainfall. If there is no rainfall in a particular area, then the water cycle cannot continue as it should. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the water cycle coming to a halt is due to the lack of rainfall rather than wires being cut out in a building, which would not have a direct impact on the water cycle."}}
{"Q": "Lila was infected with amebiasis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was uncomfortable. (B) Her skin can better stay intact.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She was uncomfortable.\nExplanation: Amebiasis is an infection caused by the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica, which can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and cramping. These symptoms can be uncomfortable and can last for several weeks if left untreated. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lila would experience discomfort as a result of the infection rather than her skin staying intact."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's physical condition cannot support her to give birth to a child. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy's physical condition cannot support her to give birth to a child. (B) Lucy has a strong ability of adaptation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy's physical condition cannot support her to give birth to a child.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly addresses the issue of Lucy's inability to give birth. Option B, which suggests that Lucy has a strong ability of adaptation, does not provide any explanation for her physical condition."}}
{"Q": "It swallowed the whole mouse. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The psyllid was hungry. (B) The copperhead snake caught a mouse.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The copperhead snake caught a mouse.\nExplanation: Snakes are known to swallow their prey whole, and copperhead snakes are known to eat small rodents like mice. Psyllids, on the other hand, are tiny insects that feed on plant sap and would not be capable of swallowing a whole mouse. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Not soon later the rocks in the pond were super clean and bald. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom scattered some big pieces of food into the tadpoles pond. (B) Some limpets were put into a pond where algae prospered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Limpets are known to feed on algae, so if they were put into a pond where algae was abundant, they would have likely consumed it, leaving the rocks clean and bald. On the other hand, scattering big pieces of food into a tadpole pond would not necessarily lead to the rocks becoming clean and bald."}}
{"Q": "A lot of the ice melted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The climate around the iceberg changed. (B) The large amount of glaciers collpased and were burried underground.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The climate around the iceberg changed.\nExplanation: The melting of ice is often caused by a change in temperature or climate. If the temperature around the iceberg increases, the ice will start to melt. This can be due to global warming or other environmental factors. Option B, the collapse of glaciers and burial underground, is not a likely cause for the melting of ice in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "The  researcher wants to know the essence of grain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He analyzed the components of it. (B) He cannot find the components of it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He analyzed the components of it.\nExplanation: In order to understand the essence of grain, the researcher would need to analyze its components and properties. This would involve breaking down the grain into its constituent parts and examining them in detail. By doing so, the researcher would be able to gain a deeper understanding of what makes grain unique and how it functions in various contexts. Therefore, it is more plausible that the researcher would analyze the components of grain rather than being unable to find them."}}
{"Q": "He always burns firewood to keep warm. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chris is cold in winter. (B) Tom lives in a forest where the weather is warm and moist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Chris is cold in winter.\nExplanation: The fact that he burns firewood to keep warm suggests that Chris is experiencing cold temperatures. Option B, which suggests that Tom lives in a forest where the weather is warm and moist, does not explain why he would need to burn firewood to keep warm. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There's a lot of crime in ABC. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Detectives are unemployed. (B) ABC is a country with a very backward social development.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the high crime rate in ABC is due to the country's backward social development. This could mean that there is a lack of education, poverty, and inequality, which are all factors that contribute to crime. On the other hand, the option A about unemployed detectives may be a contributing factor, but it is unlikely to be the sole cause of the high crime rate."}}
{"Q": "Many of them use rivers as their habitat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many animals are searching for suitable habitats. (B) Varnishes utilize refraction of light.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Many animals are searching for suitable habitats.\n\nExplanation: Rivers provide a suitable habitat for many animals due to the availability of water, food, and shelter. Many animals have adapted to living in or near rivers to take advantage of these resources. Additionally, rivers often provide a diverse range of habitats, such as rapids, pools, and riffles, which can support a variety of different species. Therefore, it is more plausible that animals use rivers as their habitat because they are searching for suitable habitats rather than varnishes utilizing refraction of light."}}
{"Q": "Jack was tested positive for stimulant. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack ate a bar of chocolate before the game. (B) She can not stand the old drug's effect.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jack ate a bar of chocolate before the game.\nExplanation: Chocolate contains a small amount of caffeine, which is a stimulant. If Jack ate a bar of chocolate before the game, it could have caused him to test positive for a stimulant. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any information about what drug Jack may have taken and why it would cause a positive test result."}}
{"Q": "Ceftriaxone can resist many kinds of bacteria. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He can be protected from coldness. (B) Doctors often prescribe this medicine to patients.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can resist many types of bacteria. Due to its effectiveness, doctors often prescribe this medicine to patients who have bacterial infections. It is not related to protecting someone from coldness."}}
{"Q": "Critters time their reproductive cycle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is used to the seasonal variability. (B) The chances of their babies' survival can be maximized.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The chances of their babies' survival can be maximized.\n\nExplanation: By timing their reproductive cycle, critters can ensure that their offspring are born during a time when food and resources are abundant, and environmental conditions are favorable for their survival. This increases the chances of their babies' survival and overall reproductive success. For example, many animals give birth in the spring when food is plentiful and temperatures are mild, which provides the best conditions for their young to thrive. By timing their reproductive cycle, critters can increase the likelihood that their offspring will survive and pass on their genes to the next generation."}}
{"Q": "Gunshots always happen in America. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Statistics reveal that many children die from firearm every year. (B) All citizens have the right to take a gun with them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Statistics reveal that many children die from firearm every year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2019, there were 39,707 firearm-related deaths in the United States, including 23,941 suicides and 14,414 homicides. Additionally, a study published in the journal Pediatrics found that an average of 1,297 children die from firearm-related injuries each year in the United States. The easy availability of guns and lack of strict gun control laws contribute to the high number of gun-related deaths and shootings in America."}}
{"Q": "Bob is a diner. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is eating bread. (B) He opens the door.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer as the question does not provide enough information to determine what happened as a result of Bob being a diner. More context is needed to provide a meaningful answer."}}
{"Q": "Leads can be touched by hands. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Budgerigars live on cliffs. (B) Wires covered by soft flexible plastic are touchable.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The cause of leads being touchable by hands is due to the wires being covered by soft flexible plastic. This makes them safe to handle and touch without causing harm or injury. Option (A) about budgerigars living on cliffs is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for the given statement."}}
{"Q": "Earthquake close to sea leads to tsunami. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Massive waves of the sea brings in tsunami. (B) Massive waves of the sea brings in earthquake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Massive waves of the sea brings in tsunami.\nExplanation: When an earthquake occurs under the sea, it can cause the water above it to move and create massive waves. These waves can travel across the ocean and reach the shore, causing a tsunami. Therefore, the cause of a tsunami is the displacement of a large volume of water due to an earthquake, volcanic eruption, or landslide under the sea. It is not caused by waves bringing in an earthquake."}}
{"Q": "Tom had a heart attack suddenly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He died of it. (B) The utility has saved his life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The utility has saved his life.\nExplanation: If Tom had a heart attack suddenly and the utility was able to intervene and provide medical assistance, it is more likely that they were able to save his life rather than him dying from it. It is important to seek medical attention immediately in the event of a heart attack, and the utility's quick response could have made all the difference in Tom's survival."}}
{"Q": "The wind here is very strong. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The wind took away a lot of silt particles. (B) Farmland and houses will be destroyed by wind and heavy rainfall.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The wind took away a lot of silt particles.\nExplanation: Strong winds can cause erosion and transport of soil particles. Silt particles are small and light, making them more susceptible to being carried away by wind. However, it is unlikely that farmland and houses will be destroyed by wind and heavy rainfall based solely on the information given in the question."}}
{"Q": "The policewomen set about investigating the case. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A neighbor reported to the police that Tom had a drug deal in his house. (B) There was a murder case in this area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"investigating the case,\" which implies that there is a specific incident that the policewomen are looking into. Option A provides a clear reason for the investigation, as a neighbor reporting a drug deal would likely prompt police action. Option B, while also a possible reason for police presence, is not as directly related to the investigation mentioned in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "This plane can't take off normally. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The wing on one side of the plane malfunctioned. (B) The ground is dry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The wing on one side of the plane malfunctioned.\nExplanation: If one wing of the plane malfunctions, it can cause an imbalance in lift and prevent the plane from taking off normally. On the other hand, the dryness of the ground would not directly affect the plane's ability to take off."}}
{"Q": "Lucy can dive to the bottom of the sea. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy is carrying an oxygen tank. (B) Lucy has a strong ability of adaptation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lucy has a strong ability of adaptation, such as being able to hold her breath for a long time or having developed physiological adaptations that allow her to dive to the bottom of the sea without the need for an oxygen tank. While carrying an oxygen tank is a possibility, it is less likely as it would be cumbersome and limit her mobility underwater."}}
{"Q": "Evaporation is obvious in hot Hainan Island. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Coral reefs are formed here. (B) Hainan Island has abundant precipitation all year round.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Hainan Island has abundant precipitation all year round.\n\nExplanation: Evaporation is a process where water changes from a liquid state to a gaseous state. In hot regions like Hainan Island, evaporation rates are high, which means that more water is being converted into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere and eventually condenses to form clouds. These clouds then release precipitation in the form of rain or snow. Therefore, it is more plausible that Hainan Island has abundant precipitation all year round due to the high evaporation rates caused by the hot climate. Coral reefs, on the other hand, are formed due to the accumulation of calcium carbonate skeletons secreted by coral polyps over time, and are not directly related to evaporation rates."}}
{"Q": "Collecting of plants from the wild were not under control. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Snowdrops are threatened. (B) The ecological balance was damaged.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The ecological balance was damaged.\nExplanation: When plants are collected from the wild without proper control, it can lead to over-harvesting and depletion of certain species. This can disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem, affecting other plants and animals that depend on those species for food or habitat. Additionally, the removal of certain plants can also lead to soil erosion and other environmental problems. Therefore, uncontrolled collecting of plants from the wild can have serious ecological consequences. While snowdrops may be threatened by over-harvesting, it is just one example of the larger issue of ecological imbalance caused by uncontrolled plant collection."}}
{"Q": "The food here was poisoned by mycotoxins. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) You should not touch its surface. (B) The food was not eatable.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The food was not eatable.\nExplanation: Mycotoxins are toxic substances produced by certain types of fungi that can contaminate food. Consuming food contaminated with mycotoxins can cause a range of health problems, including nausea, vomiting, and even death in severe cases. Therefore, if the food was poisoned by mycotoxins, it would not be safe to eat and should be discarded. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not address the issue of the food being contaminated with mycotoxins."}}
{"Q": "Poor John hoped to start his own business. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mother explained to him patiently using the picture book at home. (B) He turned to reliable proposals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He turned to reliable proposals.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Poor John had a desire to start his own business, but it does not provide any information about his mother explaining anything to him using a picture book. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer. On the other hand, turning to reliable proposals is a common approach for someone who wants to start a business. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Researchers found that the metabolism of mice accelerated. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The researchers fed the mice some capsicums. (B) The researchers injected glucose into mice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The researchers fed the mice some capsicums.\nExplanation: Capsicums contain capsaicin, which has been shown to increase metabolism in both humans and animals. Injecting glucose into mice would not necessarily accelerate their metabolism."}}
{"Q": "Permanently frozen ground were utilized to protect them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The agriculturist placed the peanuts under sitimulate drought conditions. (B) Only Permafrost can preserve these special seeds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Permafrost is a layer of permanently frozen ground that can preserve organic matter, including seeds, for thousands of years. This is because the freezing temperatures prevent decay and other biological processes that would normally break down the seeds over time. Therefore, it is more plausible that the peanuts were stored in permafrost to protect them rather than being placed under simulated drought conditions by an agriculturist."}}
{"Q": "Her autopsy showed that she died of suffocation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jane shows symptoms of hypothyroidism. (B) Emma was locked in her throat by a robber.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Emma was locked in her throat by a robber.\nExplanation: The autopsy report clearly states that the cause of death was suffocation, which suggests that something obstructed Emma's airway. Option A, which mentions hypothyroidism, is not related to suffocation. On the other hand, option B suggests that Emma was robbed and the robber may have used force to block her airway, leading to suffocation. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I think it is like a lizard. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a anols in the room. (B) My girlfriend describe the caterpillar she just saw.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The description of a lizard-like creature is more likely to be associated with a caterpillar than an anole, as anoles are typically described as small, agile lizards with distinct features such as a dewlap. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the statement was the girlfriend's description of a caterpillar she just saw."}}
{"Q": "This shop sells both high-quality and low-quality wines. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Visitors find it easy to distinguish them. (B) The price of high-quality wine is much more expensive.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the price of high-quality wine is much more expensive in this shop, as this is a common practice in the wine industry. Visitors may not find it easy to distinguish between the two types of wine, as taste preferences can vary greatly among individuals. However, pricing is often a clear indicator of quality in the wine market."}}
{"Q": "The boy bite the lemon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Saliva flew out from his mouth. (B) He spited out several seeds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Saliva flew out from his mouth.\nExplanation: When someone bites into a lemon, the sour taste can cause their salivary glands to produce more saliva than usual. This excess saliva can cause it to fly out from their mouth, making option A the more plausible answer. Option B is less likely as lemons typically do not contain seeds that are large enough to be noticeable or cause someone to spit them out."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to choose a letter to represent the partial pressure of carbon dioxide. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He loves the beautiful structureb of it. (B) He uses capitalized P.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He uses capitalized P.\n\nExplanation: It is common practice in chemistry to use capitalized letters to represent variables that are extensive properties, such as pressure, volume, and temperature. In this case, Tom wants to represent the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, which is an extensive property, so it makes sense for him to use a capitalized letter, such as P. Option A, on the other hand, is not relevant to the question and does not provide a plausible explanation for Tom's choice of letter."}}
{"Q": "The scientist has collected some minerals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He takes in substances of nutrition from them. (B) He has found magnesium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He has found magnesium.\nExplanation: The fact that the scientist has collected minerals does not necessarily mean that he has taken in substances of nutrition from them. However, it is possible that he has found magnesium or other minerals during his collection, which would be a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He is a nuturalist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He thinks about both direct and indirect benefits of harvests. (B) He goes all over the world to collect specimens.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: A naturalist is someone who studies and observes the natural world, including plants, animals, and their habitats. Therefore, it is more plausible that a naturalist would travel around the world to collect specimens and study them in their natural habitats rather than thinking about the direct and indirect benefits of harvests. While a naturalist may have an understanding of the benefits of certain plants and animals, their main focus is on studying and understanding the natural world."}}
{"Q": "Sean's immune system was damaged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy was wearing a skirt. (B) The adenoviruses in Sean reacts strongly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The adenoviruses in Sean reacts strongly.\nExplanation: Adenoviruses are known to cause respiratory infections and can weaken the immune system. If Sean's immune system was damaged, it is likely that the adenoviruses he was exposed to caused a strong reaction in his body, leading to the damage. Lucy wearing a skirt is not a plausible cause for Sean's immune system damage."}}
{"Q": "Furan is a good choice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We need a substitute of dioxin. (B) Tom searched the typical names of fullerenes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: The statement suggests that Furan was chosen as a substitute for dioxin, indicating that dioxin was not a desirable option. Furan is a cyclic organic compound that is structurally similar to dioxin but is less toxic and less persistent in the environment. Therefore, it is a better choice as a substitute for dioxin. The option B about Tom searching the typical names of fullerenes is not related to the statement and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He is proficient in the use of gerund. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Animals eat grain and die. (B) He knows the compound structure of gerund.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If someone is proficient in the use of gerunds, it means they have a good understanding of how to use them in sentences. Therefore, the most plausible result would be that they know the compound structure of gerunds, as stated in option B. Option A is completely unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "America is a country of tolerance. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Li Ming has the same habits with people from Taiwan. (B) It accepted diverse cultures.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: As a result of America being a country of tolerance, it has accepted diverse cultures. This means that people from different backgrounds, ethnicities, and nationalities are welcomed and respected in American society. This has led to a rich and diverse cultural landscape in the country, with people from all over the world contributing to its social, economic, and political fabric. Li Ming having the same habits as people from Taiwan may or may not be a result of America's tolerance, as it depends on Li Ming's personal background and experiences. However, the acceptance of diverse cultures is a more plausible outcome of America's tolerance."}}
{"Q": "Data show that the earth's orbit has changed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ice ages followed. (B) Nothing happened after that.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ice ages followed.\nExplanation: The Milankovitch cycles, which are changes in the earth's orbit and axial tilt, have been linked to the occurrence of ice ages. When the earth's orbit is more elliptical, it receives more solar radiation, leading to warmer temperatures and less ice accumulation. Conversely, when the orbit is more circular, the earth receives less solar radiation, leading to cooler temperatures and more ice accumulation. Therefore, changes in the earth's orbit can have a significant impact on the climate, and the occurrence of ice ages is a plausible result of such changes."}}
{"Q": "There are some voles in the field. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The farmer has used some pesticide to drive away them to avoid damaging the field. (B) They utilize different strategies to win.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If there are voles in the field, they can cause damage to crops and plants. Therefore, it is likely that the farmer would use some form of pesticide to drive them away and protect their crops. While it is possible that the voles could utilize different strategies to win, this is less likely as they are not typically known for being strategic animals."}}
{"Q": "These jockeys were very hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They prepared something to protect their knees. (B) They enjoyed the delicious food very much.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They enjoyed the delicious food very much.\nExplanation: Since the jockeys were very hungry, it is more plausible that they would eat and enjoy the food rather than prepare something to protect their knees."}}
{"Q": "She could start her travel at once. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is a student majoring in botany. (B) Jessi stepped on the craft.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of her being able to start her travel at once is most likely due to Jessi stepping on the craft. The sentence does not mention anything about Tom being a student majoring in botany, so it is not a plausible answer. However, Jessi stepping on the craft suggests that the transportation she needed was available and ready for her to use, allowing her to start her travel immediately."}}
{"Q": "The girl keeps reading. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her brain keeps thinking. (B) The girl generate a sense of love on cichlids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her brain keeps thinking.\nExplanation: When someone reads, their brain is constantly processing and interpreting the information they are reading. This means that the girl's brain would continue to think and process the information she is reading, even after she stops reading. While reading about cichlids may generate an interest or curiosity in them, it is unlikely that it would result in a sense of love for them without further interaction or experience with the fish. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The nutritionist arranges her diet every day. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jenny's Schnauzer is 15 years old. (B) The actress hires a professional nutritionist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The actress hires a professional nutritionist.\nExplanation: The fact that the nutritionist arranges her diet every day suggests that she is doing so as part of her job as a professional nutritionist. Option A, which mentions Jenny's Schnauzer being 15 years old, is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for why the nutritionist arranges her diet every day. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to deprive himself from the disease of compulsive overeating. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has to stick to abstinence. (B) He is super healthy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He has to stick to abstinence.\nExplanation: Compulsive overeating is a disorder characterized by the inability to control one's eating habits, leading to excessive consumption of food even when not hungry. To avoid this, Tom would need to stick to abstinence, which means completely avoiding trigger foods or situations that may lead to overeating. This can be challenging, but it is a common approach to managing compulsive overeating and promoting a healthier lifestyle. Being super healthy is not necessarily a direct result of abstaining from compulsive overeating, as there are many other factors that contribute to overall health."}}
{"Q": "Moa and ostrich looks very similar but are different. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Moas has furry feathers around their necks. (B) They cut their roots for food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Moas have furry feathers around their necks.\nExplanation: Moas and ostriches may look similar, but they evolved in different parts of the world and have distinct physical characteristics. Moas were native to New Zealand and had to adapt to colder temperatures, which led to the development of furry feathers around their necks for insulation. Ostriches, on the other hand, are native to Africa and have adapted to hot temperatures, which is why they have bare necks to help regulate their body temperature. Therefore, it is more plausible that moas have furry feathers around their necks as a result of their unique evolutionary history, rather than cutting their roots for food, which is not related to their physical appearance."}}
{"Q": "There are too much dirty plasma in his body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The clearance in Tom's body is too low. (B) John has severe inflammation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The clearance in Tom's body is too low.\n\nExplanation: Plasma is the liquid component of blood that carries nutrients, hormones, and proteins throughout the body. If there is too much dirty plasma in the body, it means that the plasma is not being filtered properly and waste products are accumulating. This can be caused by a low clearance rate, which means that the kidneys are not functioning properly and are not able to filter waste products from the blood. In contrast, severe inflammation (option B) may cause an increase in the production of plasma proteins, but it is not directly related to the accumulation of dirty plasma. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woodwind member in our orchestra invited him to join us. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The oboe player craved for a job. (B) The meeting ends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The oboe player was impressed with his musical abilities and wanted him to join the orchestra.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the woodwind member invited him to join the orchestra, implying that the oboe player was impressed with his musical abilities. Choice (A) is unlikely as it suggests that the oboe player was desperate for a job, which is not mentioned in the sentence. Choice (B) is also incorrect as it is not related to the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Luke is a biochemist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He specializes in the specific area of biochemistry he is interested. (B) Some of his cells die faster than non-vegetarians'.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He specializes in the specific area of biochemistry he is interested.\nExplanation: Becoming a biochemist would likely lead Luke to specialize in a specific area of biochemistry that he is interested in, such as protein structure or enzyme kinetics. It is unlikely that his career choice would have any direct impact on the rate at which his cells die compared to non-vegetarians."}}
{"Q": "They are all born of queen bees. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A large number of small bees live in hives. (B) There are three birds who have stayed on the tree for many years.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Queen bees are the only bees in a hive that are capable of laying fertilized eggs, which develop into female worker bees or new queen bees. Therefore, a large number of small bees living in hives would increase the likelihood of having multiple queen bees, resulting in more bees being born from queen bees. On the other hand, the presence of birds on a tree has no direct correlation with the birth of queen bees."}}
{"Q": "Tom tied the leash to the bark. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He needed to open the buckle before using it. (B) The bark is damaged.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The bark is damaged.\nExplanation: Tying a leash to a tree bark can cause damage to the bark, especially if the dog pulls or tugs on the leash. This can result in the bark being stripped off or the tree being damaged. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not relevant to the given situation."}}
{"Q": "He took in excreted Pseudoephedrine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My son opened the booklets. (B) The baby drank the breast milk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The baby drank the breast milk.\nExplanation: Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant commonly found in cold and allergy medications. It is known to pass into breast milk and can cause adverse effects in infants, including irritability, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping. Therefore, if a nursing mother takes medication containing Pseudoephedrine, it can be excreted in her breast milk, and if the baby drinks the milk, they can ingest the medication. On the other hand, option A is not a plausible answer as opening booklets does not have any connection with taking in excreted Pseudoephedrine."}}
{"Q": "One person is living in the atmosphere and another person is living out of the atmosphere. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has been coughing and spitting. (B) The person who lives in the atmosphere was alive and the person which lives out of the atmosphere died.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The person who lives in the atmosphere, which is Earth's atmosphere, is likely alive and well. The person who lives out of the atmosphere, such as in space or on another planet without a breathable atmosphere, would not be able to survive without proper equipment and resources. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person living out of the atmosphere would die while the person living in the atmosphere would continue to live. Option A is not related to the scenario and does not make sense as a result of living in or out of the atmosphere."}}
{"Q": "Reactive matter can be chemically processed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Esters can be processed in chemical reactions. (B) It is an airtight container.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Esters can be processed in chemical reactions.\nExplanation: Reactive matter refers to substances that can undergo chemical reactions. Esters are a type of reactive matter that can be chemically processed to form other compounds. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the chemical processing of reactive matter. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide any relevant information about the chemical processing of reactive matter."}}
{"Q": "The necklace darkened. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy's silver necklace sat by the sink for a long time. (B) Tom put his amethysts necklace on the table and took a shower.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Silver jewelry can tarnish or darken when exposed to moisture and air for a long period of time. Therefore, it is more plausible that Amy's silver necklace darkened after sitting by the sink for a long time. Amethysts, on the other hand, are not known to darken or tarnish easily."}}
{"Q": "He only poured a little water on the cactus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He noticed the shoots it produced one day. (B) The cactus still grows well for a long time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The cactus still grows well for a long time.\nExplanation: Cacti are adapted to survive in arid environments with little water. They have specialized tissues that store water, allowing them to survive for long periods without being watered. Therefore, pouring only a little water on the cactus would not have a significant impact on its growth or survival. As long as the cactus receives enough sunlight and nutrients, it should continue to grow well for a long time. Option (A) is less plausible because it suggests that the cactus produced shoots as a direct result of the small amount of water poured on it, which is unlikely."}}
{"Q": "Tom was stabbed by the gangster. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Fortunately, the knife only stabbed the ribs. (B) The central bank don't care about the rise or fall of the currency' value.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Fortunately, the knife only stabbed the ribs.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the situation presented in the question. It suggests that Tom was lucky enough to only sustain a minor injury, which is a relief compared to the potential severity of being stabbed by a gangster. The second choice about the central bank is unrelated and irrelevant to the question."}}
{"Q": "Jack drank a lot last night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He behaved badly towards the leader. (B) He also suffers from galactosemia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Since Jack drank a lot last night, it is more plausible that he behaved badly towards the leader due to the effects of alcohol on his behavior. Galactosemia, on the other hand, is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize galactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products, and is not related to alcohol consumption."}}
{"Q": "Tom's father is a fisherman. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is good at catching mice and other animals. (B) Tom's family was fed on seafood.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom's family was fed on seafood.\nExplanation: Since Tom's father is a fisherman, it is likely that he catches fish and other seafood for a living. As a result, his family would have access to fresh seafood and would likely consume it regularly as a source of food. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as being a fisherman does not necessarily mean that one is good at catching mice and other animals."}}
{"Q": "The virus mutated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Two hundred people died. (B) The virus had more chance to get into human body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The virus had more chance to get into human body.\nExplanation: When a virus mutates, it means that its genetic material has changed. This can result in the virus becoming more infectious or more resistant to treatments. In this case, the mutation may have made the virus more easily transmissible, increasing the chances of it infecting more people. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not necessarily a direct consequence of a virus mutation and would require more context to be considered a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He understood some expressions of human experience. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is an expert in maths. (B) The man read the book of religions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The man's understanding of human experience is more likely to have been influenced by reading a book of religions, which often explore themes of human existence and spirituality, than by being an expert in maths."}}
{"Q": "My kidney got injured with impaird functions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My vertebrae was injured. (B) The nurse said I have Hypertension.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The nurse said I have Hypertension.\nExplanation: Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common cause of kidney damage and impaired kidney function. When blood pressure is consistently high, it can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to decreased kidney function over time. This can eventually lead to chronic kidney disease or even kidney failure. It is important to manage hypertension through lifestyle changes and/or medication to prevent further kidney damage."}}
{"Q": "He had to take the consequences of his attempt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He attempted to kill his wife. (B) The policeman aimed to realize his dream.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He attempted to kill his wife.\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person in question made an attempt that had consequences. The cause of these consequences is given as \"his attempt.\" The only option that provides a plausible reason for such consequences is option A, which states that he attempted to kill his wife. This is a serious crime that would have legal and personal repercussions for the person involved. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear reason for why someone would face consequences for aiming to realize their dream. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "She found a turkey merchant to buy some. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mom's restaurant lack turkeys. (B) The doctor was checking the radial canals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mom's restaurant lack turkeys.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the woman was looking for a turkey merchant to buy some turkeys. The reason for this is given in the sentence itself, which is that Mom's restaurant lacked turkeys. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is unrelated and does not make sense in the given context."}}
{"Q": "It turns out there is resistance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John wanted to improve his health. (B) The coach put dynamometers on the swimmers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The coach put dynamometers on the swimmers.\nExplanation: The use of dynamometers to measure the swimmers' resistance would likely cause resistance among the swimmers. They may feel uncomfortable or restricted by the equipment, or they may not want to be measured in this way. John's desire to improve his health is not a likely cause of resistance in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Tom's train was driving on the orbit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has to follow the change of space constantly. (B) He bought another ticket  when the train passed by the center.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Since Tom's train was driving on the orbit, it means that the train was moving in a circular path around a central point. As a result, Tom would have to constantly follow the change of space, meaning he would have to adjust his position and orientation as the train moved around the orbit. Option B, on the other hand, does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that Tom needed to buy another ticket when the train passed by the center."}}
{"Q": "The body could not be identified. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The police found a cremated body. (B) The body was exposed to bugs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The body was exposed to bugs.\nExplanation: When a body is exposed to bugs, especially for a prolonged period of time, it can cause significant damage to the body, making it difficult to identify. The bugs can eat away at the flesh and bones, making it hard to determine the person's identity through traditional means such as fingerprints or dental records. In contrast, if the police found a cremated body, it would be easier to identify the person through DNA testing or other methods. However, the question specifically mentions that the body could not be identified, which suggests that the cause is more likely to be related to decomposition due to exposure to bugs."}}
{"Q": "He focused on the definition. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mathematician met a math problem. (B) The teacher introduced glossaries.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The mathematician met a math problem.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the mathematician's focus on the definition was caused by encountering a math problem that required a clear understanding of the definition. This is a common scenario in mathematics where a problem cannot be solved without a clear understanding of the terms and definitions involved. On the other hand, the teacher introducing glossaries may help students understand definitions better, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the mathematician's focus on the definition."}}
{"Q": "Jim put the lactase and lactose together. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim drinks the milk. (B) He found the the lactose was broken down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He found that the lactose was broken down.\nExplanation: Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down lactose, a sugar found in milk. When lactase and lactose are put together, the lactase breaks down the lactose into its component sugars, glucose and galactose. This process is called lactose hydrolysis. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jim would find that the lactose was broken down rather than drinking the milk, as the lactose would have been broken down and the milk would no longer contain lactose."}}
{"Q": "Gluons can be exchanged between quarks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His design has obvious personal features. (B) Quarks are tightly bound together.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Quarks are tightly bound together.\n\nExplanation: Gluons are the force-carrying particles that mediate the strong nuclear force between quarks. When gluons are exchanged between quarks, they create a strong attraction that binds the quarks together, forming particles such as protons and neutrons. This is known as confinement, and it is the reason why quarks are never found in isolation. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) is unrelated to the topic of gluons and quarks."}}
{"Q": "Jack is having an lesson on hieroglyphs in Chinese. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He studies people's dialects in different geographical regions. (B) He learns these small pictures are used to write like alphabet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He learns these small pictures are used to write like alphabet.\nExplanation: Hieroglyphs are a system of writing that uses small pictures to represent words and sounds. Jack's lesson on hieroglyphs would have taught him that these small pictures can be combined to form words and sentences, much like how letters in an alphabet are combined to form words. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack would have learned about the use of hieroglyphs as a writing system rather than studying people's dialects in different geographical regions."}}
{"Q": "He specialized in bees. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is an Apiculturist. (B) He chose phrenology class in university.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom is an Apiculturist.\nExplanation: Apiculture is the study and management of honeybees and their colonies. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom specialized in bees because he is an apiculturist, rather than choosing a phrenology class in university, which is the study of the shape and size of the human skull as a supposed indication of character and mental abilities."}}
{"Q": "He admired the vitality of pistachios. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He saw a native plant in the desert. (B) John had cardiovascular disease.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He saw a native plant in the desert.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the admiration for the vitality of pistachios was caused by seeing a native plant in the desert, as pistachios are known to grow in arid regions and are often associated with resilience and endurance. On the other hand, John having cardiovascular disease does not seem to be related to the admiration for pistachios' vitality."}}
{"Q": "Tom has difficult in grasping abstract objects. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He cannnot master numbers. (B) He cannnot write numbers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He cannot master numbers.\n\nExplanation: Difficulty in grasping abstract objects can lead to difficulty in understanding and mastering concepts such as numbers, which are abstract in nature. This does not necessarily mean that Tom cannot physically write numbers, but rather that he may struggle with understanding their meaning and how to use them in mathematical operations."}}
{"Q": "Margarines were used to fill the statue. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The statue was heavy. (B) The statue was light.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The statue was heavy.\nExplanation: Margarines are made from vegetable oils and are solid at room temperature. When used to fill the statue, they would have added weight to it, making it heavier. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Soil erosion is serious in this area. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It requires international attention. (B) The government ordered the planting of windbreaks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The government's response to soil erosion in the area was to order the planting of windbreaks. This is a plausible solution as windbreaks can help reduce the impact of wind erosion by slowing down wind speed and trapping soil particles. It is a practical and effective measure that can be implemented locally without requiring international attention."}}
{"Q": "Antidepressants in his drugstores has the highest sales volume. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The chemical structure of inert substances are very stable. (B) Tom sells Antidepressants and other prescribed medications of good quality in US.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom sells Antidepressants and other prescribed medications of good quality in the US. This could be due to various reasons such as effective marketing strategies, good customer service, and positive word-of-mouth recommendations from satisfied customers. It is unlikely that the chemical structure of inert substances being stable would be the cause of high sales volume as this is not a factor that is typically considered by consumers when purchasing medication."}}
{"Q": "He was given vegetarian meals at the hospital. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has eaten a lot of statins. (B) A vegetarian was hospitalized after a car accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that a vegetarian was hospitalized after a car accident. Hospitals often provide special dietary accommodations for patients based on their medical needs or personal preferences. In this case, the patient being a vegetarian would be a valid reason for them to be given vegetarian meals during their stay at the hospital. Option A, which suggests that Tom has eaten a lot of statins, is not a likely cause for being given vegetarian meals at the hospital."}}
{"Q": "They showed great perseverance in the face of difficulty. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They achieved their goals. (B) They found a base.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They achieved their goals.\nExplanation: Perseverance is the quality of persisting in a task or goal despite facing difficulties or obstacles. When someone shows great perseverance, it means they are determined to succeed and will not give up easily. Therefore, it is more likely that they achieved their goals as a result of their perseverance rather than just finding a base. Finding a base may be a step towards achieving their goals, but it is not the ultimate outcome of perseverance."}}
{"Q": "Willlows are ubiquitous in this region. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The soil in this region is moist. (B) Woodlouses can have a sense of hunger.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The soil in this region is moist.\nExplanation: Willows are known to thrive in moist soil conditions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the abundance of willows in this region is due to the moist soil rather than the hunger of woodlouses."}}
{"Q": "Tom is very anxious these days. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Doctor advised him to eat more grapefruits. (B) Bread can satisfy him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Doctor advised him to eat more grapefruits.\nExplanation: Anxiety is a mental health condition that can cause physical symptoms such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. Eating grapefruits, which are high in vitamin C and antioxidants, can help reduce these symptoms and promote relaxation. Therefore, it is more plausible that a doctor would recommend eating grapefruits to manage anxiety rather than suggesting bread as a solution."}}
{"Q": "I had smallpox when I was a child. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I know how suffering viral diseases are. (B) It is normal for capuchins to do so.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Smallpox is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease that causes severe symptoms such as fever, rash, and scarring. Surviving smallpox can leave a person with lifelong physical and emotional scars. Therefore, it is likely that the person who had smallpox as a child would have a firsthand experience of how suffering viral diseases are. Option B is not related to the question and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The caterpillar waited a long time to pupate. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It eventually became a butterfly. (B) Then it will grow rapidly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It eventually became a butterfly.\nExplanation: When a caterpillar pupates, it undergoes a metamorphosis process and eventually transforms into a butterfly. The length of time it takes for a caterpillar to pupate can vary depending on the species and environmental conditions, but regardless of the duration, the end result is always the same - the caterpillar transforms into a butterfly. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not accurate as growth does not occur during the pupation stage."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes eating soft food especially marine products. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His mother usually cooks whelks for him. (B) Tom often buys avocados.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Since Tom likes eating marine products, his mother usually cooks whelks for him. This is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to Tom's preference for soft food and marine products. Option B, on the other hand, mentions avocados which are not necessarily a marine product and may not be related to Tom's preference for soft food."}}
{"Q": "Mary is learning the greek alphabet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The first letter he learns is alpha. (B) The first letter he learns is A.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The first letter she learns is alpha.\nExplanation: The Greek alphabet starts with the letter alpha, so it is more plausible that Mary would learn this letter first rather than the letter A, which is the first letter in the English alphabet."}}
{"Q": "An argali appeared in front of the hunter. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hunter followed it to find more of them. (B) Instinct leads him to a normal protein.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Instinct leads him to a normal protein.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the hunter, upon seeing the argali, would instinctively recognize it as a valuable source of protein and hunt it for food. Following it to find more of them may not be a practical or safe option, as argali are wild animals and can be dangerous."}}
{"Q": "Thyroxine were not produced. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His thyroids were exsected. (B) The food bought by the merchant was damaged in transit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His thyroids were exsected.\nExplanation: Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. If thyroxine is not produced, it is likely due to the absence or removal of the thyroid gland. Exsecting (removing) the thyroid gland would result in the cessation of thyroxine production. On the other hand, damaged food in transit would not have any direct effect on the production of thyroxine."}}
{"Q": "They make weapons every year. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cochlear implant is a common implant. (B) The villagers are afraid of fierce beasts.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The villagers are afraid of fierce beasts.\nExplanation: The production of weapons every year suggests that the villagers are preparing for a potential threat from fierce beasts. It is a common practice for communities living in areas with dangerous wildlife to arm themselves for protection. Cochlear implants, on the other hand, have nothing to do with the production of weapons."}}
{"Q": "Now he is more than five kilometers away from where he started. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has been running for half an hour. (B) He was walking on the road.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was walking on the road.\n\nExplanation: If Tom had been running for half an hour, it is unlikely that he would have only traveled five kilometers. On the other hand, if he was walking on the road, it is plausible that he could have covered that distance in that amount of time. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He found that they acted like blankets. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He observed the layers. (B) John wanted to interview the scavengers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He observed the layers.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the cause of the behavior of the objects was observed by the person. Therefore, option A, which states that he observed the layers, is a more plausible answer. Option B, which talks about John wanting to interview the scavengers, is not related to the given sentence and is an irrelevant option."}}
{"Q": "Pecans appeared on this list. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The teacher asked the students to sum up the properties of a certain vegetable. (B) The researchers tried to make a list of the world's largest fruit trees.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Pecans are not a vegetable, but a type of nut. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would appear on a list of vegetable properties. It is more plausible that the teacher asked the students to sum up the properties of a variety of foods, including nuts like pecans."}}
{"Q": "This patient had a generalized  acute viral disease caused by the mumps virus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The patient was diagnosed with the ischemia. (B) He was assigned to the ward of mumps.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The patient was diagnosed with ischemia.\n\nExplanation: Mumps is a viral infection that primarily affects the salivary glands, causing swelling and pain. However, in rare cases, mumps can lead to complications such as inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), inflammation of the testicles (orchitis), and inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis). One of the less common complications of mumps is ischemia, which occurs when there is a lack of blood flow to a particular part of the body. Ischemia can lead to tissue damage and even organ failure if left untreated. Therefore, it is more plausible that the patient was diagnosed with ischemia as a result of the mumps infection."}}
{"Q": "Black's colleagues suggested that he talk about fundamentalism to his students. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has talents in English. (B) Black's history class is about the way ancient people expressed their politics.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Black's history class is about the way ancient people expressed their politics, which could include the rise of fundamentalism in various societies. Therefore, it would be relevant and informative for Black to discuss fundamentalism with his students. Tom's talents in English are not relevant to this suggestion."}}
{"Q": "She found vertebrae in its structure. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The docter looked at the meninge part as the brain coverings on the patient's CT. (B) Jessy saw a picture of spine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor looked at the meninge part as the brain coverings on the patient's CT.\n\nExplanation: The meninges are the protective coverings of the brain and spinal cord, and they are made up of three layers. It is possible that the doctor mistook one of these layers for a vertebrae on the CT scan, leading to the mistaken observation by the patient. On the other hand, option B is not a plausible answer as seeing a picture of the spine would not cause someone to find vertebrae in the structure of the brain."}}
{"Q": "In case of danger, they choose the self-amputation of a body part to escape. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Some insects are good at hiding themselves. (B) Some insects have strong regeneration ability of leg autotomy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Some insects have strong regeneration ability of leg autotomy.\n\nExplanation: Leg autotomy is the ability of an insect to voluntarily shed or amputate its own leg in response to danger or threat. This is a common defense mechanism in many insects, such as spiders, crickets, and cockroaches. The amputated leg can then regenerate over time, allowing the insect to escape from predators or other threats. Therefore, it is more plausible that the self-amputation of a body part is due to the insect's strong regeneration ability of leg autotomy rather than their ability to hide themselves."}}
{"Q": "Tom plugged in the electricity to the machine. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found that the light was bend. (B) Only then did the machine gears start to turn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Only then did the machine gears start to turn.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because plugging in the electricity would likely be the necessary step to power the machine and allow it to function. The fact that the machine gears started to turn suggests that the machine was successfully powered on and is now operational. Option (A) about the light being bend seems unlikely and unrelated to plugging in the electricity."}}
{"Q": "Jack is taking a typing class. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is majoring in biology. (B) Jack's work requires printed papers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Jack's work requires printed papers, which would require him to type them up. It is not clear how Tom majoring in biology would lead to Jack taking a typing class."}}
{"Q": "The engineer hoped the water could be carried to his city. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He finally succeeded. (B) He bulilt a canal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He built a canal.\nExplanation: In order to carry water to his city, the engineer would need to find a way to transport it over a long distance. Building a canal would be a logical solution, as it would allow the water to flow from its source to the city. Therefore, it is more plausible that the engineer built a canal rather than simply succeeding in his hopes without any further action."}}
{"Q": "Tom just had sex with his girlfriend. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is very excited now. (B) Some semen was left in the condom after his ejaculation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Some semen was left in the condom after his ejaculation.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it is a common occurrence during sexual activity with a condom. The semen is collected in the condom and some may be left inside after ejaculation. Option A is not necessarily true for everyone and may not be a direct result of having sex with his girlfriend."}}
{"Q": "It is difficult to develop. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This mathematical problem is too complicated. (B) The project lacks financial support.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the difficulty lies in the development of something, which implies a technical or intellectual challenge. Option A suggests that the challenge is related to the complexity of a mathematical problem, which is a plausible explanation for the difficulty in development. Option B, on the other hand, suggests a lack of financial support, which may hinder the progress of a project, but it does not necessarily explain why it is difficult to develop."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said that he was infected by the single-celled protozoan parasite. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom got trichomoniasis. (B) The water in the pond where Tom swam was contaminated by a special kind of bacteria.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom got trichomoniasis.\nExplanation: Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a single-celled protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. It is not caused by contaminated water in a pond. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ions have net charges. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ions are the same as atoms. (B) Ions are different from atoms.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Ions are different from atoms.\n\nExplanation: Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons, resulting in a net positive or negative charge. This means that ions have a different number of electrons than their corresponding neutral atoms, making them different from atoms."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a veteran. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He works much harder than his soldier time. (B) He needs proper treatment to secure his health.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: As a veteran, Tom may have experienced physical and mental trauma during his time in service. This can lead to long-term health issues that require proper treatment and care. It is important for veterans to receive the necessary support and resources to maintain their health and well-being. While some veterans may work harder than their soldier time, this is not necessarily a direct result of their veteran status."}}
{"Q": "They use bread from the planet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Human beings need nutritious food for their survival. (B) There are heterotrophs on that planet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There are heterotrophs on that planet.\nExplanation: Heterotrophs are organisms that cannot produce their own food and rely on consuming other organisms for their nutrition. If there are heterotrophs on the planet, it is likely that they consume some form of plant or animal life, which could include bread made from plant-based ingredients. Therefore, the use of bread from the planet could be a result of the need to provide food for these heterotrophs, rather than solely for human survival."}}
{"Q": "This branch grew well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He implanted a branch of another tree in this trunk. (B) The farmer has splited some alars into the garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is B, as splitting alars (which are likely apple trees) into the garden would provide a source of nutrients and favorable growing conditions for the branch to thrive. Implanting a branch of another tree in the trunk (option A) is not a common or practical method of growing a branch, and may not even be possible depending on the type of tree."}}
{"Q": "Tom has bought a lot of fruits in yellow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His mother told him that these fruits are guavas. (B) People can't buy fruits.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His mother told him that these fruits are guavas.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is a logical consequence of Tom buying a lot of yellow fruits. If Tom's mother saw the fruits, she may have recognized them as guavas and informed him of their name. On the other hand, option B is not a likely outcome as it does not make sense for people to be unable to buy fruits just because Tom bought a lot of yellow ones."}}
{"Q": "Animals and plants breathe in gases. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Animals and plants need to breathe to survive. (B) Strontium disappers from the earth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Animals and plants need to breathe to survive.\nExplanation: Animals and plants require oxygen for respiration, which is the process of converting food into energy. Oxygen is obtained through breathing, and carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. This exchange of gases is essential for the survival of animals and plants. Strontium has no direct relation to the breathing process of animals and plants."}}
{"Q": "The property called the police. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There were several burglaries in this neighborhood. (B) The police actively catch the criminal murderers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There were several burglaries in this neighborhood.\nExplanation: The fact that the property called the police suggests that there was some kind of criminal activity or threat in the area. Option A, which mentions several burglaries in the neighborhood, is a more plausible reason for the property to call the police than option B, which talks about catching criminal murderers."}}
{"Q": "Night was deep. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Today they've been eaten by yellowtail fishing. (B) Cockroaches came out for food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Cockroaches came out for food.\nExplanation: Cockroaches are nocturnal insects that are active during the night. As the night gets deeper, they come out in search of food. This is a common occurrence in many places, especially in urban areas where cockroaches thrive in the dark and damp corners of buildings. On the other hand, the first choice about being eaten by yellowtail fishing seems unlikely and out of context, making option B the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The chain lost some of its producers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Autotrophs in this food chain all dissappeared. (B) Tom died.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The Autotrophs in this food chain all disappeared.\nExplanation: Autotrophs are the primary producers in a food chain, and they are responsible for converting sunlight into energy that can be used by other organisms. If the autotrophs disappear, then the entire food chain will collapse because there will be no source of energy for the other organisms. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests that the loss of producers was due to the death of one individual, which would not have such a significant impact on the entire food chain."}}
{"Q": "The experimenter made an observation at the lower troposphere. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found many snakes hiding there. (B) He discovered the smog.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He discovered the smog.\nExplanation: The lower troposphere is the layer of the atmosphere closest to the Earth's surface, where most of the air pollution occurs. Therefore, it is more likely that the experimenter discovered the presence of smog rather than finding many snakes hiding there."}}
{"Q": "Sam ate too much and felt bloated in his stomach. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam has been burping. (B) Sam needed to seek advice from his friends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sam has been burping.\nExplanation: When someone eats too much, their stomach becomes full and bloated. This can cause the person to burp as their body tries to release the excess gas that has built up in their stomach. Seeking advice from friends is not a likely result of feeling bloated after eating too much."}}
{"Q": "Tom bit his lower lip with his front teeth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fortuneteller told Tom he had freckles. (B) He made the pronunciation of \"f\".", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He made the pronunciation of \"f\".\nExplanation: When Tom bit his lower lip with his front teeth, it caused his upper teeth to come into contact with his lower lip, creating a slight obstruction in the airflow through his mouth. This obstruction is similar to the one created when pronouncing the sound \"f\", which requires the upper teeth to touch the lower lip. Therefore, it is plausible that Tom unintentionally made the pronunciation of \"f\" when he bit his lower lip with his front teeth."}}
{"Q": "Sloths still walk the slowest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Twenty years have passed since the massacre. (B) Put the sloth and the rabbit together.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Sloths have evolved to move slowly due to their diet and lifestyle. They have a low metabolism and spend most of their time hanging upside down in trees, conserving energy. This slow movement also helps them avoid predators. Comparing them to a fast animal like a rabbit emphasizes their slow speed, but it is not related to a massacre that happened 20 years ago."}}
{"Q": "He is not likely to see weasels. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom usually goes out in the daytime. (B) Tom always eat apples with their peel.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom usually goes out in the daytime.\nExplanation: Weasels are nocturnal animals, meaning they are active at night. If Tom usually goes out during the daytime, it is unlikely that he will see weasels. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, is irrelevant to the sighting of weasels."}}
{"Q": "His new friends went to his hometown and observed it interestedly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John traveled in a great environment. (B) Mario described his hometown to his new friends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Mario described his hometown to his new friends.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the new friends were interested in the hometown because they observed it interestedly. This implies that they had some prior knowledge or information about the place, which is likely to have come from Mario's description. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not relevant to the given sentence and does not explain why the friends were interested in the hometown."}}
{"Q": "This horror film tells the story of innocent girls buried alive by ignorant villagers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Emily suffers from dermatosis because of watching this horror movies. (B) Emily suffers from tsunamis because of watching this horror movies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Emily suffers from dermatosis because of watching this horror movie.\nExplanation: The plot of the horror film suggests that innocent girls were buried alive by ignorant villagers. This storyline may cause fear and anxiety in some viewers, but it is unlikely to cause tsunamis. However, prolonged exposure to horror movies can cause stress-related skin conditions such as dermatosis. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John explored the altitude variation of swamp. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found very high topographic relief. (B) He found very low topographic relief.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He found very low topographic relief.\nExplanation: Swamps are typically low-lying areas with little variation in altitude. Therefore, it is more plausible that John found very low topographic relief rather than very high."}}
{"Q": "Biologists study everything related to biology. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dysprosium is one of their study objects. (B) Biologists never study anything about dysprosium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Just because biologists study everything related to biology, it does not mean that they study everything in the world. Dysprosium is a rare earth element and is not directly related to biology, so it is unlikely that biologists would study it. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man left the sediment of wine for him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This boy loves lees. (B) This boy loves wine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. This boy loves wine.\nExplanation: The sediment of wine, also known as lees, is not typically something that people enjoy consuming on its own. Therefore, it is more likely that the man left the sediment of wine for the boy because he knew the boy enjoyed wine and wanted to give him a gift or share his own wine with him."}}
{"Q": "He kept many waterfowls. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He fed them with the same food everyday. (B) He prepared different foods for them everyday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He prepared different foods for them everyday.\nExplanation: Keeping waterfowls requires a varied diet to ensure their health and well-being. Feeding them the same food every day can lead to nutritional deficiencies and health problems. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person prepared different foods for them every day to meet their dietary needs."}}
{"Q": "He was incarcerated in the state prison. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is guilty of rape and murder. (B) He applied to the personnel department.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence \"He was incarcerated in the state prison\" implies that Tom was sent to prison as a punishment for a crime he committed. Option A states that he is guilty of rape and murder, which are serious crimes that can result in imprisonment. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the context and does not provide a plausible reason for Tom's incarceration."}}
{"Q": "Tom's heart beat again. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to borrow a loan from the bank. (B) Defibrillation was applied to resuscitate Tom whose heart nearly stopped.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Defibrillation was applied to resuscitate Tom whose heart nearly stopped.\nExplanation: Defibrillation is a medical procedure that delivers an electric shock to the heart to restore its normal rhythm. If Tom's heart nearly stopped, defibrillation could have been applied to resuscitate him, causing his heart to beat again. Option A, Tom wanting to borrow a loan from the bank, is not a plausible cause for Tom's heart to beat again."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a Chinese expatriate in Spain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom likes Spanish food very much. (B) Tom is not a Chinese citizen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom is not a Chinese citizen.\nExplanation: Being a Chinese expatriate in Spain means that Tom is a Chinese national who is living in Spain. It does not necessarily imply anything about his food preferences. However, it does imply that he is not a Spanish citizen, which is why option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jerry's rabbit is dead. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The veterinarian diagnoses that Jerry's rabbit is sick. (B) Lila was sitting under an apple tree.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the rabbit was sick and the veterinarian diagnosed it as such. This is a common cause of death in pets, and it is important for owners to take their pets to the vet regularly to ensure their health and well-being. Option B, Lila sitting under an apple tree, is not a plausible cause of the rabbit's death as it is unrelated and does not provide any logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "Ticks can detect the gas given off by these animals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are some colugos. (B) Ticks is sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Ticks are known to be sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals, as they use this sense to locate potential hosts for feeding. This ability allows them to detect the carbon dioxide and other gases given off by animals, which helps them to find a suitable host. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A, which mentions colugos, is not relevant to the question and does not provide a logical explanation for the tick's ability to detect animal gases."}}
{"Q": "The worker was cutting the wood. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gibbons are resting on the tree. (B) He gains a lot of cellulose.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: None of the given choices are plausible.\n\nExplanation: The question does not provide enough information to determine what happened as a result of the worker cutting the wood. Therefore, neither of the given choices are plausible."}}
{"Q": "The geography teacher was studying the location of the oceans. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They found it on a thinner, heavier crust. (B) They discovered that there are no seas on Earth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They found it on a thinner, heavier crust.\nExplanation: The location of the oceans is related to the Earth's crust, which is divided into oceanic and continental crust. The oceanic crust is thinner and denser than the continental crust, and it underlies the oceans. Therefore, it is plausible that the geography teacher found that the oceans are located on a thinner, heavier crust. Option B is not a plausible answer as it contradicts the well-known fact that Earth has several seas and oceans."}}
{"Q": "Maria is very generous. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She can create fine jewelry. (B) She is willing to keep connect with others.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She is willing to keep connect with others.\nExplanation: Being generous means being willing to give to others, whether it be time, money, or resources. This often leads to building strong connections with others, as people appreciate and remember acts of generosity. Therefore, it is more plausible that Maria's generosity would result in her being willing to keep in touch with others, rather than suddenly gaining the ability to create fine jewelry."}}
{"Q": "The doctor gave Lucy the same stethoscope she had given to Tom who had a cold. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She refused the treatment. (B) Lucy has a cold.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Lucy has a cold.\nExplanation: It is possible that Lucy contracted the cold virus from using the same stethoscope as Tom, as the virus can survive on surfaces for a period of time. Therefore, it is plausible that Lucy has a cold as a result of using the same stethoscope as Tom."}}
{"Q": "He always studes about occult. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is a person filled with occultism. (B) Tom is a student majoring in metrology.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom always studies about occult suggests that he has a strong interest in the subject. Option A, which states that Tom is a person filled with occultism, is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests that Tom is a student majoring in metrology, a field that has nothing to do with occultism."}}
{"Q": "He was not a trained professional in that field. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom did not have preparation. (B) The pharmacist only had a fake degree.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom did not have preparation.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Tom simply did not have the necessary education or training in that particular field. It is more likely that he lacked preparation rather than the pharmacist having a fake degree, which would be a rare occurrence and require more evidence to support."}}
{"Q": "Tom is an experienced doctor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Patients trust Tom. (B) His violets only bloom in autumn.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Patients trust Tom.\nExplanation: Tom's experience as a doctor would have given him the knowledge and skills necessary to provide quality medical care to his patients. As a result, his patients would have developed trust in him and his abilities, leading to better patient-doctor relationships and improved health outcomes. On the other hand, option B is unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the given information."}}
{"Q": "Alice suffers from claustrophobia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She fears to taking the elevator. (B) To help him, he put a flower, lavender, under his pillow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She fears taking the elevator.\nExplanation: Claustrophobia is the fear of enclosed spaces. Therefore, it is more plausible that Alice would fear taking the elevator, which is an enclosed space, rather than someone putting a flower under their pillow to help her."}}
{"Q": "The experimenter found that the data conclusion was the same as the speed of light. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The student majoring in physics has measured theresistance of each part. (B) The experimenter is testing the speed at which electric energy comes down the metal ladder.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The cause of the data conclusion being the same as the speed of light is likely due to the experimenter testing the speed at which electric energy comes down the metal ladder. This suggests that the experiment was likely measuring the speed of electromagnetic waves, which travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. The resistance of each part, as measured by a student majoring in physics, would not necessarily be related to the speed of light."}}
{"Q": "Mary saw its unsual teeth. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He ate a whole cantaloupe. (B) Mary saw the colugo open its mouth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that Mary saw the colugo open its mouth, revealing its unusual teeth. Option A, that the colugo ate a whole cantaloupe, is unlikely as colugos are herbivores and do not typically eat cantaloupes."}}
{"Q": "John had his joint dislocated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The joint effusion inside has fast diffusion pathways. (B) Tom's tooth was avulsed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The joint effusion inside has fast diffusion pathways.\nExplanation: When a joint is dislocated, the ligaments and other structures that hold the joint in place are stretched or torn, causing the joint to move out of its normal position. This can result in damage to the joint capsule and surrounding tissues, leading to the accumulation of fluid (joint effusion) inside the joint. The fast diffusion pathways in the joint effusion allow for rapid exchange of nutrients and waste products between the joint and surrounding tissues, which can help to promote healing and reduce inflammation. In contrast, option B (Tom's tooth was avulsed) is not related to joint dislocation and is therefore an unlikely answer."}}
{"Q": "The princess wanted the flowers in all minerals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her follower brought her gems. (B) She booked a ticket of a zoo.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Her follower brought her gems.\nExplanation: Since the princess wanted flowers in all minerals, it is not possible to find flowers in all minerals as minerals are inorganic substances. Therefore, her follower might have brought her gems which are minerals and can be cut and polished to resemble flowers. This is a more plausible answer as booking a ticket of a zoo has no relevance to the princess's request for flowers in all minerals."}}
{"Q": "Societies have legislations. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Societies can preserve these genetic codes generation by generation. (B) They've had problems.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They've had problems.\nExplanation: While legislations are put in place to regulate and maintain order in societies, they are not foolproof and can still have flaws or loopholes that can lead to problems. Additionally, enforcing legislations can also be a challenge, as not everyone may agree with them or follow them. Therefore, it is more plausible that societies have had problems as a result of legislations rather than being able to preserve genetic codes generation by generation."}}
{"Q": "Testers test the toxicity of manganese compounds. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Among them the researcher found the toxic oxidants. (B) Test showed that permanganates is the highest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Test showed that permanganates is the highest.\nExplanation: Based on the given information, testers conducted tests to determine the toxicity of manganese compounds. The result of the test showed that permanganates had the highest toxicity level among the tested compounds. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A is not a relevant answer as it does not provide any information related to the toxicity level of manganese compounds."}}
{"Q": "He found the sunflwer will change its direction with the change of the sun's direction. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has grown a sunflower in his garden. (B) Tom observed the sun through a microscope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has grown a sunflower in his garden.\nExplanation: Sunflowers are known for their ability to track the movement of the sun, a phenomenon called heliotropism. This is due to a growth hormone called auxin, which is produced in the stem of the sunflower and causes it to grow more on the shaded side, thus bending the flower towards the sun. Tom's observation is likely a result of him growing a sunflower in his garden and observing its natural behavior. Option B, observing the sun through a microscope, is not relevant to the behavior of the sunflower."}}
{"Q": "Tom cheated Jane's money by lying. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He never eats junk food or any other unhealthy food. (B) Jane was heartbroken when finding Tom's lies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jane was heartbroken when finding Tom's lies.\nExplanation: Tom's cheating and lying would have caused Jane emotional distress and broken her trust in him. It is unlikely that Tom's eating habits would have any direct correlation with the situation. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Cannibalism seems to have been acceptable in the earliest times. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Prevalent phenomena are usually acceptable at that time. (B) Spiny coats can hurt fingers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Prevalent phenomena are usually acceptable at that time.\nExplanation: In the earliest times, humans were hunter-gatherers and often faced food scarcity. Cannibalism may have been a way to survive during times of famine or war. Additionally, cultural norms and beliefs may have played a role in accepting cannibalism as a practice. It is important to note that cannibalism is not universally accepted and is considered taboo in many cultures today."}}
{"Q": "I close the windows in advance so that the thunders won't scare me. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I know there will be some lightings tonight. (B) I am sitting in the library.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The speaker mentions thunder, which is often accompanied by lightning. By closing the windows in advance, the speaker is likely trying to avoid being startled by the loud noise of thunder and the bright flashes of lightning. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker knows there will be some lightning tonight, rather than sitting in a library, which is not directly related to the fear of thunder."}}
{"Q": "Tom often has a sore throat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom gets a fever. (B) Tom is an orator.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom is an orator.\nExplanation: Orators often strain their vocal cords by speaking loudly and for extended periods of time, which can lead to a sore throat. This is a more plausible explanation than choice A, as having a fever is not necessarily related to having a sore throat."}}
{"Q": "He fell ill. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is going to date with his beloved girl. (B) He has overworked himself.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He has overworked himself.\nExplanation: Overworking oneself can lead to exhaustion and weakened immune system, making one more susceptible to illnesses. This is a more plausible cause of falling ill compared to going on a date with a beloved girl, which is unlikely to cause illness."}}
{"Q": "There are some mites on the skin of poultry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The poultry was injured. (B) Tom did an exfoliation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The poultry was injured.\nExplanation: Mites are parasitic organisms that feed on the blood of their host, in this case, the poultry. As they feed, they can cause irritation, inflammation, and even damage to the skin of the poultry. This can lead to injuries such as scabs, lesions, and feather loss. Therefore, it is more plausible that the presence of mites on the skin of poultry would result in injury rather than someone doing an exfoliation."}}
{"Q": "Tons of insects will be eaten. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is planning to make a feast. (B) Microbats come out at night looking for food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Microbats are known to feed on insects, and they are active at night when insects are also active. Therefore, it is more plausible that the tons of insects will be eaten by microbats rather than Tom planning to make a feast."}}
{"Q": "Tom has curly hair. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's son has curly hair. (B) His parents prepared some ginger for him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom's son has curly hair.\nExplanation: Curly hair is a genetic trait that can be passed down from parents to their offspring. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's son inherited his curly hair rather than his parents preparing ginger for him as a result of his curly hair."}}
{"Q": "Doctors explain that the incidence rate of AIDS is increasing recently. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many people get AIDS every year. (B) The number of existing cases of this virus has been great in last month.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The cause of the increasing incidence rate of AIDS is likely due to the fact that many people are getting infected with the virus every year. This could be due to a variety of factors such as lack of education about safe sex practices, limited access to healthcare and testing, and stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS. It is important for individuals to take preventative measures such as using condoms and getting tested regularly to help decrease the spread of the virus."}}
{"Q": "Stundents wanted to know which was the least abundant of the naturally occurring rare earth element. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher told them it was thulium. (B) Their study conclude promethium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The teacher told them it was thulium.\n\nExplanation: Thulium is actually the least abundant of the naturally occurring rare earth elements, so it would be a correct answer to the students' question. It is more likely that the teacher would provide this information rather than the students concluding it themselves, as determining the abundance of rare earth elements requires specialized knowledge and equipment. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The seller recommends him an apartment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants a house where he can dry his clothes. (B) The specialist was unemployed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The reason for the seller recommending an apartment is because Tom wants a house where he can dry his clothes. This implies that Tom is looking for a place with a balcony or a designated area where he can hang his clothes to dry. The fact that the specialist was unemployed is irrelevant to the situation and does not explain why the seller recommended an apartment."}}
{"Q": "The wind is too strong. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Trees are blown down by wind. (B) It has difficulty in flying.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Trees are blown down by wind.\nExplanation: When the wind is too strong, it can cause trees to be uprooted or their branches to break off. This is a common occurrence during severe storms or hurricanes. On the other hand, option B is not as plausible as it suggests that the wind is affecting a specific object (such as a bird) rather than having a more widespread impact on the environment."}}
{"Q": "The United States is a capitalist country. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The vast majority of officials in its government are men. (B) Its society advocates private ownership.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Its society advocates private ownership.\nExplanation: Capitalism is an economic system that emphasizes private ownership of the means of production and distribution of goods and services. As a result, in a capitalist country like the United States, private ownership is highly valued and encouraged. This means that individuals and businesses have the right to own property, make their own economic decisions, and compete in the marketplace. While the gender makeup of government officials may be influenced by a variety of factors, it is not directly related to the economic system of capitalism."}}
{"Q": "People can read a total of my travel experience. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wrote a book of tourism. (B) Lucy has more ideas than Tom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is A, as writing a book of tourism would be a logical reason for people to read about someone's travel experiences. Option B, which mentions Lucy and Tom, is irrelevant and does not provide a logical explanation for why people would read about someone's travel experience."}}
{"Q": "George is cleaning his room. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found many snakes hiding there. (B) He sneezes from time to time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He sneezes from time to time.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that George would experience some dust or allergens while cleaning his room, which could cause him to sneeze from time to time. Finding many snakes hiding in his room is less likely and would be a more unexpected outcome."}}
{"Q": "The results showed that the wallaby were the right animal. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom searched the Internet for unique little megapods. (B) Tom searched the Internet for flying animals.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom searched the Internet for unique little megapods.\nExplanation: The word \"wallaby\" suggests that Tom was looking for a type of marsupial, which is a unique little megapod. Searching for flying animals, as in option B, would not necessarily lead to the discovery of wallabies as they are not known for their flying abilities. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor extracted some from nerve fibers in follicle walls surrounding oocytes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The treatment needs Serotonin. (B) The experimenter wants to extract some barium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The treatment needs Serotonin.\nExplanation: Nerve fibers are responsible for transmitting signals between cells, and serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating mood, appetite, and other physiological processes. It is possible that the doctor is extracting nerve fibers to obtain serotonin for a treatment that requires it. On the other hand, barium is a heavy metal that is not typically found in nerve fibers or follicle walls, so option B is unlikely."}}
{"Q": "Tom's family grows buckeyes and chestnut trees. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They have a lot in common. (B) It uses wood as its raw material.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They have a lot in common.\nExplanation: Buckeyes and chestnut trees are both types of deciduous trees that produce nuts. They also have similar growing requirements, such as needing well-drained soil and full sun. Therefore, it is likely that Tom's family has found that these two types of trees have a lot in common in terms of how they are grown and cared for."}}
{"Q": "He cut down the trunk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack cut off the roots of the plant. (B) The worker has found a rowan.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Cutting down the trunk of a plant usually requires cutting off the roots first. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack cut off the roots of the plant before cutting down the trunk. Option B, which suggests that the worker found a rowan, does not provide a clear reason for cutting down the trunk."}}
{"Q": "The curtain factory ran out of materials. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) These products didn't function as they used to do. (B) It couldn't produce any curtain.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It couldn't produce any curtain.\nExplanation: If the curtain factory ran out of materials, it wouldn't be able to produce any curtains until it restocked its supplies. Option A doesn't make sense as the question doesn't mention any existing products that would be affected by the lack of materials."}}
{"Q": "He began to examine east asian success. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's colleagues and boss treat him nicely and respect him as himself in the new company. (B) Tom joined in the team of the Economists.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Tom joined in the team of the Economists.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tom's examination of East Asian success was a result of his involvement in the team of Economists, as they would be more likely to study and analyze economic trends and successes in different regions. Tom's colleagues and boss treating him nicely would not necessarily lead to him examining East Asian success."}}
{"Q": "The farmed stayed and waited for spring. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Spiny coats can hurt fingers. (B) A heavy rain can revive the farm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) A heavy rain can revive the farm.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions waiting for spring, which is typically associated with the arrival of rain and warmer weather. Option (A) about spiny coats hurting fingers is not relevant to the context, and there is no indication in the sentence that the farm has been damaged or needs to be revived. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer as it suggests that the farm needs rain to thrive."}}
{"Q": "Jack ate comfrey by mistake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Then he had rashes on his skin. (B) He was poisoned.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Then he had rashes on his skin.\nExplanation: Comfrey is a plant that contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which can cause liver damage and other serious health problems if ingested in large amounts. However, in small amounts, it can cause skin irritation and rashes. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack experienced skin rashes as a result of eating comfrey by mistake, rather than being poisoned."}}
{"Q": "He found that it had a haploid nuclei. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He studied the origin of equations. (B) The teacher observed the mycelium under the microscope.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The observation of the mycelium under the microscope led to the discovery of the haploid nuclei. The haploid nuclei could have been a result of sexual reproduction or a mutation in the genetic material. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact cause of the haploid nuclei."}}
{"Q": "My mom had a headache. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She has to absorb water every once in a while. (B) I treated her with aromatherapy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If the mom had a headache, it is more plausible that her child would try to treat her with aromatherapy, rather than her needing to absorb water every once in a while. Aromatherapy is a common home remedy for headaches and can help alleviate symptoms."}}
{"Q": "His mother bought an electric mixer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to made some cider. (B) Tom likes to drink smoothies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: The fact that Tom's mother bought an electric mixer suggests that she did so to make smoothies or other blended drinks, which is a more common use for an electric mixer than making cider. While it's possible that Tom may have expressed an interest in making cider, this is not necessarily the most likely reason for his mother's purchase."}}
{"Q": "Jack wants to eat risotto. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He went to buy rice and meat. (B) He went to buy some fruit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He went to buy rice and meat.\nExplanation: Since Jack wants to eat risotto, which is a dish made with rice and meat, it is more plausible that he would go to buy these ingredients rather than buying fruit, which is not typically used in risotto."}}
{"Q": "He added stipes later. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wrote a study on epiphytes. (B) Tom drew a blank American flag.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom drew a blank American flag.\nExplanation: The addition of stripes is a reference to the American flag, which traditionally has 13 stripes. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom added stripes to his drawing of the flag rather than writing a study on epiphytes, which is unrelated to the context."}}
{"Q": "It made a difference in its life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My company always meets the commitments made to customers. (B) The microbe has a spore-containing structure called capsule.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that something positive happened in the life of the subject, which implies that it had some interaction with a company or organization. Option A states that the company always meets its commitments to customers, which could have resulted in a positive experience for the subject. On the other hand, option B talks about a microbe's structure, which is unlikely to have any impact on the subject's life. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said his lungs were not healthy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom often smokes. (B) Tom smokes all the year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom often smokes.\nExplanation: Smoking is a major cause of lung damage and can lead to various respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's lung problems are caused by his smoking habit rather than just smoking all year. Additionally, the use of the word \"often\" suggests that Tom's smoking habit is frequent and may have been going on for a while, further increasing the likelihood that it is the cause of his lung issues."}}
{"Q": "They vary in size. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments. (B) Farmers plant a great number of heveas every year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The size variation is likely due to the fact that myofibrils, which are the contractile units of muscle cells, can have different numbers of myofilaments. Myofilaments are the protein structures that slide past each other during muscle contraction, and the number of myofilaments within a myofibril can affect its size. Therefore, it is more plausible that the variation in size is due to differences in myofilament numbers rather than farmers planting heveas (which are rubber trees and not related to muscle cells)."}}
{"Q": "It is a leech. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An eight-inch-long creature is attaching to Tom's leg and sucking blood. (B) An 18-inch-long creature is attaching to Tom's leg and sucking blood.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Leeches are typically small creatures, usually only a few inches long. While there are some species of leeches that can grow up to 18 inches long, it is much more likely that the leech in this scenario is only eight inches long. Additionally, an eight-inch-long leech would still be large enough to cause concern and discomfort for Tom, making it a plausible explanation for the situation."}}
{"Q": "I advised my son to be an internist. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My father is an evolutionist. (B) I think specialists in internal medicine are helpful.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (B) because the statement suggests that the reason for advising the son to become an internist is that the speaker believes that specialists in internal medicine are helpful. There is no connection between the father being an evolutionist and the son becoming an internist, so (A) is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "An animal ate a yew leaf. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The animal was poisoned. (B) He has a stomachache.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The animal was poisoned.\nExplanation: Yew leaves contain a toxic substance called taxine, which can cause severe poisoning in animals if ingested. Symptoms of yew poisoning in animals include vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, seizures, and even death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the animal was poisoned rather than just having a stomachache after eating a yew leaf."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said that deleterious but variable consequence is fibrosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary's doctor told her that she needed flavonoids to treat her illness. (B) She suffers from chronic inflammation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She suffers from chronic inflammation.\nExplanation: Fibrosis is a condition where there is an excessive accumulation of fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue, leading to scarring and loss of function. Chronic inflammation is a known cause of fibrosis, as the body's immune response to the inflammation can lead to the deposition of excess connective tissue. Flavonoids, while they may have some anti-inflammatory properties, are not a direct treatment for fibrosis. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They need to build a furnace. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) But paramecium is an exception. (B) They brought a boiler firstly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Building a furnace requires specific materials and construction techniques, so it is unlikely that the result would be that paramecium is an exception. Option B is more plausible because it suggests that the builders made a mistake by bringing a boiler instead of a furnace, which could lead to further complications or delays in the construction process."}}
{"Q": "The patient improved with tears. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor told the patient that crying was not a bad thing. (B) Tom suffered from the lung cancer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the patient improved with tears because they were able to release their emotions and feel a sense of relief, possibly due to the fact that they were suffering from a serious illness such as lung cancer. Crying can be a natural and healthy way to cope with difficult emotions and situations. Option A may be a helpful suggestion from a doctor, but it is unlikely to be the sole cause of the patient's improvement."}}
{"Q": "He looked for manuals of the phone. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted to know how to use the smartphone. (B) Tom wanted to know how to sell the smartphone.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom wanted to know how to use the smartphone.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom was looking for manuals of the phone suggests that he was trying to learn how to use it. If he wanted to sell the phone, he would not need the manuals as he would not be using the phone himself. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This student suffers from nearsightedness. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly. (B) Soon his vision began to suffer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is a condition where a person can see nearby objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Therefore, the student with nearsightedness would have difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly, but there is no evidence to suggest that their vision would soon begin to suffer."}}
{"Q": "This crop field is always very cold due to frost. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The owner of this field build green houses. (B) The owner of this field build an animal farm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The owner of this field build green houses.\nExplanation: Greenhouses are structures that can regulate temperature and protect crops from frost. It is a more plausible solution than building an animal farm, which may not necessarily address the issue of frost affecting the crops. Therefore, building greenhouses would be a more logical solution to protect the crops from the cold."}}
{"Q": "A glaucoma patient asked the doctor about the cause. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor performed a heart operation on the patient. (B) The doctor said it was because the drainage outlet was blocked and the internal pressure increased.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The doctor's response in option B is more plausible as it explains the cause of glaucoma, which is an increase in internal pressure due to a blocked drainage outlet. Option A, on the other hand, is not related to the question and seems like an unlikely response from a doctor."}}
{"Q": "Flying insects affect people's rest at night in summer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People are praying for more corns this year. (B) People are praying for more bats this year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) People are praying for more bats this year.\nExplanation: Bats are natural predators of flying insects and can help control their population. By praying for more bats, people are hoping to reduce the number of flying insects that disturb their rest at night in summer. This is a more plausible answer than praying for more corns, which is unrelated to the issue of flying insects."}}
{"Q": "Tom has been practicing table tennis since he was a boy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's body is getting stronger and stronger. (B) Later, he became an Olympic champion of table tennis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Later, he became an Olympic champion of table tennis.\n\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's years of practice and dedication to table tennis would lead to him becoming an Olympic champion in the sport, rather than just his body getting stronger. Becoming an Olympic champion requires not only physical strength but also exceptional skill and strategy, which can only be achieved through years of practice and experience."}}
{"Q": "The boss tried to calculate the cost of the company this month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The accountant told the boss that don't forget to take the benefits into account. (B) The boss suspected that someone had misappropriated company funds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the accountant reminded the boss to take the benefits into account when calculating the cost of the company this month. This is a common practice in accounting to ensure that all expenses are properly accounted for. On the other hand, there is no indication in the question that suggests that someone had misappropriated company funds."}}
{"Q": "The results of the study showed that it was the interstitial cells. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) DAG failed in the R-cells. (B) Scientists are studying between which cells the sperm is produced.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. DAG failed in the R-cells.\nExplanation: DAG (diacylglycerol) is a signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in the production of sperm in the testes. It activates protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn stimulates the interstitial cells to produce testosterone, a hormone necessary for sperm production. If DAG fails to activate PKC in the R-cells (cells that produce DAG), then the interstitial cells will not produce enough testosterone, leading to a decrease in sperm production. Therefore, it is plausible that the failure of DAG in the R-cells caused the interstitial cells to be responsible for sperm production."}}
{"Q": "He opened the refrigerator door. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The rich boy wanted to see the sample. (B) Jack want to eat ham.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Jack wanted to eat ham, as opening the refrigerator door is a common action taken when looking for food or drinks. Option A, that the rich boy wanted to see the sample, is not a likely cause for opening the refrigerator door as it is unclear what sample is being referred to and why it would be in the refrigerator."}}
{"Q": "Scientists detect the acidity and alkalinity of volcanism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists invented echolocation system. (B) Scientists have detected different pH values from 0 to 12.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Scientists have developed methods to detect the pH values of volcanic activity, ranging from highly acidic to highly alkaline. This has allowed for a better understanding of the chemical composition and behavior of volcanic eruptions, which can aid in predicting and mitigating their potential hazards. However, this development does not relate to the invention of an echolocation system, which is a completely different technology used for detecting objects through sound waves."}}
{"Q": "Tourist hiked for 3 hours. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) All of them sweated a lot. (B) They made observations on the mountain during the day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They made observations on the mountain during the day.\nExplanation: It is more likely that tourists would make observations during a 3-hour hike rather than just sweating a lot. Hiking provides an opportunity to observe the surroundings and appreciate the natural beauty of the area. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mitochondria in the cell were divided into two. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They developed in this way. (B) It began to construct earthen cells.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They developed in this way.\nExplanation: Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. When a cell divides, the mitochondria also divide and are distributed between the two daughter cells. This process ensures that each new cell has the necessary energy-producing organelles to carry out its functions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the mitochondria would develop in this way rather than constructing earthen cells, which is not a known function of mitochondria."}}
{"Q": "The sheep was killed by the lions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sheep must be a prey in those lions. (B) The shepherd's sheep ran into the orchard by mistake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The sheep must be a prey in those lions.\nExplanation: Lions are predators and they hunt for their food. It is natural for them to kill and eat prey animals like sheep. Therefore, it is more plausible that the sheep was killed by the lions because it was their prey, rather than it accidentally running into an orchard."}}
{"Q": "The apple is rotten. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tm has found a chinchilla in the mountain. (B) He threw a whole apple into the warm and humid garbage dump.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (B) because throwing a whole apple into a warm and humid garbage dump can cause it to rot due to the presence of bacteria and other microorganisms that thrive in such conditions. On the other hand, finding a chinchilla in the mountain (A) has no direct correlation with the apple being rotten."}}
{"Q": "The cops replied, \"Small children.'. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) No creatures could infected by the flytraps. (B) He asked the cops what they had seen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He asked the cops what they had seen.\n\nExplanation: The given statement does not provide any context or background information to determine the cause of the cops' reply. However, the word \"replied\" suggests that the person asking the question had already asked something. Therefore, option B seems more plausible as it suggests that the person had asked the cops what they had seen, and the cops replied that they had seen small children. Option A is not related to the given statement and does not provide any explanation for the cops' reply."}}
{"Q": "The school assumes the responsibility of taking care of the safety of students on campus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The school encourages students to bring knives to campus. (B) Teachers forbid the students to run around in the campus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Teachers forbid the students to run around in the campus.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the school would take measures to prevent accidents and injuries on campus, such as forbidding students from running around, rather than encouraging them to bring weapons. The school's responsibility for student safety would likely lead to stricter rules and regulations to ensure a safe learning environment."}}
{"Q": "This material is easy to bent. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The producer needs a special kind of material to make the kettle. (B) This material has excellent flexibility.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This material has excellent flexibility.\nExplanation: The statement \"this material is easy to bend\" suggests that the material has good flexibility. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it directly explains the cause of the material being easy to bend. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any explanation for the material's flexibility."}}
{"Q": "She becomes a vegetarian. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The lady wants to live a longer and healthier life. (B) She is a brave woman.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The lady wants to live a longer and healthier life.\nExplanation: Becoming a vegetarian is often associated with health benefits such as lower risk of heart disease, cancer, and other chronic illnesses. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lady became a vegetarian to improve her health and increase her lifespan rather than simply being brave."}}
{"Q": "These children's lives are full of happiness. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The teacher provided them with a variety of pedons. (B) The government and families strive to guarantee the underlying values of children.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The government and families strive to guarantee the underlying values of children.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the children's lives are full of happiness, which implies that they have a positive environment and upbringing. The teacher providing them with a variety of pedons (A) may contribute to their education and learning, but it does not necessarily guarantee happiness. On the other hand, the government and families striving to guarantee the underlying values of children (B) can create a supportive and nurturing environment that promotes happiness and well-being. This includes providing basic needs, such as food, shelter, and healthcare, as well as instilling values such as love, respect, and kindness. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He has to complete an optical design. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He uses mechanical instruments. (B) He uses optical instruments.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He uses optical instruments.\nExplanation: Since the task at hand is an optical design, it is more plausible that the person would use optical instruments to complete it. Mechanical instruments may not be suitable for this task as they are designed for mechanical measurements and not for optical measurements. Therefore, it is more likely that the person would use optical instruments to complete the design."}}
{"Q": "His mom bought him a cup pf yougurt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack had stomach cramps. (B) The child's intestinal gurgling needed some help.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Jack had stomach cramps, which could be relieved by consuming yogurt. Yogurt contains probiotics that can help improve digestion and alleviate stomach discomfort. On the other hand, option B is less likely as intestinal gurgling is a normal bodily function and does not necessarily require intervention."}}
{"Q": "Heis skin got a rash. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was exposed to some nickel. (B) Tom gets a fever.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was exposed to some nickel.\nExplanation: Nickel is a common cause of skin rashes and allergic reactions. It is often found in jewelry, coins, and other metal objects. If someone comes into contact with nickel and is allergic to it, they may develop a rash. On the other hand, Tom getting a fever is not related to the cause of the rash."}}
{"Q": "They stand still. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists put beryllium and iron together. (B) This tunner has time limitation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The given options suggest that the cause of them standing still is either a time limitation or scientists putting beryllium and iron together. However, option A seems more plausible as it suggests a chemical reaction between beryllium and iron, which could result in the formation of a compound that causes them to stand still. On the other hand, option B does not provide any logical explanation for why they would stand still due to a time limitation. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."}}
{"Q": "But we handled them sucessfully and made historical decelopment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There were no problems in China's economy during 1970s. (B) China's economy were faced with many problems during 1970s.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: China's economy faced many problems during the 1970s, including a lack of modern infrastructure, low productivity, and a shortage of foreign exchange. However, the Chinese government implemented various economic reforms, such as the opening up of the economy to foreign investment and the establishment of special economic zones, which helped to stimulate economic growth and development. Additionally, the government's emphasis on education and technological innovation also played a significant role in China's economic success. Therefore, it is more plausible to say that China's successful handling of economic problems during the 1970s was due to the government's proactive approach to reform and development."}}
{"Q": "Cactus stems can prick our fingers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Areoles on stems can protect our skin. (B) Areoles on stems can prick our skin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Areoles on stems can prick our skin.\nExplanation: Areoles are small, raised structures on cactus stems that contain spines or thorns. These spines are used by the cactus as a defense mechanism against predators and to protect the plant from damage. When we touch or brush against the areoles, the spines can easily penetrate our skin, causing pain and sometimes even injury. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The vet provided my dog with Adjuvants. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The veterinarian diagnosed that his dog had a gastrointestinal disease. (B) The stimulation of the appropriate protective immune response was boosted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The stimulation of the appropriate protective immune response was boosted.\nExplanation: Adjuvants are substances that are added to vaccines to enhance the body's immune response to the vaccine. They work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and respond to the vaccine more effectively. Therefore, it is more plausible that the adjuvants provided to the dog boosted the protective immune response rather than diagnosing a gastrointestinal disease."}}
{"Q": "Mr Li wanted to illustrate Enantiomers with examples. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He read about some examples. (B) He enumerated a pair of chemical substances.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Mr Li illustrated Enantiomers by enumerating a pair of chemical substances. Enantiomers are pairs of molecules that are mirror images of each other but cannot be superimposed on each other. A classic example of enantiomers is the amino acid alanine, which has two enantiomers: L-alanine and D-alanine. Mr Li may have used this example or others to illustrate the concept of enantiomers."}}
{"Q": "Tom ate Prednisone. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He then got dehydrated. (B) He has a stomachache.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He has a stomachache.\nExplanation: Prednisone is a steroid medication that is commonly used to treat inflammation and autoimmune disorders. However, it can also cause side effects such as stomach irritation, nausea, and vomiting. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom would experience a stomachache after taking Prednisone rather than becoming dehydrated."}}
{"Q": "There was pregnancy on this woman. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tests revealed that her placenta strongly stimulated progesterone. (B) A small baby was born in her family.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: If there was a pregnancy, it is more likely that a baby was born rather than tests revealing the stimulation of progesterone by the placenta. While progesterone is an important hormone during pregnancy, it is not the only factor that determines the outcome of a pregnancy. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "All cells in the cell culture medium die. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The circuit is closed. (B) The scientist injected the cytotoxin into the cell culture medium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the scientist injected a cytotoxin into the cell culture medium. Cytotoxins are substances that are toxic to cells and can cause cell death. If all cells in the cell culture medium died, it is likely that they were exposed to a cytotoxin. The circuit being closed would not necessarily cause cell death, as it would only affect the flow of electricity."}}
{"Q": "He would lead the chorus at every church service. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is the cardinal of this church. (B) The priest called all the Christians together.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The fact that he leads the chorus at every church service suggests that he is a regular member of the church choir or congregation, rather than a high-ranking official like a cardinal. Option B is more plausible as it suggests that the priest or church leader called all the Christians together for the service, and the man in question was a willing participant in the choir or congregation."}}
{"Q": "Lina inflates the balloon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The ballon flies away. (B) The ballon is heavier.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The balloon is heavier.\nExplanation: When Lina inflates the balloon, she is adding air to it, which increases its mass and therefore makes it heavier. The balloon is unlikely to fly away unless it is released or there is a strong gust of wind."}}
{"Q": "There is grass on alpine steppes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Yaks were fed on alpine steppes. (B) Chameleons can survive this long.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Yaks were fed on alpine steppes.\nExplanation: Alpine steppes are known for their grassy vegetation, which provides a food source for many grazing animals, including yaks. Chameleons, on the other hand, are not typically found in alpine environments and would not be able to survive in such harsh conditions. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The nurse loves taking care of patients. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She often saw their weakness. (B) He is fond with food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She often saw their weakness.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the nurse, who loves taking care of patients, would often see their weakness as she is constantly observing and monitoring their health. Option B, \"He is fond with food,\" is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the given statement."}}
{"Q": "Zoologists found a hyena. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After a while there were a lot of hyenas. (B) He tested its reflectivity for know its power.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. After a while there were a lot of hyenas.\nExplanation: If zoologists found a hyena, it is likely that they observed its behavior and habitat. If they found a breeding pair, or a group of hyenas, it is possible that they could reproduce and increase in number over time, leading to a population of hyenas in the area. Therefore, it is more plausible that after a while there were a lot of hyenas as a result of the zoologists' discovery. Option B, testing its reflectivity, does not make sense in the context of finding a hyena."}}
{"Q": "Tom spun the manure at high speeds with centrifuges. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A kind of Emulsion was produced. (B) The effect of gravity was increased.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Centrifugation is a process that separates components of a mixture based on their density. In this case, Tom used centrifuges to spin the manure at high speeds, which would cause the denser components to move towards the outside of the centrifuge and the less dense components to move towards the center. This would result in the production of an emulsion, which is a mixture of two immiscible liquids (in this case, water and manure) that are stabilized by an emulsifying agent. The effect of gravity would not be increased by centrifugation, as the force of gravity is constant and does not change during the process."}}
{"Q": "Biologists lower the firing threshold of limbic neuron circuits. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They found a lot of radium. (B) Biologists have discovered that dissociation has occurred.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (C) The limbic neuron circuits became more easily activated.\nExplanation: Lowering the firing threshold of neuron circuits means that it takes less stimulation for the neurons to fire and send signals. In the case of limbic neuron circuits, this could lead to increased activity in emotional and motivational processes, potentially affecting behavior and mood. The other choices (A and B) are not related to the given information and are not plausible answers."}}
{"Q": "John raised some chinchillas. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He classified them into five groups. (B) He kept the chinchillas locked up at night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John kept the chinchillas locked up at night as a result of raising them, as this is a common practice to ensure their safety and prevent them from escaping or being harmed by predators. Classifying them into five groups may also be a result of raising them, but it is less likely to be the immediate or practical outcome."}}
{"Q": "Mary prepared dinners for those boatmen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She cooked some vegetables. (B) They enjoyed the delicious food very much.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They enjoyed the delicious food very much.\nExplanation: Since Mary prepared dinners for the boatmen, it is likely that they ate the food she cooked. The fact that the sentence mentions Mary preparing dinners suggests that the boatmen were in need of food, and the fact that she prepared it for them implies that they did not have access to food at that time. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they would have enjoyed the food very much, as it would have satisfied their hunger."}}
{"Q": "The kid swallowed a piece of silver by accident. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wasn't poisoned. (B) He got toxic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He wasn't poisoned.\nExplanation: Swallowing a small piece of silver is unlikely to cause poisoning. The silver will pass through the digestive system and be eliminated in the stool. However, if the piece of silver was large or had sharp edges, it could cause injury to the digestive tract and require medical attention."}}
{"Q": "It has long-term and heavy rainfalls very often in summer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Higher precipitation was recorded this year. (B) This province have frequent flood each summer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. This province have frequent flood each summer.\nExplanation: Long-term and heavy rainfalls often lead to an increase in the water level of rivers and lakes, which can cause flooding in low-lying areas. Therefore, it is more plausible that this province would experience frequent floods each summer rather than just a higher precipitation record for the year."}}
{"Q": "He was amazed at the age and history of these stones. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John discovered some chondrites. (B) Archaeologists repair the ancient writing on the rocks.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Archaeologists repair the ancient writing on the rocks.\nExplanation: The statement mentions the age and history of the stones, which suggests that they have some kind of ancient writing or markings on them. The fact that the archaeologists are repairing the writing indicates that they are studying the stones for their historical significance, which would amaze someone who is interested in history. On the other hand, the discovery of chondrites (a type of meteorite) would not necessarily be related to the age and history of the stones, and would not necessarily cause amazement in someone interested in history. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He found meiosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His little finger was exsected. (B) He was watching the eukaryotes that were reproducing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He was watching the eukaryotes that were reproducing.\nExplanation: Meiosis is a process of cell division that occurs in eukaryotic cells during sexual reproduction. It involves the formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells) with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The process was first observed and described by the German biologist Oscar Hertwig in 1876 while he was studying the fertilization of sea urchin eggs. Therefore, it is more plausible that he discovered meiosis by observing eukaryotes that were reproducing rather than having his little finger exsected."}}
{"Q": "Stemosis intensified during flexion after that. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Logan's ligamentum flavum was stretched broken during flexion. (B) The Great Depression was a great economic collapse and chaos in America.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Stemosis is a condition where the spinal canal narrows, causing pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Flexion, or bending forward, can exacerbate this condition by further narrowing the spinal canal. Logan's ligamentum flavum is a structure that helps support the spinal column and can become stretched or even torn during flexion, contributing to the worsening of stemosis symptoms. The Great Depression, on the other hand, is a historical event that has no relevance to this medical condition."}}
{"Q": "Jack is good at applying extrapolation in the field of stock and finance. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack feels better. (B) By analyzing the economic curve before the stock market disaster in the past, he successfully predicted the financial crisis in 2008.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: By applying extrapolation in the field of stock and finance, Jack was able to analyze the economic curve before the stock market disaster in the past and successfully predicted the financial crisis in 2008. This shows that his skills in extrapolation have practical applications and can lead to significant financial gains or losses. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not relevant to the situation and does not provide any explanation of the consequences of Jack's skills in extrapolation."}}
{"Q": "The company took use of the way of telecommuting. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy doesn't need to go to the company any more. (B) Its usability was reduced.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy doesn't need to go to the company any more.\nExplanation: Telecommuting allows employees to work from home or other remote locations, reducing the need for them to physically come into the office. Therefore, it is plausible that Lucy no longer needs to go to the company if the company has implemented telecommuting. Option B, stating that the usability was reduced, does not make sense in this context as telecommuting is a way to increase usability and flexibility for employees."}}
{"Q": "Tom wanted to know what is the turbulent flow of air through the glottis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He measured with the unit of megahertz. (B) Finally he looked it up and he knew it was because of aspiration.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Tom looked up the concept of turbulent flow of air through the glottis and learned that it was caused by aspiration, which refers to the inhalation of foreign objects or substances into the respiratory tract. Measuring with the unit of megahertz is not relevant to this question and is therefore an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was guided to draw the dominant creature of agriculture in geography class. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom drew some cattle. (B) After consulting the data, he took burrow as an example.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. After consulting the data, he took burrow as an example.\nExplanation: Since the question mentions that Tom was guided to draw the dominant creature of agriculture in geography class, it is likely that he would have consulted some data or information before drawing. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would have chosen an animal that is commonly used in agriculture, such as a burrow, after researching and considering various options. Drawing cattle may also be a possibility, but it is less likely as the question does not provide any specific information about the type of agriculture or region being studied."}}
{"Q": "His instructor tells him to find the arrows followed and he will see the explanations. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mario clearly understands the definitions. (B) Mario can't understand some academic definitions in the online document.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The fact that Mario's instructor tells him to find the arrows followed and he will see the explanations suggests that Mario is having difficulty understanding some academic definitions in the online document. If Mario clearly understood the definitions, his instructor would not need to direct him to the arrows for further explanation."}}
{"Q": "My aunt found harmful levels of common bacteria in food. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Other enzymes in her body were activated. (B) She used Pasteurization to kill them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: If harmful levels of bacteria were found in the food, it is more likely that the aunt used Pasteurization to kill them. Pasteurization is a process of heating food to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time to kill harmful bacteria. Other enzymes in the body being activated would not be a direct result of finding harmful bacteria in food."}}
{"Q": "He went to wrestling. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was injured. (B) He soon suffered from depression.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was injured.\nExplanation: Wrestling is a contact sport that involves physical combat between two opponents. It is common for wrestlers to get injured during matches or training sessions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person in question got injured as a result of going to wrestling rather than suffering from depression."}}
{"Q": "The most hazardous chemicals in barns should be kept away from childs. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Childs are not allowed to use bags in the barns. (B) Childs are not allowed to touch disinfectants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Childs are not allowed to touch disinfectants.\nExplanation: To ensure the safety of children in barns, it is important to keep hazardous chemicals, such as disinfectants, away from them. Disinfectants can cause skin irritation, respiratory problems, and other health issues if ingested or inhaled. Therefore, it is more plausible that children are not allowed to touch disinfectants rather than not being allowed to use bags in the barns, which may not necessarily be related to the safety of hazardous chemicals."}}
{"Q": "He identified the location of hydroxyl. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom noticed the brightest radiation of all the thermostats. (B) Tom noticed the bleakest  radiation of all the thermostats.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom noticed the brightest radiation of all the thermostats.\n\nExplanation: Hydroxyl groups absorb radiation in the near-infrared region, causing a decrease in the intensity of the radiation. Therefore, if Tom noticed the brightest radiation of all the thermostats, it means that the hydroxyl group was not present in that location. Conversely, if he noticed the bleakest radiation, it would indicate the presence of a hydroxyl group. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He observed the early process of food decomposition. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He saw rapid leaching of carbohydrates. (B) He became experienced.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He saw rapid leaching of carbohydrates.\nExplanation: When food decomposes, the carbohydrates in it start to break down and leach out. This process can happen rapidly, especially in warm and moist conditions. Therefore, it is plausible that the observer saw this happening during the early stages of food decomposition. Option B, \"He became experienced,\" is not a likely result of observing food decomposition. While the observer may have gained some knowledge or understanding from the experience, it is not a direct result of what was observed."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said he had spondylolisthesis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor insert a pacemaker for him. (B) The test results showed that his upper vertebra is detached from the lower vertebra.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The test results showed that his upper vertebra is detached from the lower vertebra.\nExplanation: Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra in the spine slips out of place onto the vertebra below it. This can cause lower back pain and other symptoms. The most likely result of a diagnosis of spondylolisthesis would be that the test results showed that the upper vertebra is detached from the lower vertebra. Inserting a pacemaker would not be a relevant treatment for this condition."}}
{"Q": "The body needs six key nutrients to thrive. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It can live well. (B) Nutritionists suggest balanced food mix.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Nutritionists suggest balanced food mix.\nExplanation: The statement implies that in order for the body to thrive, it needs six key nutrients. Therefore, nutritionists suggest a balanced food mix that includes all six nutrients to ensure that the body receives the necessary nutrients to function properly. A balanced diet is essential for good health and well-being."}}
{"Q": "There is no paper in the printer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The printer can not work normally. (B) The printer can work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The printer can not work normally.\nExplanation: If there is no paper in the printer, it cannot print anything. The printer needs paper to be able to print documents or images. Therefore, without paper, the printer cannot work normally."}}
{"Q": "The United States uses anthrax as its main weapon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The United States launched a biological war against Japan. (B) There are many outlaws in the Middle East.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The statement is not accurate. The United States does not use anthrax as its main weapon. While the U.S. has researched and developed anthrax as a potential biological weapon, it has not been used as a primary weapon in any conflict. Additionally, the statement's suggestion that the use of anthrax is related to outlaws in the Middle East is not supported by any evidence."}}
{"Q": "Lucy believed that dinosaurs didn't possess teeth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her happiness disappeared. (B) Her belief was wrong.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Her belief was wrong.\nExplanation: Lucy's belief that dinosaurs didn't possess teeth was proven to be incorrect, as it is widely known that many species of dinosaurs did have teeth. Therefore, her belief was proven to be wrong."}}
{"Q": "This land was invaded. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Weeds swallowed this land. (B) The monster learned to cut its claws.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Weeds swallowed this land.\nExplanation: Weeds are known to be invasive species that can quickly take over an area and choke out native plants. If left unchecked, they can completely overtake a piece of land, making it difficult for anything else to grow or thrive. This is a more plausible explanation for the land being invaded than a monster suddenly learning to cut its claws."}}
{"Q": "The bulbils have bloomed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bulbils he raised have been growing for two years. (B) I planted bulbils to see their germination.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The bulbils he raised have been growing for two years.\nExplanation: Bulbils are small bulbs that grow on the stem of some plants, such as garlic and onion. They can be used to propagate new plants. It takes time for bulbils to grow and mature enough to produce flowers. Therefore, if the bulbils have bloomed, it is more likely that they have been growing for a while, such as two years, as stated in option A. Option B, planting bulbils to see their germination, does not necessarily lead to blooming, as it depends on the maturity of the bulbils and the growing conditions."}}
{"Q": "There has been no rain in the countryside for a month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was no phosphate precipitation of iron. (B) The farmer used a hose to draw water out of the well to water the crops.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The farmer used a hose to draw water out of the well to water the crops.\n\nExplanation: Without rain, the crops would not receive enough water to grow and thrive. Therefore, the farmer would need to find an alternative source of water to irrigate the crops. Using a hose to draw water out of a well is a common method of irrigation in areas where there is little rainfall. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it refers to a chemical process that is not directly related to the absence of rain."}}
{"Q": "Deltas are rich in natural fertilizer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researchers found ore. (B) Agriculture develops well in deltas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Agriculture develops well in deltas.\nExplanation: Deltas are formed by the deposition of sediment carried by rivers, which often contain nutrients and organic matter. This makes deltas rich in natural fertilizer, which is beneficial for agriculture. The nutrients in the soil help crops grow and produce higher yields, making agriculture a viable industry in delta regions. Therefore, it is more plausible that agriculture develops well in deltas due to their rich natural fertilizer. The option of researchers finding ore is not related to the presence of natural fertilizer in deltas."}}
{"Q": "He vomited and took in some toxins. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has picked up a meadowlark. (B) The woman had to feed her son with berries.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The woman had to feed her son with berries.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the toxins were ingested through the consumption of poisonous berries rather than picking up a meadowlark. Birds are not typically carriers of toxins that can cause vomiting in humans."}}
{"Q": "The scientist studies water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Some people learned how to make beers with top fermenting yeasts from him. (B) He is a hydrologist.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Since the scientist studies water, it is more plausible that he is a hydrologist, which is a scientist who studies the properties, distribution, and effects of water on the Earth's surface, in the soil and rocks, and in the atmosphere. Choice A, on the other hand, is not directly related to the study of water and seems like an unrelated fact."}}
{"Q": "He put into some tomatoes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to color his soup. (B) Tom has grown some seeds in his garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom has grown some seeds in his garden.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Tom has grown his own tomatoes and is using them in his cooking. Option A, on the other hand, seems less likely as coloring soup with tomatoes is not a common practice."}}
{"Q": "Jessy tried to use words to modify a noun and a verb. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She selected an adjective for noun and an adverb for verb. (B) She selected an adjective for verb and an adverb for noun.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She selected an adjective for noun and an adverb for verb.\n\nExplanation: This is the most common and correct way to modify a noun and a verb using words. Adjectives are used to modify nouns, while adverbs are used to modify verbs. For example, \"The beautiful flower bloomed quickly.\" In this sentence, \"beautiful\" is an adjective modifying the noun \"flower,\" and \"quickly\" is an adverb modifying the verb \"bloomed.\" Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She feels coolness in summer and warmth in winter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy lives by the side of Neoprene. (B) Amy lives by the side of Iceland.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Amy lives by the side of Iceland.\nExplanation: Iceland is known for its cool climate in summer and cold climate in winter due to its location near the Arctic Circle. Neoprene, on the other hand, is a synthetic rubber material and has no effect on the climate. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He quickly accepted the culture of eating sashimi. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has good cultural adaptability. (B) He went to a cllege.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He has good cultural adaptability.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person quickly accepted the culture of eating sashimi, which implies that he is open to new experiences and has the ability to adapt to different cultures. Going to college may expose a person to different cultures, but it does not necessarily mean that they will quickly accept and adapt to them. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's father was dignosed with the atherosclerosis many years ago. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It is very dangerous for her to have children at this age. (B) Lucy was diagnosed with atherosclerosis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Atherosclerosis is a condition where plaque builds up in the arteries, leading to a narrowing of the blood vessels and reduced blood flow. It is not a hereditary condition, so Lucy's father being diagnosed with atherosclerosis does not necessarily mean that Lucy will also develop the condition. However, it does increase her risk of developing atherosclerosis in the future, especially if she has other risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or a sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, it is important for Lucy to maintain a healthy lifestyle and monitor her cardiovascular health regularly. The statement about it being dangerous for her to have children at this age is unrelated to atherosclerosis and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom keeps the laborator at room temperature. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Hydrogen perxoide tends to be unstable here. (B) When the woman was newly pragnant, she suffered from the rubella virus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement about Tom keeping the laboratory at room temperature suggests that there is a need for a stable environment. Choice A provides a plausible reason for this, as hydrogen peroxide is known to be unstable at higher temperatures. On the other hand, choice B seems unrelated and does not provide a logical explanation for the need to maintain room temperature in the laboratory."}}
{"Q": "This farmer wants to build a fish pond. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He cuts off some grass. (B) The farmer found a suitable area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The farmer found a suitable area.\nExplanation: Building a fish pond requires a suitable area with proper water supply and drainage. Therefore, it is more plausible that the farmer found a suitable area rather than just cutting off some grass."}}
{"Q": "It is based on the principle of movement of air. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The experiment is to realize imitation of Thunder. (B) Propanol is a simple example of isomer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The experiment is to realize imitation of Thunder.\nExplanation: The principle of movement of air is related to the sound of thunder, which is caused by the rapid expansion of air due to the heat generated by lightning. Therefore, it is more plausible that the experiment is related to imitating the sound of thunder rather than the simple example of isomerism demonstrated by propanol."}}
{"Q": "A state of false pregnancy was established in her body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The progestin implanted in Lucy's body lost efficacy. (B) The progestin implanted in Lucy's body worked.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The progestin implanted in Lucy's body lost efficacy.\n\nExplanation: False pregnancy, also known as pseudocyesis, occurs when a woman experiences symptoms of pregnancy, such as missed periods, nausea, and weight gain, despite not being pregnant. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including psychological factors, hormonal imbalances, and medication side effects. In Lucy's case, the most likely cause of her false pregnancy is that the progestin implanted in her body lost efficacy. Progestin is a hormone that is often used in birth control methods, and it works by preventing ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. If the progestin loses efficacy, it may not be able to prevent ovulation, which could lead to a missed period and other symptoms of pregnancy."}}
{"Q": "We honored a kind of peaceful reconciliation of human difference. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) War ceased to bring us gunshots. (B) We hold the belief of pacifism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. We hold the belief of pacifism.\nExplanation: Honoring peaceful reconciliation of human difference means that we have chosen to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence. This promotes the belief of pacifism, which is the opposition to war and violence as a means of resolving disputes. It does not necessarily mean that war has completely ceased, but rather that we have chosen a different approach to conflict resolution."}}
{"Q": "His body has a poor untake of amino acids. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor recommended that he take a supplement of arginine to help depolarization of gut cells to improve. (B) The nutritionist advised him to eat more legumes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The nutritionist advised him to eat more legumes.\nExplanation: Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are essential for the growth and repair of tissues in the body. If the body has a poor uptake of amino acids, it may lead to a deficiency of protein, which can cause a range of health problems. Legumes are a good source of plant-based protein and can help to increase the intake of amino acids in the diet. Therefore, it is more plausible that a nutritionist would recommend eating more legumes rather than a specific amino acid supplement like arginine, which may not address the underlying cause of the poor uptake of amino acids."}}
{"Q": "I cooked Fucus vesiculosus for my father. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His thyroid function was promoted for more intake of iodine. (B) He wasn't poisoned.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Fucus vesiculosus, also known as bladderwrack, is a type of seaweed that is commonly used in traditional medicine for its high iodine content. However, consuming large amounts of bladderwrack can lead to iodine toxicity, which can cause adverse effects on thyroid function. Therefore, it is important to consume bladderwrack in moderation and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. As long as the father did not experience any adverse effects, it can be assumed that he was not poisoned by the Fucus vesiculosus."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's dog has suffered the brucellosis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It cannot be a mother any more. (B) He is no longer constipated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It cannot be a mother any more.\nExplanation: Brucellosis is a bacterial infection that can cause infertility and reproductive problems in animals, including dogs. Therefore, if Lucy's dog has suffered from brucellosis, it is likely that it cannot be a mother anymore due to the risk of passing on the infection to its offspring."}}
{"Q": "Tom's banjo doesn't work any more. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He changed the string and it works again. (B) Tom's bone is in a state of hyperextension.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If Tom changed the string, it is likely that the banjo would work again. On the other hand, Tom's bone being in a state of hyperextension has nothing to do with the banjo not working. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The user of the soap tried to obtain such a  fragrant resin from trees. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The soap I made contained Myrrh. (B) It was sunny yesterday.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The soap I made contained Myrrh.\nExplanation: Myrrh is a fragrant resin that is commonly used in soap making. Therefore, it is more plausible that the user was trying to obtain Myrrh to use in their soap rather than the weather being a factor."}}
{"Q": "The doctor prescribed some more delavirdine for him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The medicine prescribed by the doctor before Tom did not work. (B) The doctor advised Jack to eat more food containing amino acids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The medicine prescribed by the doctor before Tom did not work.\nExplanation: The fact that the doctor prescribed more delavirdine suggests that the previous prescription did not work as intended. Delavirdine is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection, and if the initial prescription was effective, there would be no need for additional medication. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not relevant to the prescription of delavirdine."}}
{"Q": "The filter-feeding shellfish ate some algae containing toxins. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Yield disadvantage was shown. (B) Toxins remain concentrated in the shellfish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Filter-feeding shellfish, such as mussels and oysters, are known to accumulate toxins from their environment, including harmful algae blooms. These toxins can remain concentrated in the shellfish, making them unsafe for human consumption. This is why there are strict regulations and monitoring programs in place to ensure that shellfish are safe to eat. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A, yield disadvantage, is not relevant to the scenario described."}}
{"Q": "The purpose is to prevent trichinosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This factory dares to innovate and uses robots for production. (B) The doctor said that we should not undercooked and raw pork.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The doctor said that we should not undercooked and raw pork.\nExplanation: Trichinosis is a disease caused by a parasite called Trichinella spiralis, which can be found in undercooked or raw pork. Therefore, the best way to prevent trichinosis is to cook pork thoroughly and avoid consuming it raw or undercooked. The use of robots in a factory has no direct relation to the prevention of trichinosis."}}
{"Q": "Officers need to go through professional training before taking up the post. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A sage took the lead in surrendering. (B) When we come across an emergency, we should call for professional help from officers in time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. When we come across an emergency, we should call for professional help from officers in time.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that officers are now better equipped to handle their duties after undergoing professional training. Therefore, it is more plausible that people should seek their help in emergencies, rather than relying on untrained individuals. Option A does not seem to be related to the statement and is not a logical consequence of officers receiving professional training."}}
{"Q": "The viper is the most poisonous one. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This species had significant mutations in last century. (B) There are a lot of various animals in the forest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A)\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the viper is the most poisonous one, which implies that it has evolved to become more venomous than other species. Option (A) suggests that significant mutations have occurred in the last century, which could have led to the development of more potent venom. This is a more plausible explanation than option (B), which is unrelated to the question and does not provide any explanation for the viper's venomousness."}}
{"Q": "Tom is practicing quadrille for dancing with his girlfriend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is going to join a party. (B) Soon there will be an important international dance competition.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom is practicing quadrille with his girlfriend suggests that he is preparing for a social event, such as a party or a wedding, where he will need to dance. Option B, which suggests an international dance competition, seems less likely given the context of the situation."}}
{"Q": "He often eats psyllium. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has been suffering from diarrhea recently. (B) He is still healthy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Psyllium is a type of soluble fiber that is commonly used as a laxative to treat constipation. However, if taken in excess, it can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues. Therefore, it is more likely that the person in question has been suffering from diarrhea recently as a result of consuming psyllium regularly."}}
{"Q": "Their descendants must be good at adapting to conditions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The biology teacher said that many creatures have a strong ability to adapt to the environment. (B) This enthic group has survived for thoudsands of years.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The fact that this ethnic group has survived for thousands of years suggests that their ancestors were able to adapt to changing conditions and pass on those traits to their descendants. This is a more plausible explanation than the statement made by the biology teacher, which is a general statement about many creatures and does not specifically address this ethnic group."}}
{"Q": "Tom swallowed the bulb. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was poisoned by the active components. (B) Doctor gave him diuretics as cure.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was poisoned by the active components.\nExplanation: Bulbs contain toxic substances such as alkaloids, glycosides, and saponins. When swallowed, these substances can cause poisoning, which can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In severe cases, it can even lead to death. Therefore, it is important to seek medical attention immediately if someone swallows a bulb. Diuretics are not a suitable cure for bulb poisoning."}}
{"Q": "A child sees a piece of cake on the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She tried to sink to yell for it. (B) Saliva flows out of his mouth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Saliva flows out of his mouth.\nExplanation: When a child sees a piece of cake on the table, it is likely that their mouth will start to water in anticipation of eating it. This is a natural physiological response known as the cephalic phase of digestion, which is triggered by the sight, smell, or even the thought of food. Therefore, it is more plausible that saliva would flow out of the child's mouth rather than them trying to sink or yell for the cake."}}
{"Q": "The boy curiously followed the flow of the creek. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Suddenly it began to rain. (B) He found a river finally.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He found a river finally.\nExplanation: Since the boy was following the flow of the creek, it is likely that he would eventually reach a larger body of water, such as a river. Option A, sudden rain, is not necessarily related to the boy's actions of following the creek and seems like an unrelated event. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Materials stored in the factory are of high flammability. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Natural enemies of mite pests are saved. (B) Anything causing fire is not allowed here.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Anything causing fire is not allowed here.\nExplanation: Since the materials stored in the factory are highly flammable, it is important to take precautions to prevent any fire accidents. Therefore, it is likely that the factory has strict rules and regulations in place to prohibit anything that could potentially cause a fire, such as smoking, open flames, or electrical equipment that is not properly maintained. This is a necessary safety measure to protect the workers and the factory from any potential harm. The presence of natural enemies of mite pests is not related to the flammability of the materials stored in the factory."}}
{"Q": "Little Emma is four years old. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She can't eat Hamburgs. (B) The doctor confirms that she does not suffer from autism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (None of the above)\nExplanation: The question does not provide enough information to determine what happened as a result of Little Emma being four years old. It is possible that nothing significant happened, or that she reached certain developmental milestones, or that she started school, among other possibilities. Therefore, it is important to avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information."}}
{"Q": "She ended her days in poverty. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She had dependency on drugs. (B) The poor lady became our queen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She had dependency on drugs.\nExplanation: Drug addiction can lead to financial instability and poverty as the individual may prioritize buying drugs over basic necessities such as food and shelter. Additionally, drug addiction can also lead to job loss and difficulty in finding employment, further contributing to financial struggles. On the other hand, becoming a queen would typically lead to a life of luxury and wealth, making option B less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Gorge hates the smell of all onions in the onion family. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He dislikes the silicons known as green onions as well. (B) He dislikes the Scallions known as green onions as well.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He dislikes the Scallions known as green onions as well.\n\nExplanation: Scallions are a type of green onion and belong to the onion family. Therefore, it is more plausible that Gorge would dislike scallions as well since they have a similar smell to other onions. Silicon is not related to onions, so it would not make sense for Gorge to dislike it based on his dislike of onions."}}
{"Q": "People always like to look at the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Suddenly it began to rain. (B) They always sit in the innermost seat of the plane.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Suddenly it began to rain.\n\nExplanation: Looking at the blue sky and white clouds outside the window is often associated with good weather. Therefore, it is more likely that sudden rain would be unexpected and disrupt the pleasant view. Sitting in the innermost seat of the plane is not directly related to the view outside the window."}}
{"Q": "He was diagnosed with hemias. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom feels his stomach aches. (B) The petechiae on his arm became pimples.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom feels his stomach aches.\nExplanation: Hemias is not a medical condition or diagnosis. It is possible that the intended word was \"hernia,\" which is a condition where an organ or tissue protrudes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle or connective tissue. This can cause pain and discomfort, which may be felt as stomach aches. Petechiae turning into pimples is not a symptom or cause of hernia."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought a lot of specialty from Beijing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They offered quality of product. (B) Jack drove a car to pick up Tom and the specialty.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They offered quality of product.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Tom bought a lot of specialty from Beijing, but it does not mention anything about Jack driving a car to pick up Tom and the specialty. Therefore, option B is not a plausible answer. However, the sentence implies that Tom was satisfied with the specialty he bought, which suggests that the products offered quality. Hence, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His immune system broke down. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John had HIV virus infection. (B) Ruhr's doctors found that Ruhr's white blood cells increased, and has leukocytosis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John had HIV virus infection.\nExplanation: HIV virus attacks and weakens the immune system by destroying the CD4 cells, which are responsible for fighting off infections and diseases. As a result, people with HIV are more susceptible to infections and illnesses that a healthy immune system would normally be able to fight off. Therefore, it is more plausible that John's immune system broke down due to HIV infection rather than leukocytosis, which is an increase in white blood cells and not necessarily indicative of a weakened immune system."}}
{"Q": "He found that they shed half of their exoskeleton each time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Biologists observed the molting of isopods. (B) The biologist has been observing rabbits for years.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Biologists observed the molting of isopods.\nExplanation: Isopods are known to shed their exoskeletons periodically as they grow. This process is called molting. Biologists have observed this behavior in isopods and have documented that they shed about half of their exoskeleton each time. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer as it is based on scientific knowledge and observation. Option B, on the other hand, is irrelevant to the context and does not provide any explanation for the shedding of exoskeletons."}}
{"Q": "His finger has been stained with the cigarette. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom hurt his fingernails badly in the car accident. (B) He has been smoking cigarettes for four years.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He has been smoking cigarettes for four years.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the stain on his finger is from smoking cigarettes, as the tar and nicotine in cigarettes can leave a yellowish-brown stain on fingers and teeth. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not explain how the cigarette caused the stain on his finger."}}
{"Q": "Vibrations of the vocal cords cause sore rubbing of the throat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lisa's voice changes a lot per second when she sings. (B) Speaking requires the vibration of the vocal cords, which are located in the throat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: When we speak or sing, our vocal cords vibrate to produce sound. These vibrations can cause friction and rubbing in the throat, leading to soreness. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the function of the vocal cords in causing the soreness. Option A may be a contributing factor to vocal strain, but it does not directly explain the soreness in the throat."}}
{"Q": "Faces of all audience watching the horror were projected on the screen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They saw their own pale faces. (B) They saw their own red  faces.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They saw their own pale faces.\nExplanation: When someone is scared or horrified, their face tends to turn pale due to the rush of adrenaline and blood flow away from the face. Therefore, it is more plausible that the audience saw their own pale faces on the screen rather than red faces, which is not a common physiological response to fear."}}
{"Q": "He perceived misery. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has a great sense of apperception. (B) Tom looked at the object representing the pioneers' hardships.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"Tom looked at the object representing the pioneers' hardships,\" which suggests that the cause of his perception of misery was the object he was looking at. Option A, which mentions a sense of apperception, is not directly related to the sentence and does not provide a clear explanation for the cause of Tom's perception of misery. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He lost his orientation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The little moose was alonein the forest. (B) The patient's global cerebral functions were affected.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The patient's global cerebral functions were affected.\nExplanation: Losing orientation is a symptom of cognitive impairment, which can be caused by various factors such as brain injury, dementia, or other neurological conditions. Option A, the little moose being alone in the forest, is not a plausible cause for a human losing orientation. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause of the patient's loss of orientation."}}
{"Q": "Lucy was doing a research about the material of the underwears. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She found that all of them contain polypropylene. (B) Limestone is the last choice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. She found that all of them contain polypropylene.\nExplanation: Polypropylene is a common material used in the manufacturing of underwears due to its moisture-wicking and breathable properties. Therefore, it is plausible that Lucy found that all of the underwears she researched contained polypropylene. On the other hand, limestone is not a common material used in underwears, making option B less plausible."}}
{"Q": "There are many mosquitoes around Jack's house. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He always carries fluoxetine with him. (B) He bought a lot of mosquito repellent.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He bought a lot of mosquito repellent.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack would buy mosquito repellent to protect himself from the mosquitoes rather than carrying fluoxetine, which is an antidepressant medication and has no effect on mosquito bites. Mosquito repellent is a common solution to prevent mosquito bites and is readily available in stores."}}
{"Q": "The mother feeds the baby milk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The baby kept crying when he was hungry. (B) The baby is full.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The baby kept crying when he was hungry.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for a mother to feed her baby milk is that the baby is hungry and needs to be fed. Crying is a common way for babies to communicate their hunger, and it is the mother's responsibility to provide nourishment for her child. Option B, that the baby is full, does not make sense in this context as the mother would not need to feed the baby if it was already full."}}
{"Q": "The crops grow well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A farmer uses a lot of fertilizer to grow his crops. (B) There is a beech in the garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The use of fertilizer is a common practice in agriculture to provide essential nutrients to the soil, which in turn promotes healthy plant growth. Therefore, it is more plausible that the crops grew well because the farmer used a lot of fertilizer rather than the presence of a beech tree in the garden, which may not have a direct impact on crop growth."}}
{"Q": "Emotional stress led to his lower body temperature. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He senstively felt the coldness of his extremities. (B) His parents suspected that he was ill.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He sensitively felt the coldness of his extremities.\nExplanation: Emotional stress can cause the body to release stress hormones, which can constrict blood vessels and reduce blood flow to the extremities. This can cause a person to feel cold or have cold hands and feet. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person in question would feel the coldness of their extremities rather than their parents suspecting they were ill."}}
{"Q": "He is very ill. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was infected with anthrax. (B) Tom has had a bad digestion recently.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom has had a bad digestion recently.\nExplanation: While anthrax is a serious illness, it is also relatively rare and unlikely to be the cause of someone's illness without additional context. On the other hand, digestive issues are a common cause of illness and can lead to a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's illness is due to a recent bout of bad digestion."}}
{"Q": "The experimenter selected both kinds of wood. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The experimenter is examining the rays in the wood. (B) The results of the experiments were demonstrated in the paragraph.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: The sentence preceding this one states that the experimenter is examining the rays in the wood. Therefore, it is plausible that the experimenter selected both kinds of wood to compare and contrast the rays in each type."}}
{"Q": "Jackson wanted to study the creatures of the human family. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He raised some money for the cost. (B) Jackson's professor recommended him to study hominids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jackson's professor recommended him to study hominids.\nExplanation: Since Jackson wanted to study the creatures of the human family, it is likely that his professor would recommend him to study hominids, which are the closest living relatives of humans. It is not mentioned in the given information that Jackson raised money for the cost, so option A is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "No one other than grandma can know the contents of the document. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Grandma and the bank signed a trust agreement. (B) Doctors are discussring the effective treatment measures of corneal neovascularization.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Grandma and the bank signed a trust agreement.\nExplanation: A trust agreement is a legal document that allows a third party, such as a bank, to hold assets on behalf of a beneficiary, such as a grandchild. The terms of the trust agreement can specify that only the beneficiary (in this case, grandma) has the right to know the contents of the document. This is a common practice in estate planning to ensure privacy and confidentiality. On the other hand, option B is unrelated to the given statement and does not provide a plausible explanation."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a healthy heart. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has a good blood circulation in his body. (B) He quickens his respiration rate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He has a good blood circulation in his body.\nExplanation: A healthy heart is responsible for pumping blood efficiently throughout the body, ensuring that all organs and tissues receive the necessary oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, having a healthy heart results in good blood circulation in the body. Quickening of respiration rate is not directly related to a healthy heart, but rather a response to physical activity or stress."}}
{"Q": "Tom's restaurant is not doing well. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He took to the streets to drum up customers. (B) His manager helped him work it out.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He took to the streets to drum up customers.\nExplanation: When a restaurant is not doing well, the owner or manager may need to take proactive measures to attract more customers. Taking to the streets to promote the restaurant and offer discounts or specials can be an effective way to increase foot traffic and revenue. While having a supportive manager can be helpful, it may not be enough to turn around a struggling business on its own."}}
{"Q": "Chinese will no longer be bullied. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Racism has been removed. (B) China is getting better and better.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) China is getting better and better.\nExplanation: China's rise as a global economic and military power has given it more leverage in international affairs, making it less susceptible to bullying from other countries. Additionally, China has been investing heavily in its military and technological capabilities, further strengthening its position on the world stage. While racism may still exist, it is not the primary factor in China's ability to resist bullying."}}
{"Q": "The whole classroom burst into laughter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The sound of coughing suddenly appear in the quiet classroom. (B) The sound of farting suddenly echoes in the quiet classroom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The sound of coughing suddenly appear in the quiet classroom.\nExplanation: While both options may be considered humorous, the sound of coughing is a more plausible cause for the whole classroom to burst into laughter. Farting may cause some laughter, but it is also likely to cause discomfort or embarrassment for the person who made the sound. Coughing, on the other hand, is a more common and less taboo bodily function, and the suddenness of the sound may have caught the students off guard and caused them to laugh."}}
{"Q": "In order to make resonance, Tom tries to shake a tub of water with different frequencies. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The water keeps vibrating without his shaking as he tries the same frequency as the water has. (B) The water stops vibrating immediately even though Tom's shaking frequency corresponds to its own.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The water keeps vibrating without his shaking as he tries the same frequency as the water has.\n\nExplanation: When Tom shakes the tub of water with a frequency that matches the natural frequency of the water, resonance occurs. This means that the energy from Tom's shaking is transferred to the water, causing it to vibrate with a larger amplitude. As the water vibrates, it creates waves that bounce back and forth between the sides of the tub, reinforcing each other and causing the water to continue vibrating even after Tom stops shaking. This phenomenon is known as resonance and is commonly observed in many different systems, including musical instruments, bridges, and buildings. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There are many molas in the sea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have green appearances. (B) Molas are easily bitten by other fish.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Molas are easily bitten by other fish.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that there are many molas in the sea, which could lead to increased competition for resources and potential predators. As a result, it is more plausible that molas are easily bitten by other fish rather than having green appearances, which is not necessarily related to their abundance in the sea."}}
{"Q": "The teacher suggested that they choose crinoids. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researcher put some spirogyras into the brine. (B) This research needs a sessile animal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The teacher suggested choosing crinoids because the research required a sessile animal, and crinoids are known to be sessile organisms. The fact that the researcher put spirogyras into the brine is not relevant to the choice of crinoids as the research subject."}}
{"Q": "A few days later, Tom observed the taproot of the grass. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom saw the grass germinate. (B) Tom has buried a lot of unknown seeds in his garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom saw the grass germinate.\nExplanation: The taproot is the first part of a plant to emerge during germination. Therefore, if Tom observed the taproot of the grass, it is likely that he witnessed the germination process. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not explain why Tom specifically observed the taproot of the grass."}}
{"Q": "Billy is reading about fat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His father tells him it is a mass of lymphatic tissue at the back of the throat. (B) Billy reads about lipids in his reading.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Billy reads about lipids in his reading.\nExplanation: Since the question is about Billy reading about fat, it is more plausible that he would come across information about lipids, which are the chemical compounds that make up fats. It is unlikely that his father would randomly tell him about the mass of lymphatic tissue at the back of the throat in the context of reading about fat."}}
{"Q": "I compared the faces of a cougar and a cat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There is something in commen between them. (B) I thought they have similar faces.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There is something in common between them.\nExplanation: Cougars and cats both belong to the family Felidae, which means they share certain physical characteristics. Therefore, it is likely that there are similarities between their faces."}}
{"Q": "Jane is a master of Selvage. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The finished lengthwise edges of her fabric works were always wonderful. (B) He removes the outer hard shells sometimes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The finished lengthwise edges of her fabric works were always wonderful.\nExplanation: Selvage refers to the self-finished edges of a woven fabric. Being a master of Selvage means that Jane is skilled at creating beautiful and well-finished edges on her fabric works. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the skill of Selvage and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Tom threw a piece of glass onto the quartz. . What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The glass broke into pieces. . (B) The quartz broke into pieces. .", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The glass broke into pieces.\nExplanation: When a piece of glass is thrown onto a hard surface like quartz, it is more likely that the glass will break into pieces rather than the quartz breaking. This is because glass is a brittle material and is more prone to breaking upon impact. Quartz, on the other hand, is a harder and more durable material that is less likely to break upon impact. Therefore, it is more plausible that the glass broke into pieces rather than the quartz."}}
{"Q": "The lactating woman took hydrazine. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her breasts become bigger and bigger. (B) The baby had related adverse reactions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The baby had related adverse reactions.\nExplanation: Hydrazine is a chemical compound that is toxic and can cause serious health problems. If a lactating woman takes hydrazine, it can be passed on to the baby through breast milk, causing adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It is unlikely that the woman's breasts would become bigger and bigger as a result of taking hydrazine."}}
{"Q": "Farmers like autumn. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Harvests make farmers tired. (B) Harvests make farmers happy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Harvests make farmers happy.\nExplanation: Autumn is the time when farmers reap the fruits of their labor. They harvest their crops and gather the fruits of their hard work throughout the year. This is a time of celebration and satisfaction for farmers as they see the results of their hard work. Therefore, it is more plausible that farmers like autumn because it brings them happiness and a sense of accomplishment rather than making them tired."}}
{"Q": "There are many tools in front of the tree. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mammoth is one of them. (B) Tom recognizes the stick at once.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer as they are not related to the information given in the sentence. \n\nExplanation: The sentence only states that there are many tools in front of the tree, but it does not provide any information about Mammoth or Tom recognizing a stick. Therefore, it is important to choose an answer that is relevant to the sentence and based on the information provided."}}
{"Q": "This thruse has hurt its wings. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The biggest one weighs several hundred pounds. (B) It has difficulty in flying.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It has difficulty in flying.\n\nExplanation: If a thrush hurts its wings, it is likely to have difficulty in flying as the wings are essential for flight. Option (A) about the weight of the thrush is not relevant to the situation and does not provide any explanation for the consequence of the injury. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is willing to offer help. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He often assists people. (B) The department accepts his proposal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He often assists people.\nExplanation: If Tom is willing to offer help, it implies that he is open to assisting others. Therefore, it is more plausible that he often assists people rather than a specific department accepting his proposal."}}
{"Q": "Hellbenders have strong limbs as sea creatures. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have energy to carry out their own life functions. (B) They always walk under the sea.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They have energy to carry out their own life functions.\nExplanation: Hellbenders are not sea creatures, but rather large, aquatic salamanders found in rivers and streams in North America. Their strong limbs are adapted for swimming and crawling along the river bottom, allowing them to hunt for prey and navigate their environment. This adaptation gives them the energy they need to carry out their own life functions, such as finding food and avoiding predators. Walking under the sea is not a behavior exhibited by hellbenders, as they are strictly freshwater animals."}}
{"Q": "The lawn has nitrogen inside. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has collected a lot of leaves. (B) Gardeners offer the lawn enough fertiles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Gardeners often use fertilizers that contain nitrogen to promote healthy growth in lawns. While leaves can also contribute nitrogen to the soil as they decompose, it is less likely to be the sole cause of a significant increase in nitrogen levels in a lawn. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom saw a lot of pretty birds in the national park. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom took a visit to the national park. (B) Tom is assertive.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom took a visit to the national park.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom saw a lot of pretty birds in the national park because he took a visit to the national park. This is a logical cause-and-effect relationship, as national parks are known for their diverse wildlife and bird populations. Option B, \"Tom is assertive,\" does not provide a logical explanation for why Tom saw pretty birds in the national park."}}
{"Q": "Tom has exploring the secret of the nature. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sulfur was found. (B) He found lectins everywhere.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's exploration of nature led him to discover sulfur, as it is a naturally occurring element that can be found in various forms in the environment. On the other hand, lectins are a type of protein that are found in certain plants and can have toxic effects on humans if consumed in large quantities, so it is less likely that Tom would find them \"everywhere\" in his exploration of nature."}}
{"Q": "The two soldiers are very anxious. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a great tension between them. (B) It's easier for the two of them to communicate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It's easier for the two of them to communicate.\nExplanation: When people are anxious, they tend to be more alert and focused on their surroundings. This heightened state of awareness can make it easier for the soldiers to communicate with each other, as they may be more attuned to each other's body language and nonverbal cues. On the other hand, if there is great tension between them, it may be more difficult for them to work together effectively. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Recording polarity is very important in John's experiment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John recorded the the phase of the signal in relation to the string vibration. (B) He recorded a continuum of energies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John recorded the phase of the signal in relation to the string vibration.\n\nExplanation: Polarity refers to the direction of the electrical signal in a recording. In John's experiment, recording polarity is important because it determines the phase relationship between the electrical signal and the string vibration. By recording the correct polarity, John was able to accurately measure the phase of the signal in relation to the string vibration, which is important for understanding the behavior of the system being studied. Recording a continuum of energies (option B) is not directly related to polarity and would not be affected by it."}}
{"Q": "They had appearances. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This cell had Necrosis. (B) They were all fleshes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This cell had Necrosis.\nExplanation: Necrosis is a type of cell death that can cause changes in the appearance of tissues. This could include changes in color, texture, or shape. Therefore, if a group of cells had appearances, it is more likely that they were experiencing necrosis rather than being fleshes (which is not a medical term)."}}
{"Q": "John's cheating was discovered by the teacher and his exam was terminated. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John attempted to cheat in the exam. (B) John hit the teacher before the exam.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John attempted to cheat in the exam.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that John's cheating was discovered by the teacher and his exam was terminated. There is no mention of John hitting the teacher before the exam. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It saves surplus prey. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fox was hunted by hunters. (B) Foxes have been hunting well recently.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: If foxes have been hunting well recently, it is likely that they have been able to catch more prey than they need to survive. This surplus prey can then be saved for later consumption, which could explain why the fox is saving it. On the other hand, if the fox was hunted by hunters, it is unlikely that it would have the opportunity to save surplus prey as it would be focused on avoiding danger and finding enough food to survive."}}
{"Q": "I appreciated the works of the artist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I understood the the objectification of his feeling. (B) I learned how to apply knowledge from him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: By appreciating the works of the artist, it is more likely that the individual learned how to apply knowledge from the artist rather than understanding the objectification of his feelings. Appreciating an artist's work can inspire and teach individuals about different techniques, styles, and perspectives that they can apply in their own work or life. It does not necessarily mean that the individual understands the artist's personal emotions or intentions behind their work."}}
{"Q": "The bad guy wants to infere the program. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He needs to be certified by the Finance Bureau. (B) He found some bullies to make destructions to the building.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He found some bullies to make destructions to the building.\nExplanation: If the bad guy wants to interfere with the program, it is more likely that he would resort to destructive means rather than getting certified by the Finance Bureau. Hiring bullies to cause destruction to the building would be a plausible way for him to achieve his goal."}}
{"Q": "The researcher made a nitrification. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The researcher wants to oxidize the ammonia into nitrate. (B) The researcher put these kinds of amino acid into the water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The researcher wants to oxidize the ammonia into nitrate.\nExplanation: Nitrification is the process of converting ammonia (NH3) into nitrite (NO2-) and then into nitrate (NO3-) by bacteria. This process is important in the nitrogen cycle and is often used in wastewater treatment to remove nitrogen compounds. Therefore, it is more plausible that the researcher made a nitrification to oxidize the ammonia into nitrate rather than adding amino acids to the water, which would not necessarily lead to nitrification."}}
{"Q": "Everyday there are some germs invading our body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The immunity system defend our body from being ill. (B) We benefit from producers for bad life quality.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The immunity system defend our body from being ill.\nExplanation: When germs invade our body, our immune system recognizes them as foreign invaders and produces antibodies to fight against them. This process helps to protect our body from getting sick and is a natural defense mechanism. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not relevant to the question and does not make sense in the context of germs invading our body."}}
{"Q": "They all have good jobs now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The students in this class have graduated long time ago. (B) People are all happy and rich.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The students in this class have graduated long time ago.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the individuals referred to in the sentence have good jobs now. The most plausible reason for this is that they have graduated from their respective schools and have been able to secure good jobs over time. Option B, which suggests that people are all happy and rich, is not a logical explanation for the cause of the individuals having good jobs."}}
{"Q": "He was caught for killing endangered species of Australian marsupials. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This group saw another group end. (B) The Man hunted Bilbies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The Man hunted Bilbies.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the man was caught for killing endangered species of Australian marsupials. Among the choices, only option B mentions hunting, which is the most plausible cause for the man's actions. Bilbies are a type of endangered marsupial found in Australia, and the man was likely hunting them illegally, leading to his arrest. Option A is not related to the given information and is therefore an irrelevant choice."}}
{"Q": "There is a sedge in Tom's garden. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found the sedge was bending. (B) Doctor thinks Tom has insomnia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He found the sedge was bending.\nExplanation: The question states that there is a sedge in Tom's garden, which implies that Tom noticed it. The only logical outcome related to the sedge would be that Tom observed it bending or growing in a certain way. Option B, which suggests that a doctor thinks Tom has insomnia, is completely unrelated to the presence of a sedge in his garden. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The situation in the Middle East is uncertain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Some experts intend to make some assessments. (B) People are making efforts to exploit oil reserves.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Some experts intend to make some assessments.\nExplanation: The uncertainty in the Middle East suggests that there may be political, economic, or social changes that could impact the region and the world. As a result, experts may want to assess the situation to better understand the potential risks and opportunities. On the other hand, the exploitation of oil reserves is a long-standing issue in the Middle East and is not necessarily related to the current uncertainty in the region. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mike lives in a basin. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His distress keeps hime awake during the night. (B) He is used to the seasonal variability.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: Living in a basin means that Mike is surrounded by mountains or hills, which can cause seasonal variability in weather patterns. This could include changes in temperature, precipitation, and wind. Over time, Mike would likely become accustomed to these changes and adjust his lifestyle accordingly. While living in a basin could potentially cause distress for some people due to factors such as air pollution or limited access to resources, there is no information in the question to suggest that this is the case for Mike. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes to open a new book on the first day of a month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom can finish reading at least one book a month. (B) He thinks it will help him lose weight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom can finish reading at least one book a month.\nExplanation: Since Tom likes to open a new book on the first day of a month, it implies that he is an avid reader and sets a goal to finish at least one book per month. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B is not related to the given information and seems irrelevant."}}
{"Q": "Horticulturists plant heaths and eventually make a sea of flowers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It's time for thrushes to propagate. (B) There is a lot of acidic soil in this place.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There is a lot of acidic soil in this place.\nExplanation: Heath plants thrive in acidic soil, which is why horticulturists plant them in such soil. As the heaths grow and bloom, they create a sea of flowers, adding beauty to the landscape. The presence of acidic soil is the most plausible reason for the success of heath planting in this scenario. The option (A) is not relevant to the growth of heaths."}}
{"Q": "Programmers detect through flows. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The programmer is detecting the data of object movement. (B) Water in terrestrial system has runoff.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Programmers detect through flows because they are constantly monitoring the flow of data within a program or system. This includes detecting the movement of objects and the transfer of information between different components. The term \"flow\" in this context refers to the movement and manipulation of data within a program, rather than the movement of water in a terrestrial system (which is unrelated to programming)."}}
{"Q": "The oosperm of a frog is in the egg. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A frog cannot love without water. (B) A tadpole would first feel the world in the pond.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: When the oosperm of a frog is in the egg, it undergoes development and eventually hatches into a tadpole. Tadpoles are aquatic and live in ponds or other bodies of water, where they can swim and feed on algae and other small organisms. Therefore, it is more plausible that a tadpole would first feel the world in the pond, rather than a frog not being able to love without water."}}
{"Q": "They mixed cement with water by pouring it into the pit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After stirring for a while, the contents of the pit synthesize new substances and harden. (B) After mixing for a while, water is still water and cement is still cement.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: When cement is mixed with water, a chemical reaction occurs which causes the mixture to harden and form a solid mass. This process is called hydration and it results in the formation of new substances, such as calcium silicate hydrate and calcium hydroxide. Therefore, after stirring for a while, the contents of the pit would synthesize new substances and harden, making it a more plausible answer than option B."}}
{"Q": "Tom has symptoms of keratinization. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor advised Tom to add more nutrition. (B) The doctor suspects that Tom has squamous cell carcinoma.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The doctor suspects that Tom has squamous cell carcinoma.\nExplanation: Keratinization is the process of hardening and thickening of the skin due to the accumulation of keratin, a protein that forms the outer layer of the skin. This condition can be a symptom of squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer that develops in the squamous cells of the skin. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor would suspect cancer rather than simply advising Tom to add more nutrition. However, further tests and examinations would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."}}
{"Q": "Tom used his prizes as evidence. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's pupils became bigger and he could see clearly. (B) His potential to win another game was demonstrated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His potential to win another game was demonstrated.\nExplanation: Using his prizes as evidence likely showed others that Tom had previously won games and had the skills to potentially win again. This could increase his credibility and make others more likely to want to play against him or choose him as a teammate. It is unlikely that using his prizes as evidence would have any physical effect on Tom's eyesight."}}
{"Q": "Harbin Institute of technology is the best school to keep warm in winter in China. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Harbin Institute of technology uniformly installed the building with heat insulation panels. (B) Harbin Institute of technology bought a lot of air conditioners.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Harbin, located in northeastern China, is known for its extremely cold winters. To combat this, Harbin Institute of Technology has uniformly installed the building with heat insulation panels, which helps to keep the warmth inside the buildings and reduce heat loss. This is a more plausible answer than option B, as air conditioners are not typically used for heating in cold climates and would not be an effective solution for keeping warm in the winter."}}
{"Q": "They will be installed with new facilities. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are many newsstands in this city. (B) Many public utilities in this city were very old.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Many public utilities in this city were very old.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that new facilities will be installed, which implies that the current facilities are outdated or inadequate. Option B provides a plausible reason for this, as it suggests that many public utilities in the city are old and need to be replaced or upgraded. Option A, on the other hand, is irrelevant to the sentence and does not provide a logical explanation for the installation of new facilities."}}
{"Q": "Pouches can let air in. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Air enters cavities. (B) Each pouch has a cavity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Each pouch has a cavity.\nExplanation: Pouches are designed to hold and store items, and they typically have a cavity or space inside. If the pouch is not properly sealed or if the material is not airtight, air can enter the cavity and potentially affect the contents inside. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the design and function of pouches. Option (A) is not as relevant as it refers to air entering cavities in general, without specifically addressing the issue of pouches."}}
{"Q": "He was infected with virus. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The patient has been injected with the medicine containing immunization. (B) Insects had contact with his nake wound.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Insects had contact with his nake wound.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the patient was infected with a virus through contact with insects that carried the virus and had contact with his open wound. Injection with immunization medicine would not cause a virus infection."}}
{"Q": "Inside the house is cooler than outside. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather is hot in summer. (B) The temperature in summer and winter is more extreme.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The temperature in summer and winter is more extreme.\n\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the temperature inside the house is cooler than outside, which implies that the outside temperature is higher. Option (A) suggests that the weather is hot in summer, but it does not explain why the inside of the house is cooler. Option (B) is a more plausible answer because extreme temperatures in summer and winter can cause the house to be better insulated, which can keep the inside cooler in summer and warmer in winter. Therefore, option (B) is a more likely cause of the cooler temperature inside the house."}}
{"Q": "I could barely see trees around. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was doing experiment on a tundra. (B) The yard was overgrown with weeds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: If the speaker could barely see trees around, it is more likely that they were in a tundra where trees are scarce, rather than in a yard overgrown with weeds where trees would still be visible."}}
{"Q": "The Superconductive material can keep the temperature of the circuit. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The conditions in this place are very good. (B) Conducting electricity without resistance won't emit a lot heat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\n\nExplanation: Superconductive materials have the ability to conduct electricity without any resistance, which means that there is no energy loss in the form of heat. This is because the electrons in the material move in a coordinated manner, without colliding with each other or with the atoms in the material. As a result, the temperature of the circuit can be maintained at a very low level, even when a large amount of current is flowing through it. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it explains the scientific reason behind the phenomenon. Option A is not a valid explanation as it does not provide any scientific reasoning for the observed behavior."}}
{"Q": "His encouraging plan had more effectiveness. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boss wants to develop business. (B) The leader's effort had positive effect on the staff.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The leader's effort had positive effect on the staff.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the plan was encouraging, which implies that it had a positive impact on the staff. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the plan's effectiveness was the leader's effort to motivate and inspire the staff, rather than the boss's desire to develop business."}}
{"Q": "The plane should not fly in troposphere at last. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The plane should fly by only a few feet above the ground. (B) The plane needs to fly smoothly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The plane needs to fly smoothly.\n\nExplanation: The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, extending from the surface up to about 7-20 km. It is where most of the Earth's weather occurs, including turbulence, thunderstorms, and strong winds. Therefore, flying in the troposphere can be challenging and dangerous for planes, especially if they need to fly smoothly. Flying at a low altitude (choice A) would not necessarily prevent turbulence or other weather-related issues. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of not flying in the troposphere is to ensure a smooth flight."}}
{"Q": "He brought his cat to the vet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was infected at the first time. (B) The vet asserted it has panleukopenia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The vet asserted it has panleukopenia.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because bringing a cat to the vet usually results in a diagnosis or treatment plan. Panleukopenia is a serious viral disease that affects cats, so it would be important for the vet to identify it and provide appropriate care. Being infected at the first time is not a likely outcome of bringing a cat to the vet, as long as proper precautions are taken to prevent the spread of disease."}}
{"Q": "The enemy dropped a lethal biological weapon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People inside faced great inconvenience. (B) Many people were infected with anthrax.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Many people were infected with anthrax.\nExplanation: A lethal biological weapon is designed to cause harm and death to a large number of people. Anthrax is a common biological weapon that can cause severe illness and death. Therefore, it is more plausible that many people were infected with anthrax rather than just facing inconvenience. The use of such weapons is a serious threat to public health and safety."}}
{"Q": "Peter was particularly good at cryptanalysis at the military academy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) To some extent, this shows that students have a strong connection with him. (B) During the exercise, he successfully cracked the other party's cryptosystem.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Peter was good at cryptanalysis at the military academy. This implies that during exercises or missions, he was able to successfully crack the other party's cryptosystem, which would be a valuable skill in military intelligence. The sentence does not mention anything about students having a strong connection with him, so option A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His trials always fail. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He likes to do trials. (B) He doesn't have a method at all.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He doesn't have a method at all.\nExplanation: Without a method or plan, it is difficult to conduct successful trials. Even if someone enjoys doing trials, without a proper approach, they are likely to fail. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Yeasts are prokaryotes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Yeast has no chromosomes. (B) They began to find food at night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Yeast has no chromosomes.\n\nExplanation: This statement is incorrect. Yeasts are not prokaryotes, they are eukaryotes. As eukaryotes, yeasts have a nucleus and chromosomes. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer as it reflects the incorrect assumption made in the question. Option B is not related to the statement and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Scientists keep hydrogen peroxide at room temperature. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists need to break down hydrogen peroxide. (B) Scientists need to keep hydrogen peroxide stable.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Scientists need to keep hydrogen peroxide stable.\n\nExplanation: Hydrogen peroxide is a relatively unstable compound that can decompose into water and oxygen gas over time. However, this decomposition process can be accelerated by heat, light, or the presence of certain catalysts. Therefore, scientists typically store hydrogen peroxide at room temperature to minimize its decomposition rate and maintain its stability. This allows them to use it as a reliable oxidizing agent in various chemical reactions and industrial processes. Breaking down hydrogen peroxide is not a common goal for scientists, as they usually want to use it as a source of oxygen or as a disinfectant."}}
{"Q": "They walked along the stream. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They found lots of fish in it. (B) They went to ponds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: None of the choices are plausible based on the given information. \nExplanation: The sentence only states that they walked along the stream, and does not provide any indication of what happened as a result. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what happened next based on the given information."}}
{"Q": "There is grass on alpine steppes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Yaks were fed on alpine steppes. (B) It is big enough to fill one's hand.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Yaks were fed on alpine steppes.\nExplanation: Alpine steppes are high-altitude grasslands that are found in mountainous regions. These grasslands provide a natural habitat for yaks, which are well adapted to living in harsh, cold environments. Yaks are herbivores and feed on the grasses that grow on alpine steppes. Therefore, it is more plausible that the presence of grass on alpine steppes would result in yaks being fed on these grasslands. Option B, \"It is big enough to fill one's hand,\" does not make sense in the context of the given information about alpine steppes and grass."}}
{"Q": "People believe its good quality. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This brand is dominant. (B) Tom is good at providing advice.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The fact that people believe the product is of good quality suggests that the brand has established a reputation for producing high-quality products. This reputation could be the result of various factors, such as consistent product performance, positive reviews, and word-of-mouth recommendations. Tom's ability to provide advice may influence individual purchasing decisions, but it is unlikely to be the primary cause of the brand's overall reputation for quality."}}
{"Q": "The drying time of all paints changed except for latexes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Humidity was decreased. (B) The temperature in summer and winter is more extreme.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The humidity was decreased.\n\nExplanation: The drying time of paints is affected by the amount of moisture in the air. When the humidity is high, it takes longer for the paint to dry because the moisture in the air slows down the evaporation of the solvents in the paint. Conversely, when the humidity is low, the paint dries faster because there is less moisture in the air to interfere with the drying process. Therefore, if the drying time of all paints changed except for latexes, it is likely that the humidity was decreased, which would have caused the other types of paints to dry faster. The temperature alone would not have such a significant impact on the drying time of paints."}}
{"Q": "Patients with cancer always have sudden pain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She becomes despaired. (B) The doctor will give them some meperidine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The doctor will give them some meperidine.\nExplanation: While it is true that cancer patients may experience sudden pain, it is not necessarily true that they will become despaired. However, it is common for doctors to prescribe pain medication such as meperidine to manage the pain and improve the patient's quality of life. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Nine of them usually have delusions and the other sometimes does. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ten people in the hospital have schizophrenia. (B) The police need keen-eyed hunting dogs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Ten people in the hospital have schizophrenia.\nExplanation: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking. It is a common condition that affects about 1% of the population. Therefore, it is plausible that ten people in the hospital have schizophrenia, and nine of them usually have delusions while the other sometimes does. On the other hand, option B about the police needing hunting dogs is not related to the given information and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to be refrained from sex. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He write this message down. (B) He became a monk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He wrote this message down.\nExplanation: Becoming a monk is a drastic and life-changing decision that requires a lot of commitment and dedication. It is unlikely that someone would make such a decision without a strong religious or spiritual motivation. On the other hand, writing a message down is a simple and practical way to remind oneself of a personal goal or commitment. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom wrote this message down as a reminder to himself to refrain from sex."}}
{"Q": "I hide the way of my life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I don't want others know I followed Paganism. (B) My father managed the change of this old bridge for ten years.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the person is hiding the way of their life suggests that it is something that may not be accepted or understood by others. Paganism is often misunderstood and stigmatized, so it is plausible that the person may not want others to know about their beliefs. On the other hand, the second choice about the father managing a bridge change does not seem to have a direct connection to the person hiding their way of life."}}
{"Q": "Fertilization was ready to start. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The gametophyte was formed. (B) The egg was formed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The gametophyte was formed.\nExplanation: Fertilization is the fusion of male and female gametes to form a zygote. For fertilization to occur, both male and female gametophytes must be formed. The male gametophyte produces sperm cells, while the female gametophyte produces egg cells. Therefore, the formation of the gametophyte is a prerequisite for fertilization to occur. The formation of the egg alone (option B) is not sufficient for fertilization to start."}}
{"Q": "He soon suffered from obesity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He lays on the sofa and watches TV every day. (B) He eats salad every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He lays on the sofa and watches TV every day.\nExplanation: Obesity is often caused by a lack of physical activity and a high intake of calories. Choice A suggests that the person is leading a sedentary lifestyle, which can contribute to weight gain. Choice B, on the other hand, suggests that the person is eating healthily, which would not typically lead to obesity. Therefore, choice A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Atoms in oxygen molecules have a greater ability to attract electrons to themselves than nitrogen molecules. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They begin to ingnore causes in any aspect for solutions. (B) Oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen.\n\nExplanation: Electronegativity is the measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons towards itself in a chemical bond. Oxygen has a higher electronegativity value than nitrogen, which means that oxygen atoms have a greater ability to attract electrons towards themselves than nitrogen atoms. As a result, the oxygen molecule has a stronger bond between its atoms than the nitrogen molecule, making it more stable and less likely to react with other molecules. This property of oxygen and nitrogen is important in understanding their chemical behavior and their role in various chemical reactions."}}
{"Q": "Dogs only have four legs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dogs belong to canids. (B) Now it is mating season.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Dogs only have four legs because they belong to the canid family, which is characterized by having four legs. This is a biological trait that has been passed down through generations of canids, including dogs. Mating season has no relevance to the number of legs a dog has."}}
{"Q": "His gum is inflamed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) All the living cells in his body were not functioning properly. (B) He had the same symptoms.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He had the same symptoms.\nExplanation: Inflammation of the gum is a localized response to injury or infection. It does not affect all the living cells in the body, so option (A) is not a plausible answer. The most likely result of gum inflammation is that the affected individual will experience symptoms such as pain, swelling, and redness in the affected area. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The mitochondrion of the leave has been hurt. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are mildew spots on some leaves. (B) The leave is withered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The leave is withered.\nExplanation: Mitochondria are responsible for producing energy in plant cells through cellular respiration. If the mitochondrion of a leaf is hurt, it will affect the plant's ability to produce energy, leading to a lack of nutrients and water uptake. This will cause the leaf to wither and eventually die. Mildew spots are more likely to be caused by fungal infections or environmental factors such as high humidity, and are not directly related to mitochondrial damage."}}
{"Q": "The manager was greatly irritated by the low salary. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The manager gave him a salary as an award. (B) He had strong response toward the salary.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He had strong response toward the salary.\nExplanation: When someone is greatly irritated by something, it means they are experiencing a strong negative emotion towards it. In this case, the manager's strong negative emotion was towards the low salary. Therefore, it is more plausible that the manager had a strong response towards the salary rather than giving himself a salary as an award."}}
{"Q": "All people in the village died. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Famine happened in the village. (B) The general killed all villagers there.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Famine happened in the village.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a famine occurred in the village, leading to the death of all its inhabitants. Famine is a common cause of death in areas where there is a lack of food and resources. On the other hand, it is unlikely that a general would kill all the villagers without any reason or motive."}}
{"Q": "Tom made a lot of short-term investments with the government. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is employed by the government. (B) He made a lot of profits.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He made a lot of profits.\nExplanation: Short-term investments with the government typically involve buying and selling securities such as Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. These investments are generally considered low-risk and can provide a decent return on investment. Therefore, it is likely that Tom made a lot of profits from his short-term investments with the government. It is not mentioned in the question that he is employed by the government, so option A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The art exhibition was a great success. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put the surfactant in the solution. (B) A number of artists are invited to the art exhibition.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A number of artists are invited to the art exhibition.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible as the success of an art exhibition is usually determined by the quality and variety of artworks on display. Inviting a number of artists ensures a diverse range of styles and mediums, which can attract a larger audience and generate more interest in the exhibition. Adding surfactant to a solution may be relevant in a scientific experiment, but it is not relevant to the success of an art exhibition."}}
{"Q": "Toby is very interested in the cliffs of Huashan Mountain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He goes climbing this summer vacation. (B) He found very high topographic relief.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Since Toby is very interested in the cliffs of Huashan Mountain, it is more plausible that he would want to experience them firsthand by going climbing this summer vacation. It is less likely that he would simply find out about the high topographic relief without any intention of exploring it further."}}
{"Q": "Alice got married last year. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She got pregnant last week. (B) They have a little baby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They have a little baby.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alice and her spouse had time to settle into married life before deciding to have a baby. Getting pregnant just one year after getting married is possible, but not as common as waiting a bit longer. Therefore, it is more likely that they have a little baby now, rather than Alice getting pregnant just last week."}}
{"Q": "His penis bleeds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His penis was pierced by a small wooden stick. (B) He didn't feel the electric current.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His penis was pierced by a small wooden stick.\nExplanation: Bleeding from the penis can be caused by various factors such as trauma, infection, or underlying medical conditions. However, in this scenario, the most plausible cause is that the penis was pierced by a small wooden stick, which can cause significant bleeding and damage to the penile tissue. On the other hand, option B, which suggests that he didn't feel the electric current, is not a likely cause of penile bleeding."}}
{"Q": "Climates are different in the two places. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are so many bettles there. (B) The environments in the two places are also different.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Climates play a significant role in shaping the environment of a place. Different climates lead to different types of vegetation, wildlife, and natural resources. Therefore, it is more plausible that the environments in the two places are also different due to their distinct climates. The presence of beetles in one place may be due to various factors, such as food availability, habitat suitability, or human activities, but it cannot be directly attributed to the difference in climates between the two places."}}
{"Q": "Balsa is suitable for making a float. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a rotten fruit on the ground. (B) Floats are made of lightweight wood.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Floats are made of lightweight wood.\nExplanation: Balsa wood is known for its lightweight and buoyant properties, making it an ideal material for making floats. It is also easy to carve and shape, which makes it a popular choice for crafting various types of floats. On the other hand, the presence of a rotten fruit on the ground has no relation to the suitability of balsa wood for making floats."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to the park. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom felt more relaxed than before. (B) Tom got stinged by mosquitoes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom felt more relaxed than before.\nExplanation: Going to the park is often associated with relaxation and being in nature. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom felt more relaxed than before rather than getting stung by mosquitoes, which is not necessarily a common occurrence in every park visit."}}
{"Q": "Mary is a three-year-old baby. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many of her peers are suffering from tonsillitis. (B) This kept her from gaining weight easily.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. This kept her from gaining weight easily.\nExplanation: As a three-year-old baby, Mary's immune system is still developing, making her more susceptible to illnesses. However, the statement does not provide any information that suggests that Mary's peers are suffering from tonsillitis. On the other hand, it is common for young children to struggle with gaining weight due to various factors such as picky eating habits, digestive issues, and illnesses. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The virus became inactive. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He added a lot of Bacillus to the soil. (B) Tom utilized lyophilization to dispose some lethal virus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Lyophilization, also known as freeze-drying, is a process that removes water from a substance by freezing it and then subjecting it to a vacuum. This process can be used to preserve biological materials, including viruses, by removing the water that is necessary for their survival. By utilizing lyophilization to dispose of the lethal virus, Tom likely removed the water from the virus, causing it to become inactive and no longer able to infect or harm living organisms. Adding Bacillus to the soil would not necessarily have any effect on the virus."}}
{"Q": "There is profound negative effects. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Smoking will inhale nicotine. (B) The population of the area is decreasing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Smoking is known to have profound negative effects on health, including increased risk of cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. Nicotine, the addictive substance in cigarettes, is a major contributor to these negative effects. Therefore, it is more plausible that smoking and inhaling nicotine is the cause of the profound negative effects rather than the population of the area decreasing."}}
{"Q": "It began to grow tusks. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mother elephant in the zoo gave birth. (B) The female elephant in the zoo is getting old.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The female elephant in the zoo is getting old.\nExplanation: As elephants age, they may develop tusks. This is a natural process and is more likely to occur in female elephants. The birth of a baby elephant would not cause an adult elephant to suddenly grow tusks. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The frail Maria coughs for a long time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He suffered from long scars. (B) Her lungs are obviously inflamed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Her lungs are obviously inflamed.\nExplanation: The fact that Maria is coughing for a long time suggests that there is an issue with her respiratory system. Inflammation of the lungs is a common cause of persistent coughing, and it is likely that this is what is happening to Maria. Option A, which suggests that she suffered from long scars, is not a plausible answer as there is no information in the question to suggest that this is the case."}}
{"Q": "He dug up a snapdragon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found it had shallow root. (B) He discovered that it could blossom and bear fruit on its own.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He found it had shallow root.\nExplanation: Snapdragons are known to have shallow roots, so it is more plausible that the person digging it up would discover this fact rather than the plant suddenly being able to blossom and bear fruit on its own. Additionally, snapdragons are not typically known for bearing fruit, further supporting the likelihood of choice A being the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "The researchers conducted cloning experiments. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researcher observed that the drones mated with the queen. (B) Some people were responsible for producing genetic copies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Some people were responsible for producing genetic copies.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"cloning experiments,\" which suggests that the researchers were attempting to produce genetic copies of an organism. Option A, which suggests that the drones mated with the queen, is not related to cloning experiments. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What he follows is not real libertarianism. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom follows ducks. (B) My father only wants individual liberty but not individual responsibility.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the cause of Tom not following real libertarianism is related to the concept of individual responsibility. This implies that Tom may only be interested in the individual liberty aspect of libertarianism, but not willing to take responsibility for the consequences of his actions. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer. Option (A) is irrelevant and does not provide any explanation for Tom's deviation from real libertarianism."}}
{"Q": "A cell line is differentiated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is different from other cell lines now. (B) The nuclear of the cell hasn't been divided.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It is different from other cell lines now.\nExplanation: Differentiation refers to the process by which a cell becomes specialized to perform a specific function. As a result of differentiation, the cell line will have different characteristics and functions compared to other cell lines. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Option B is incorrect because the division of the nucleus is not related to differentiation."}}
{"Q": "The tumble caused his dehiscence. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a change in his vision. (B) The previously joined wound separated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The previously joined wound separated.\nExplanation: Dehiscence refers to the separation of previously joined tissues or wound edges. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the tumble caused the wound to separate, resulting in dehiscence. There is no indication in the sentence that the tumble had any effect on the person's vision."}}
{"Q": "He bought a big mat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He applied a design for specific use. (B) He used it to cover the floor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He used it to cover the floor.\nExplanation: Since the sentence only mentions that he bought a big mat, the most plausible outcome would be that he used it for its intended purpose, which is to cover the floor. Option A, which suggests that he applied a design for specific use, is less likely as there is no indication in the sentence that he did anything other than purchase the mat."}}
{"Q": "Jerry was in need of a design for his company's logo. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jerry turned to an enterprises and paid to get a good design. (B) He puts all the needed elements into the advertisement.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jerry turned to an enterprises and paid to get a good design.\nExplanation: Since Jerry was in need of a design for his company's logo, the most plausible answer would be that he turned to a professional design company or freelancer to create a good design. Option B, putting all the needed elements into the advertisement, does not address the need for a logo design and is not a viable solution. Therefore, option A is the more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "Their prey can escape the catastrophe at this time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Loggerheads atre abundant in the sea. (B) Some animals hibernate in winter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Some animals hibernate in winter, which means they go into a state of deep sleep and reduce their metabolic rate to conserve energy. This allows them to survive harsh winter conditions and avoid being preyed upon. Therefore, it is possible that the prey in question were hibernating during the catastrophe and were able to escape unharmed. Option A, stating that loggerheads are abundant in the sea, does not provide a plausible explanation for why the prey were able to escape the catastrophe."}}
{"Q": "I bought fruit for it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had a margay. (B) Air and moisture are essential for plants to grow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because it explains a logical reason for buying fruit. Fruits come from plants, and plants need air and moisture to grow. Therefore, buying fruit could be a result of understanding the importance of these elements for plant growth and wanting to incorporate more fruits into one's diet. Option A, on the other hand, is not a logical explanation for buying fruit as having a margay (a type of wild cat) has no direct correlation with purchasing fruit."}}
{"Q": "He wanted some paraffin. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He created a substitution reaction. (B) He was looking for paraffin in the trash.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: He obtained paraffin.\nExplanation: The sentence simply states that the person wanted paraffin, which implies that they were able to obtain it. There is no information provided to suggest that a substitution reaction occurred or that they were searching for paraffin in the trash. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that they were able to obtain the paraffin they wanted."}}
{"Q": "The summary of Tom's paper had a mistake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He asked Emily to help decide. (B) Professors picked the mistake up immediately.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that professors picked up the mistake immediately as they are experts in the field and would be able to identify errors in a summary. It is unlikely that Tom would ask Emily to help decide as she may not have the necessary expertise to identify the mistake."}}
{"Q": "The altimeter malfunctions and fails to measurie atmospheric pressure. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He grows taller than other classmates. (B) The plane's altitude cannot be determined.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The plane's altitude cannot be determined.\nExplanation: An altimeter measures the atmospheric pressure to determine the altitude of an aircraft. If it malfunctions and fails to measure atmospheric pressure, the altitude of the plane cannot be determined accurately. This can be dangerous as the pilot needs to know the altitude to avoid collisions with other aircraft and obstacles on the ground. It is unlikely that the malfunction of an altimeter would cause a person to grow taller than their classmates."}}
{"Q": "Steven yearns for the results of the college entrance examination. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She observed them carefully. (B) Naturally, Steven is always in a state of anxiety.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Naturally, Steven is always in a state of anxiety.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that Steven is eagerly waiting for the results of the college entrance examination, which suggests that he is anxious about the outcome. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it aligns with the context of the sentence. Option A does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Silk has different variations. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The high temperature is changing the solid to liquid. (B) Tom put sweat, tears and saliva on the silk.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The high temperature is changing the solid to liquid.\nExplanation: Silk has different variations due to the different ways it is produced and processed. One of the factors that can affect the quality and texture of silk is the temperature at which it is produced. Higher temperatures can cause the silk fibers to become more elastic and stretchy, while lower temperatures can make them more brittle and prone to breaking. Therefore, it is more plausible that the variation in silk is caused by temperature rather than the addition of sweat, tears, and saliva."}}
{"Q": "He thought he can fly even when awake. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike became a superman in the film. (B) Mike became a superman in his dreams.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Mike became a superman in his dreams.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mike's belief that he can fly was a result of his dream rather than becoming a superman in a film. Dreams can often feel very real and can influence our thoughts and beliefs even when we are awake. It is not uncommon for people to have vivid dreams of flying or having superpowers, which can sometimes lead to a temporary belief that they possess these abilities in waking life."}}
{"Q": "The fly was eaten by the spider. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The gardener was asked to kill the insects in the garden. (B) A fly was capture by a spider.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. A fly was captured by a spider.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the spider caught and ate the fly, as this is a natural occurrence in the food chain. Choice A, about a gardener killing insects, is not directly related to the fly being eaten by the spider."}}
{"Q": "Now we are tourists. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The success of reproducing flowers he dreamed of was influenced. (B) We start our trips.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. We start our trips.\nExplanation: The statement \"Now we are tourists\" implies that the speaker and/or the group they are referring to have started their travels as tourists. There is no indication that this event would have any direct impact on the success of reproducing flowers, making option A less plausible. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "There is a bee on the periwinkle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The periwinkle has no reaction. (B) The periwinkle attracts a lot of butterflies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The periwinkle has no reaction.\n\nExplanation: Periwinkles are not known to have any specific reaction to bees. While bees may be attracted to the flowers of the periwinkle plant, there is no evidence to suggest that the presence of a bee would cause any significant change in the behavior or appearance of the plant. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B, which suggests that the periwinkle attracts a lot of butterflies, is not supported by any known facts about the plant."}}
{"Q": "The amateur observed the shape of moon via images from satellites. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A kind of Emulsion was produced. (B) Its shape ranges from highly irregular to sphere.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Its shape ranges from highly irregular to sphere.\nExplanation: Observing the shape of the moon via images from satellites can provide information about the moon's topography and shape. The moon's shape is not perfectly spherical, but rather ranges from highly irregular to somewhat spherical. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A, the production of emulsion, is not related to the observation of the moon's shape via satellite images."}}
{"Q": "His father told him it was just a manifestation of volcanic activity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John is shocked by the unusual shape of this creature. (B) The villager was terrified of the geysers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The cause of this was volcanic activity.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the father told his son that the phenomenon was a manifestation of volcanic activity. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). The other option, (B), is not related to the given information and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Parents are more traditional than children. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Parents have diffrent styles from children. (B) The boy's mother bought spinach for him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Parents have different styles from children.\nExplanation: This statement suggests that parents hold onto traditional values and beliefs, while their children may have more modern or progressive views. As a result, there may be differences in the way parents and children approach various aspects of life, such as education, career, relationships, and social norms. This can lead to conflicts or misunderstandings between generations, but it can also create opportunities for learning and growth. The statement does not provide any information about a specific incident involving spinach, so option B is not relevant."}}
{"Q": "Tom mixex some reactants together in a beaker to see what will happen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The beaker becomes too hot and breaks into pieces. (B) The boy was naturalized into the Smith family.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that mixing reactants together in a beaker could cause a chemical reaction that generates heat, potentially causing the beaker to become too hot and break. Option B is not related to the scenario and does not make sense as a possible outcome."}}
{"Q": "Too many calories do a lot of harm to human body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It's the side effect after having narcotics. (B) The current trend is to restrict calorie intake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The current trend is to restrict calorie intake.\nExplanation: Consuming too many calories can lead to weight gain, which in turn can increase the risk of various health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Therefore, it is recommended to limit calorie intake to maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of these health problems. This is why the current trend is to restrict calorie intake. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the harmful effects of consuming too many calories."}}
{"Q": "She doesn't believe for her unffected visual acuity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My grandma was diagnoised as cataract. (B) Lucy always bought something unnecessary.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The diagnosis of cataract in the grandmother is more likely to be related to the visual acuity of the person in question. Cataracts can be hereditary, and if the grandmother has been diagnosed with it, it is possible that the person in question may also have it. Cataracts can cause blurry vision, glare, and difficulty seeing at night, which can affect visual acuity. On the other hand, buying unnecessary things has no direct correlation with visual acuity."}}
{"Q": "She will be relieved. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Maria listens to music when she is in a bad mood. (B) On December 16, 1902, the eruption of Mount Peree in the West Indies shook the world.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Maria listens to music when she is in a bad mood.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Maria was in a bad mood and listening to music helped her feel better, leading to a sense of relief. On the other hand, option B is not related to Maria's situation and seems like a random event that has no connection to the given statement."}}
{"Q": "He melted some ice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to made some cider. (B) Tom forgot to bring water to do the experiment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom forgot to bring water to do the experiment, so he melted some ice as a substitute. This is a common solution when someone needs water but doesn't have any readily available. Making cider (choice A) does not require melted ice, and there is no indication in the sentence that Tom was making cider."}}
{"Q": "Tom took a lot of antibiotics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Now he is immune to chickenpox. (B) The doctor prescribed him a lot of probiotics to keep him healthy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Taking a lot of antibiotics can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the gut, leading to digestive issues and a weakened immune system. To counteract this, doctors may prescribe probiotics to help restore the balance of good bacteria in the gut and support overall health. Antibiotics do not provide immunity to chickenpox or any other viral infection."}}
{"Q": "Her parents invites her to take a trip together. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sharry was busy with her study recently and she felt tired. (B) Brown wants to buy some anti-gallng binder.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Sharry has been busy with her studies and feels tired suggests that her parents may have invited her on a trip to help her relax and take a break from her academic responsibilities. On the other hand, the mention of Brown wanting to buy an anti-galling binder seems unrelated to the situation and does not provide a plausible explanation for why Sharry's parents would invite her on a trip."}}
{"Q": "Cats eat mice. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cats are dead. (B) They have kept an ecological balance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They have kept an ecological balance.\nExplanation: Cats are natural predators of mice and play an important role in controlling their population. If cats were not present to hunt mice, their population would increase rapidly, leading to a decrease in the population of their prey and an imbalance in the ecosystem. Therefore, the presence of cats helps to maintain a balance in the food chain and ecosystem. It is unlikely that cats would become extinct as a result of eating mice, as they have evolved to hunt and eat small prey."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have detected toxic substances. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists test soldiers' excrement. (B) A chemist examined the chemicals contained in marijuana.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Scientists testing soldiers' excrement is a more plausible cause for detecting toxic substances as soldiers may have been exposed to various toxins during their service. On the other hand, examining the chemicals contained in marijuana may not necessarily lead to the detection of toxic substances, as marijuana is not typically known to contain harmful toxins."}}
{"Q": "She got tired of announcing similar result involving prizes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The hostess joined in so many host contests. (B) The hostess hosted so many different contests.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The hostess hosted so many different contests.\nExplanation: If the hostess hosted many different contests, it is likely that she had to announce the results of each contest, which could become repetitive and tiring. On the other hand, if she only joined in many host contests (option A), she would not necessarily have to announce the results herself, as someone else would be hosting the contest. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jackson's father is going to build a house. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jackson's uncle brought in the machines. (B) He bought much wood.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He bought much wood.\nExplanation: If Jackson's father is going to build a house, it is more plausible that he would need to purchase a significant amount of wood for the construction. While it is possible that Jackson's uncle could bring in machines to assist with the building process, it is less likely to be the immediate result of Jackson's father's decision to build a house."}}
{"Q": "He heated the water to almost 100 degrees when he saw the vapour. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John wants to see the water vapour. (B) Tom's experiment produced some methanol gas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that John wanted to see the water vapour. Heating water to almost 100 degrees Celsius causes it to boil and produce steam or water vapour. It is a common phenomenon that occurs when water is heated, and there is no indication in the question that any other substance was added to the water that could produce a different type of gas. Therefore, it is more likely that John was simply heating the water to observe the vapour."}}
{"Q": "They had an accident in their Jeep. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The windows were broken but they were safe. (B) The oil splashed wet people nearby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The windows were broken but they were safe.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is common for a Jeep to have a roll-over accident, which could result in broken windows. However, the fact that they were safe suggests that they were wearing seat belts and the Jeep had proper safety features. Option B is less likely as it is not a common result of a Jeep accident and seems unlikely to happen."}}
{"Q": "Woody deciduous plants become bold and brown in late autumn. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Grapevines become bold and brown in late autumn. (B) Gardeners will prevent this plant from growing in gardens.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Grapevines become bold and brown in late autumn.\nExplanation: The statement is describing a characteristic of woody deciduous plants, which is that they turn bold and brown in late autumn. This does not necessarily mean that gardeners will prevent them from growing in gardens. Choice A is a more plausible answer because grapevines are a type of woody deciduous plant that is known to turn bold and brown in late autumn."}}
{"Q": "Soon it froze to death. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He threw some apple cores in his garden. (B) They put the monarchs in the refrigerator.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They put the monarchs in the refrigerator.\nExplanation: Monarch butterflies are cold-blooded insects and cannot survive in cold temperatures. Putting them in the refrigerator would have caused them to become too cold and eventually freeze to death. Throwing apple cores in the garden would not have directly caused the death of the monarchs."}}
{"Q": "His mother bought some foxgloves home. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted some flowers to decorate his bedroom. (B) Tom wants a house where he can dry his clothes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom wanted some flowers to decorate his bedroom.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom's mother bought foxgloves suggests that she bought them for a specific purpose. Since foxgloves are flowers, it is more likely that Tom's mother bought them for decorative purposes rather than for drying clothes. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom and Lucy divorced. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Children were adjudged to be adopted by their mother. (B) Resonance occurred.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Children were adjudged to be adopted by their mother.\nExplanation: In a divorce, the court usually decides on the custody of the children. In this case, it is likely that the court awarded custody of the children to the mother, and she became their legal guardian. Adoption is not typically a result of divorce, unless one of the parents is giving up their parental rights and the other parent is adopting the child. Resonance is not relevant to this situation."}}
{"Q": "Her parents invites her to take a trip together. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Farmers want to improve the ablity of legume crops to fix their own nitrogen. (B) Sharry was busy with her study recently and she felt tired.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of her parents inviting her to take a trip together is that Sharry was busy with her study recently and she felt tired. This is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the situation of the question and is a common reason for parents to invite their children on a trip to relax and unwind. Option A is unrelated to the question and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "They structured a healthy ecosystem. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) All creatures in nature are in balance. (B) Kelps have a strong ability of adaptation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that a healthy ecosystem was structured, which implies that all creatures in nature are in balance. This is a fundamental principle of ecology, where each organism plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. If one species becomes too dominant or goes extinct, it can have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem. Therefore, it is more plausible that the healthy ecosystem was structured due to the balance of all creatures in nature rather than the strong ability of adaptation of kelps."}}
{"Q": "I saw many triggerfish in underwater wolrd in Maldives. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy was scared. (B) They have very beautiful colors.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: They have very beautiful colors.\nExplanation: Triggerfish are known for their vibrant and striking colors, which can range from blues and greens to yellows and oranges. Seeing many triggerfish in the underwater world of Maldives would likely result in an appreciation for their beauty and colors, rather than fear."}}
{"Q": "He always does researches about mental activities of human beings. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientist wants to research human. (B) Tom is a student who was majoring in psychology.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Tom being a student majoring in psychology is a more plausible answer as it explains why he is interested in researching mental activities of human beings. It is common for psychology students to conduct research on various aspects of human behavior and mental processes. Therefore, it is likely that Tom's interest in this area is due to his academic pursuits."}}
{"Q": "His skin is very dry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He used body moisture and got better. (B) The doctor diagnosed him with mumps.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He used body moisture and got better.\nExplanation: Dry skin is a common condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, such as cold weather, low humidity, harsh soaps, and certain medical conditions. To treat dry skin, one can use moisturizers to help restore the skin's natural moisture barrier. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person used body moisture (i.e., moisturizers) to improve their dry skin condition rather than being diagnosed with mumps, which is a viral infection that causes swelling of the salivary glands."}}
{"Q": "People have two faces towards family and others. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is no quarrel at home. (B) The feeling of drowsiness often occurs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There is no quarrel at home.\nExplanation: When people have two faces towards family and others, they tend to behave differently in different situations. They may put on a facade or act differently to impress others, but when they are with their family, they tend to be more relaxed and show their true selves. This can lead to a harmonious and peaceful environment at home, as there is no need to pretend or impress anyone. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B, feeling drowsy, does not seem to be related to the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "The director asked the staff about the product knowledge. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The staff took use of codes instead of spoken words. (B) The staff was able to answer them all.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The staff was able to answer them all.\nExplanation: Since the director asked about product knowledge, it is likely that the staff had to demonstrate their knowledge by answering questions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the staff was able to answer all the questions rather than resorting to using codes instead of spoken words."}}
{"Q": "He was afriad of the appearance of mice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The gardener kept a cat on this land. (B) The gardener sowed grass seed on this land.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The gardener kept a cat on this land.\nExplanation: It is a common knowledge that cats are natural predators of mice. Therefore, if the gardener kept a cat on the land, it is likely that the mice population would be controlled, and the person would not be afraid of their appearance. On the other hand, sowing grass seed on the land does not have any direct correlation with the fear of mice."}}
{"Q": "The teacher played games with him and other children. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was sent to the kindergarten. (B) Geography teacher uses a globe to teach students about geography.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom was sent to the kindergarten. The sentence mentions that the teacher played games with him and other children, which suggests that the teacher is likely a kindergarten or elementary school teacher. Playing games is a common activity in kindergarten and elementary school classrooms, as it helps children learn and develop social skills. On the other hand, the use of a globe to teach geography is not directly related to the sentence and does not provide a clear explanation for why the teacher played games with the children."}}
{"Q": "Blood brings oxygen to thw body in this way. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Blood runs through the body via vessels. (B) Tom attach too much importance to his shoes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Blood brings oxygen to the body through vessels, specifically through the network of arteries, veins, and capillaries. Oxygenated blood is pumped from the heart through the arteries to the body's tissues, where it releases oxygen and picks up carbon dioxide. The deoxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the veins to be re-oxygenated. This process is essential for the body's survival and is facilitated by the circulatory system. Choice B is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the question and does not provide a logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "The car doesn't work any more. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Close the S pole of magnet A to the N pole of magnet B. (B) The metal on the gearbox is oxidized.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The metal on the gearbox is oxidized.\nExplanation: While option A may cause some issues with the car's electrical system, it is unlikely to completely disable the car. On the other hand, oxidation of the metal on the gearbox can cause significant damage and prevent the car from functioning properly. Over time, exposure to moisture and air can cause the metal to corrode and weaken, leading to mechanical failure. Therefore, option B is a more plausible cause for the car not working anymore."}}
{"Q": "He was blamed for insult the religious paintings. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom accidentally touched the clay sculpture. (B) He urinated beside the icons.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Urinating beside religious icons is a highly disrespectful and offensive act in many cultures and religions. It is a plausible cause for being blamed for insulting religious paintings. Accidentally touching a clay sculpture, while potentially damaging, would not necessarily be seen as insulting to religious paintings."}}
{"Q": "They helped kill bacteria they have engulfed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack planted beets in the cool outdoors and in the warm greenhouse. (B) The Phagocytes utilized oxidants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The Phagocytes utilized oxidants.\nExplanation: Phagocytes are a type of white blood cell that engulf and digest bacteria and other harmful microorganisms. They use a process called phagocytosis to engulf the bacteria, and then utilize oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid to kill the bacteria. Choice A, about planting beets in different environments, is not related to the process of phagocytosis and bacterial killing."}}
{"Q": "The tardigrades began to curled themselves up into a little ball called a tun. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The dry season is here. (B) It's been windy lately.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The dry season is here.\nExplanation: Tardigrades are known for their ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation (drying out). When faced with a lack of water, tardigrades will enter a state called tun formation, where they curl up into a ball and enter a dormant state until conditions improve. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the tardigrades are responding to the onset of the dry season by entering tun formation. Windy conditions would not necessarily trigger this response."}}
{"Q": "They live in wilderness regions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Those men are hikers. (B) This kind of animal mainly preys on Scavengers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the reason for people living in wilderness regions is related to the presence of a certain type of animal that preys on scavengers. This implies that the region may not be suitable for other types of animals or agriculture, making it difficult for people to settle there. Therefore, option B seems to be a more plausible answer. Option A, on the other hand, does not provide any explanation for why people would choose to live in wilderness regions."}}
{"Q": "His elphant is watching a bird that is really far. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The elephant can't see it clear. (B) The elephant wants to eat it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The elephant can't see it clear.\nExplanation: Elephants have poor eyesight and are nearsighted, which means they can't see objects that are far away clearly. Therefore, it is more plausible that the elephant can't see the bird clearly rather than wanting to eat it."}}
{"Q": "They live well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The sunlight is there for the pineapples everyday. (B) Antelopes often migrate.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The sunlight is there for the pineapples everyday.\nExplanation: The statement \"They live well\" suggests that the subject being referred to is thriving or doing well. The cause of this is given in option A, which states that the pineapples receive sunlight every day. Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants produce their food. Therefore, if the pineapples are receiving sunlight every day, they are likely growing well and producing a good yield, which could contribute to the overall well-being of the ecosystem they are a part of. Option B, which suggests that antelopes often migrate, is not a plausible answer as it is not directly related to the well-being of the subject being referred to."}}
{"Q": "There are much more creatures in the sea than on land. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Brachiopods occupy a large part of marine creatures. (B) It needs a lot of people to explore it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Brachiopods are a type of marine creature that have been around for millions of years and are still present in large numbers today. They are filter feeders that live on the ocean floor and are found in all parts of the world's oceans. Due to the vast number of creatures in the sea, it is not surprising that brachiopods occupy a large part of marine creatures. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B is not a valid explanation as it does not relate to the statement that there are more creatures in the sea than on land."}}
{"Q": "Linda is good at typing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She can not find a job. (B) She is hired by a potent company for her potential to make interest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She is hired by a potent company for her potential to make interest.\nExplanation: Linda's skill in typing makes her a valuable asset to companies that require fast and accurate typing, such as data entry or transcription. Therefore, it is more plausible that she would be hired by a company that recognizes her potential to contribute to their productivity and profitability. It is unlikely that her skill would prevent her from finding a job."}}
{"Q": "There are many little frogs in the pond. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The number of weeds in the pond grew greatly. (B) Tom put some frog eggs in the pond at home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the presence of little frogs in the pond is due to someone intentionally introducing frog eggs into the pond, rather than the sudden growth of weeds. Additionally, the fact that the frogs are specifically \"little\" suggests that they are newly hatched, which supports the idea that they were introduced as eggs rather than growing naturally in the pond."}}
{"Q": "Blair's answer is narration. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher asked what is the translation from printed matter to spoken language. (B) This passage discusses the structure of dominant genes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The question is asking for the cause of Blair's answer being narration. Option A states that the teacher asked a question related to the translation from printed matter to spoken language, which could have prompted Blair to provide a narration as an answer. Option B is unrelated to the question and does not provide a plausible explanation for Blair's answer. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of Blair's answer being narration."}}
{"Q": "He had to make instruments. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wants to control noise. (B) Jerry was making a plane.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jerry was making a plane.\nExplanation: The sentence does not provide any information about the person's intention to control noise. However, it mentions that Jerry was making a plane, which could require the person to make instruments such as gauges, controls, or navigation tools. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Logan lacks red blood cells in his body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Doctors inject some erythropoietin into his bone marrow. (B) He developed acute hemolytic anemia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: If Logan lacks red blood cells in his body, it means he has a condition called anemia. One of the treatments for anemia is to inject erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells, into the bone marrow. This helps to increase the number of red blood cells in the body and improve the symptoms of anemia. Option B, acute hemolytic anemia, is a condition where the body destroys its own red blood cells, which is not related to Logan's lack of red blood cells."}}
{"Q": "Mary was pregnant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary suffered from heartburn. (B) The doctor said that she can begin her normal delivery because of the diameter of her cervix has reached the standard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The doctor said that she can begin her normal delivery because of the diameter of her cervix has reached the standard.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Mary's pregnancy and the progress of her labor. Heartburn is a common symptom during pregnancy, but it does not necessarily have a direct impact on the delivery process. On the other hand, the diameter of the cervix is a crucial factor in determining when a woman can begin delivering her baby. Therefore, it is more likely that the doctor would make a decision based on this factor rather than heartburn."}}
{"Q": "This polite sentence instantly turned into a curse. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The class was broken by a call of the teacher. (B) Tom added a modal particle to the sentence.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom added a modal particle to the sentence.\nExplanation: Modal particles are words that are added to a sentence to convey a speaker's attitude or mood. In some languages, including Chinese, adding certain modal particles can change the meaning of a sentence drastically. Therefore, it is plausible that Tom added a modal particle that turned the polite sentence into a curse."}}
{"Q": "Tom suffered convulsions. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has an electrical malfunction of the brain. (B) His intestinal peristalsis was inhibited, affecting the digestive system.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has an electrical malfunction of the brain.\nExplanation: Convulsions are involuntary muscle contractions caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. This can be due to various reasons such as epilepsy, head injury, or infection. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the cause of convulsions. Option B is less likely as it refers to the digestive system, which is not directly related to convulsions."}}
{"Q": "Lily has a sudden cardiac arrest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Some regions in her brain can’t be connected with other regions. (B) Lily died of cerebral ischemia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Some regions in her brain can't be connected with other regions.\nExplanation: Sudden cardiac arrest can cause a lack of oxygen supply to the brain, leading to damage to brain cells. However, cerebral ischemia, which is a lack of blood flow to the brain, is not the immediate cause of death in sudden cardiac arrest. Instead, the lack of oxygen supply to the brain can cause damage to the neural connections between different regions of the brain, leading to neurological deficits. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom put the maggots in ice water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They're all dead. (B) She put some vegetables into it.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They're all dead.\nExplanation: Maggots are cold-blooded organisms and cannot regulate their body temperature. When exposed to extreme cold temperatures, such as ice water, their metabolic processes slow down, and they eventually die. Therefore, it is plausible that the maggots died as a result of being put in ice water. Choice B, which suggests that vegetables were added to the ice water, is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the action of putting maggots in ice water."}}
{"Q": "He ate broccolis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John wanted to take in extra nutrients. (B) The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John wanted to take in extra nutrients.\nExplanation: Eating broccoli is a common way to increase nutrient intake, as it is a good source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. The second option, about myofibrils and myofilaments, is unrelated to the topic of broccoli consumption and does not provide a plausible explanation for why someone would eat broccoli."}}
{"Q": "He is very knowledgeable. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom likes reading books. (B) Jack is a physician.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom likes reading books.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that someone who is knowledgeable has gained their knowledge through reading books and other sources of information, rather than simply being a physician (as in option B). While being a physician may require a certain level of knowledge, it does not necessarily mean that the person is knowledgeable in other areas. On the other hand, someone who enjoys reading books is likely to have a broader range of knowledge and interests."}}
{"Q": "The number of workers on the square being employed is more than the number of those in the company. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They kept a a flock of sheep. (B) There are more workers on the square than in the company.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. There are more workers on the square than in the company.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly addresses the statement given in the question. It suggests that there are more workers employed on the square (presumably a public space or marketplace) than in the company (which could be a private business or organization). Option A, on the other hand, mentions keeping a flock of sheep, which is not directly related to the number of workers employed. Therefore, option B is a more logical and relevant answer."}}
{"Q": "They will take actions for contraception. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy and Tom are not ready for the coming of a baby. (B) Scientists admit that females suffer from sexual reproduction.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Lucy and Tom are not ready for the coming of a baby.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the need for contraception. Lucy and Tom have made the decision that they are not ready to have a baby, and therefore, they are taking actions to prevent pregnancy. Option B, on the other hand, is not a direct cause for the need for contraception and is not a widely accepted scientific statement."}}
{"Q": "They are having a lunch break. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's mother bought some lemons for Tom to eat. (B) It is about 3锛00pm now.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) It is about 3:00pm now.\nExplanation: The fact that they are having a lunch break does not provide any information or context to suggest that Tom's mother bought lemons for him to eat. On the other hand, the time of day is a plausible result of a lunch break, as it is typically taken around midday and 3:00pm is a reasonable time for the break to be over."}}
{"Q": "He is allergic to dust. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom suffers from asthma. (B) The soldier is afraid of explosions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom suffers from asthma.\nExplanation: Asthma is a respiratory condition that can cause inflammation and narrowing of the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Allergies, including dust allergies, can trigger asthma symptoms. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's allergy to dust is a symptom of his asthma rather than being afraid of explosions, which is unrelated to respiratory issues."}}
{"Q": "I observed  the natural ends the tips of a linear chromosome through the microscope. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ions are the same as atoms. (B) After looking at the data, I learned that it is called telomere.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: When observing the natural ends of a linear chromosome through a microscope, one would see that the ends have a distinct structure called telomeres. Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences that protect the ends of chromosomes from degradation and fusion with other chromosomes. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer as it directly relates to the observation made through the microscope. Option A is not related to the observation and is incorrect."}}
{"Q": "He's under arrest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The thief sneaked into the house on a dark night. (B) He has embezzled money from the public fund.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of his arrest is that he has embezzled money from the public fund. This is a more plausible answer as embezzlement is a criminal offense that can lead to arrest, while sneaking into a house on a dark night may not necessarily result in arrest unless a crime was committed."}}
{"Q": "Andy saw a hellbound in my house yesterday. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It must be her imagination. (B) I went downstairs to find that there was indeed a fight going on.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: If Andy saw a hellhound in the house, it is unlikely to be her imagination. Therefore, the more plausible answer would be that there was indeed a fight going on downstairs. It is possible that the hellhound was involved in the fight or that it was a result of the fight. Either way, it is more likely that there was some sort of physical evidence or disturbance that led to the discovery of the fight."}}
{"Q": "Some people does not believe intuition. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Moving from places is like migration. (B) Intuition cannot be tested yet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Intuition cannot be tested yet.\nExplanation: Some people do not believe in intuition because it is not a tangible or measurable concept. It cannot be tested in a scientific way, and therefore, some people may dismiss it as unreliable or unimportant. However, many people still value intuition as a valuable tool for decision-making and problem-solving, even if it cannot be quantified or proven in a traditional sense."}}
{"Q": "There is no water in the soil. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The farmer has put a pond liner on the road. (B) The man poured too much nutrient solution into the pond.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the farmer has put a pond liner on the road. This would prevent water from seeping into the soil and could cause a lack of water in the soil. Pouring too much nutrient solution into a pond would not directly affect the water content in the soil."}}
{"Q": "The sick people were biten. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The dog brought fleas to the ward. (B) Megakaryocytes pinched off small cell fragments.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The dog brought fleas to the ward.\nExplanation: Fleas are known to carry and transmit diseases, including those that can cause illness in humans. If the sick people were bitten, it is possible that the dog brought fleas into the ward, which then bit the patients. Megakaryocytes, on the other hand, are cells involved in blood clotting and do not have a direct connection to flea bites or the transmission of diseases. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The workers are required to protect topsoil from wind erosion. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They built a dam. (B) They planted rows of trees as shelterbelts.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They planted rows of trees as shelterbelts.\nExplanation: Planting rows of trees as shelterbelts is a common method used to protect topsoil from wind erosion. The trees act as a barrier, reducing wind speed and preventing soil from being blown away. Building a dam would not be an effective method for protecting topsoil from wind erosion."}}
{"Q": "Scientists named it tolerance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researchers found a special kind of aquatic plant in the lake water sample. (B) Scientists are studying the state of unresponsiveness to a specific known antigen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Tolerance refers to the state of unresponsiveness to a specific known antigen. This is a term commonly used in immunology and refers to the ability of the immune system to recognize and tolerate self-antigens while mounting an immune response against foreign antigens. It is unlikely that the term tolerance would be used to describe the discovery of a new aquatic plant in a lake water sample."}}
{"Q": "Researchers found a primate that ate leaves in the forest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They are called langurs in the literature. (B) It became a human.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They are called langurs in the literature.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that researchers discovered a new primate species that feeds on leaves in the forest. Therefore, it is more plausible that the researchers named the primate and identified it as a langur, which is a type of leaf-eating primate found in Asia, rather than it transforming into a human."}}
{"Q": "He shouldn't have contact with electricity to avoid electric shock. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has insulator on his fingers. (B) He has rainwater on his fingers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He has rainwater on his fingers.\nExplanation: Rainwater is a good conductor of electricity, and if someone has rainwater on their fingers, it can create a path for electricity to flow through their body, causing electric shock. Insulators, on the other hand, prevent the flow of electricity and would actually protect someone from electric shock. Therefore, (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The hunter intended to make the warble uglier. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He plucked all its plumages. (B) He went to mangrove areas.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He plucked all its plumages.\nExplanation: Plucking all the plumages of a bird would definitely make it look uglier. On the other hand, going to mangrove areas would not necessarily make the warble uglier. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Einstein accumulated experience in barriers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He eventually succeeded in becoming a great inventor. (B) Tom walked safely over the wires.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He eventually succeeded in becoming a great inventor.\nExplanation: Einstein faced many obstacles and challenges throughout his life, including discrimination, rejection from universities, and difficulty finding employment. However, he persevered and continued to pursue his passion for science and mathematics. His experiences with barriers likely helped him develop resilience and problem-solving skills, which ultimately contributed to his success as a great inventor and scientist."}}
{"Q": "The flakes fell on the back of penguins. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The capes protected them from getting wet. (B) They shook their backs off the flakes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They shook their backs off the flakes.\nExplanation: Penguins have a special oil on their feathers that helps repel water and keep them dry. The flakes falling on their backs would not have caused them to get wet, so option A is not plausible. However, penguins are known to shake their bodies vigorously to remove any debris or snow that may have accumulated on their feathers, so option B is a more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "This book introduces changes in the state of something. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This is a book about dynamics. (B) This book is about physics.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This is a book about dynamics.\nExplanation: Dynamics is the study of how things change over time, including changes in the state of objects. Therefore, it is more plausible that this book introduces changes in the state of something due to its focus on dynamics rather than physics, which is a broader field that encompasses many different topics."}}
{"Q": "One of Tom's ramjet needs energy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom added some paraffin oil to the ramjet. (B) He listened to music in it for the whole day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom added some paraffin oil to the ramjet.\nExplanation: Ramjets require fuel to operate, and paraffin oil is a common fuel used in ramjets. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom added paraffin oil to the ramjet to provide it with the necessary energy to function. Listening to music in the ramjet would not provide any energy to the engine and is not a logical solution to the problem."}}
{"Q": "The Chinese commander said that thanks to the right strategy,. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Chinese army showed super capacity in the war and won a great victory. (B) He ate a whole cantaloupe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The Chinese commander's statement suggests that the right strategy was the reason for their success in the war. Option A is the most plausible answer as it aligns with the commander's statement and is a common reason for winning a war. Option B is not a logical explanation and is unlikely to be the cause of their victory."}}
{"Q": "The one-year-old Tom's teeth began to stick out of his gums. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's mother said he was teething. (B) When the roots of the baby teeth is deep, people pull them out on their own.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom's mother said he was teething.\nExplanation: When a baby's teeth begin to stick out of their gums, it is a sign that they are teething. This is a normal process that occurs as the baby's teeth start to emerge. It is not common for people to pull out baby teeth on their own, especially when the roots are deep. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was bited a lot by mosquitoes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John has experienced field survival. (B) Jack is not feeling well.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John has experienced field survival.\nExplanation: When someone is in a field survival situation, they are often exposed to outdoor elements such as mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are attracted to the carbon dioxide that humans exhale and can bite multiple times, causing irritation and discomfort. Therefore, it is more plausible that John's exposure to the outdoors during field survival caused him to be bitten by mosquitoes. Option B, that Jack is not feeling well, does not provide a clear connection to mosquito bites."}}
{"Q": "The trees almost all died. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Farmers planted some trees in the zone. (B) There is a big tamarisk tree growing in the forests.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The presence of farmers planting trees in the zone could have caused the trees to almost all die. This could be due to improper planting techniques, lack of proper care, or the use of harmful chemicals. On the other hand, the presence of a big tamarisk tree growing in the forests may not necessarily be the cause of the trees dying, as tamarisk trees are not known to be harmful to other trees."}}
{"Q": "Penicillin is now outdated because our excess use of it. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Researchers produced Penicillinases to deal with this problem. (B) The scientists have invented replacements.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The scientists have invented replacements.\nExplanation: Overuse of penicillin has led to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it less effective in treating infections. As a result, scientists have been working on developing new antibiotics to replace penicillin and combat antibiotic resistance. Therefore, it is more plausible that scientists have invented replacements rather than producing penicillinases to deal with the problem."}}
{"Q": "The baby is growing up. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He feeds all kinds of animals three meals a day. (B) He can't wear his former clothes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He can't wear his former clothes.\nExplanation: As the baby grows up, their body size and shape change, which means that the clothes they used to wear will no longer fit them. This is a common occurrence as children grow and develop. Feeding animals three meals a day (option A) is not necessarily related to the baby growing up and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Wang was infected by the bacteria. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Wang breathed small droplets of water contaminated by the bacteria. (B) Wang breathed small droplets of water purified for the bacteria.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Wang breathed small droplets of water contaminated by the bacteria.\n\nExplanation: Bacteria can be present in water sources and can contaminate the air when small droplets of water containing the bacteria are released into the air. Breathing in these contaminated droplets can lead to infection. Therefore, it is more plausible that Wang was infected by breathing in small droplets of water contaminated by the bacteria rather than purified water."}}
{"Q": "These years he had accumulated abundant experience. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He became experienced. (B) He had evolution more quickly.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He became experienced.\nExplanation: Accumulating experience over time leads to an increase in knowledge, skills, and expertise in a particular field. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person became experienced rather than having evolution more quickly, which is not a scientifically supported concept in the context of human experience."}}
{"Q": "Tom is making steamed buns. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He likes eating steamed buns. (B) He put some amines in the bowl.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The question only mentions that Tom is making steamed buns, but does not provide any information about him adding amines to the bowl. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it is a common result of making food that one enjoys eating it."}}
{"Q": "The potatoes he grew had russet disease and were therefore inedible. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Streptomyces scabies found in soil where John grew potatoes. (B) Mr. Wang, 30, wants to choose an investment method to prepare for retirement.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Streptomyces scabies found in soil where John grew potatoes.\nExplanation: Russet disease is caused by a bacterial pathogen called Streptomyces scabies, which is commonly found in soil. This pathogen infects the potato plant and causes scab-like lesions on the surface of the potato, making it inedible. Therefore, it is likely that the cause of the russet disease in the potatoes grown by John was the presence of Streptomyces scabies in the soil where he grew the potatoes."}}
{"Q": "It flies to a plant stem. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The kestrel wants to find a leaf as a lookout. (B) The Sawfly is to lay eggs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The Sawfly is to lay eggs.\nExplanation: Sawflies are known to lay their eggs on plant stems, as their larvae feed on the leaves of the plant. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the fly flying to the plant stem is to lay eggs rather than a kestrel looking for a lookout."}}
{"Q": "He felt noticeably more relaxed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The professor listened to the whole demonstration. (B) Tom listens to music when he is tired of studying.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The professor listened to the whole demonstration.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person in question felt more relaxed after something happened. Option A states that the professor listened to the whole demonstration, which could have been informative or entertaining, leading to the person feeling more relaxed. Option B is not a plausible answer as it talks about Tom's habit of listening to music when he is tired of studying, which is not related to the given context. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They can be easily hurt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gastropods are relatively soft. (B) Hippos are violent.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Gastropods are relatively soft.\nExplanation: Gastropods, such as snails and slugs, have soft bodies that lack a protective shell or other hard structures. This makes them vulnerable to injury from predators, environmental hazards, and even accidental damage from human activities. Therefore, it is more plausible that the vulnerability of gastropods to injury is due to their soft bodies rather than the behavior of hippos, which are not typically associated with harming gastropods."}}
{"Q": "Tom followed the flamingo to go back their habitat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He witnessed death. (B) He found that there are a lot of flamingos.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He found that there are a lot of flamingos.\nExplanation: Since Tom followed the flamingo to go back to their habitat, it is more likely that he found a group of flamingos in their natural habitat rather than witnessing death. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I had a Colonoscopy check. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I got terrifed of the instrument for examining the whole colon. (B) The diagnosis showed that this was prolapse.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The diagnosis showed that this was prolapse.\nExplanation: A colonoscopy is a medical procedure that allows a doctor to examine the inside of the colon for any abnormalities or diseases. If the diagnosis showed that the individual had prolapse, it means that there was a displacement of an organ or tissue from its normal position. This could be a serious condition that requires further medical attention and treatment. It is unlikely that the individual would be terrified of the instrument used for the examination as it is a routine procedure and the doctor would have provided adequate information and reassurance beforehand."}}
{"Q": "Frozen chickens weigh more and make more money. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Emily likes to buy processed chickens. (B) Emily likes to sell processed chickens.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Emily likes to sell processed chickens.\nExplanation: If Emily is the one selling the chickens, it would make sense for her to prefer frozen chickens as they have a longer shelf life and can be sold for a higher price. This would result in more profit for Emily, hence the statement that frozen chickens make more money. On the other hand, if Emily was the one buying the chickens, her preference for processed chickens would not necessarily result in them weighing more or making more money."}}
{"Q": "Jack has been working for railroads for many years. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is familiar with all special procedures. (B) Jack's company mainly uses nanotechnology.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Since Jack has been working for railroads for many years, it is likely that he has gained experience and knowledge about the industry, including special procedures. It is not mentioned in the statement that his company mainly uses nanotechnology, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The propeller is working. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Only then did the machine gears start to turn. (B) The metal shaft is spinning.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The metal shaft is spinning.\nExplanation: Since the propeller is connected to the metal shaft, it would cause the shaft to spin as well. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A does not necessarily follow as the propeller could be working independently of the machine gears."}}
{"Q": "He went to learn to skate today. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's knowledge has greatly expanded. (B) He skated for hours on the rink.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He skated for hours on the rink.\nExplanation: Since the sentence states that he went to learn to skate, it is more plausible that he spent time practicing and skating on the rink rather than just gaining knowledge about skating. Therefore, option B is a more likely result of his activity."}}
{"Q": "There is a report about the daily life of the president. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor diagnosed him as hypertension. (B) The president has a reasonable schedule, regular exercise and a substantial schedule of work.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the report would highlight the president's healthy habits and well-structured daily routine rather than diagnosing him with a medical condition. A reasonable schedule, regular exercise, and a substantial workload are all positive indicators of a healthy lifestyle."}}
{"Q": "Tom found a adhesive with top viscosity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The engine has broken. (B) Susan's cell phone is very hot after use.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The engine has broken.\nExplanation: The viscosity of an adhesive is not related to the temperature of a cell phone. It is more likely that the cause of the adhesive's high viscosity is due to a problem with the engine, such as a malfunctioning pump or a clogged filter. These issues can cause the adhesive to become thicker and more difficult to work with."}}
{"Q": "The man has commited sins such as robbery. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He should take some colchicine. (B) He gets paralysis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He gets paralysis.\nExplanation: Committing sins such as robbery does not have a direct medical treatment like taking colchicine. However, it can have consequences such as legal punishment or societal rejection. In this case, the consequence mentioned is paralysis, which could be a metaphorical punishment or a result of physical injury during the robbery."}}
{"Q": "She sent them into different strange families. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Twins resemble Lucy. (B) Lucy gave birth to twins but couldn't afford the living of them.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Lucy gave birth to twins but couldn't afford to raise them. This is a common reason for parents to give up their children for adoption or send them to live with other families. The fact that the families are described as \"strange\" suggests that Lucy may not have had many options or resources to choose from. The fact that the twins resemble Lucy (option A) is not mentioned in the text and is therefore not a valid explanation."}}
{"Q": "Cathy wears special clothing to protect herslef. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Poor comfort of sackcloth leads to reduced demand. (B) Cathy likes to keep bees in her spare time.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Cathy wears special clothing to protect herself suggests that she is likely keeping bees in her spare time. Beekeepers wear protective clothing to prevent bee stings, which can be painful and even dangerous for those who are allergic. Option A, which suggests that poor comfort of sackcloth leads to reduced demand, is not relevant to the given information and is therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "They have found urethanes and carbonic acid. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists wants to explore something related to carbamic acid. (B) Scientists have done a research about the oxidizers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The presence of urethanes and carbonic acid suggests that scientists have conducted research on oxidizers, as these compounds can be formed as a result of oxidation reactions. Urethanes can be formed by the reaction of isocyanates with alcohols, while carbonic acid can be formed by the reaction of carbon dioxide with water. Both of these reactions can occur in the presence of oxidizing agents, such as ozone or hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, it is more plausible that scientists have studied oxidizers rather than exploring something related to carbamic acid."}}
{"Q": "John wants to know how chromatids appear. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He took use of stoichimetry. (B) The teacher asked him to observe the anaphase of spindle fibers division.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Chromatids appear during the anaphase of spindle fibers division, when the sister chromatids separate and move towards opposite poles of the cell. Therefore, observing the anaphase of spindle fibers division would be a more plausible way for John to learn about how chromatids appear. Stoichiometry, on the other hand, is a branch of chemistry that deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions, and is not directly related to the appearance of chromatids."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes geology and biological. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He chooses to study paleontology. (B) He enjoys the scientific art of describing living things.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He chooses to study paleontology.\nExplanation: Paleontology is a field that combines both geology and biology, as it involves the study of fossils and the history of life on Earth. Tom's interests in both geology and biology make paleontology a logical choice for him to pursue. While option B is also a possibility, it is a more general statement and does not necessarily reflect a specific career or academic path."}}
{"Q": "The crab caught the fisherman's hand by its pincers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The little boy suffers from roseola. (B) The fisherman stopped the movement of the crab.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The fisherman stopped the movement of the crab.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the crab caught the fisherman's hand by its pincers. The cause of this was that the fisherman stopped the movement of the crab, which could have provoked the crab to defend itself by using its pincers. Option (A) about the little boy suffering from roseola is irrelevant and has no connection to the given sentence. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tensiometers failed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Even a little mass could destroy the nerve system. (B) Air bubbles developed in the water column.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Air bubbles developed in the water column is a more plausible answer as it is a common cause of tensiometer failure. Air bubbles can disrupt the flow of water in the column, leading to inaccurate readings. This can happen due to improper installation, damage to the equipment, or other factors. On the other hand, option A seems less likely as even a little mass is unlikely to destroy the nerve system of a tensiometer."}}
{"Q": "There are hammerheads in the aquarium. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) No antibody will be produced to resist Creatine. (B) They consume a lot of sweets every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. No antibody will be produced to resist Creatine.\nExplanation: The presence of hammerheads in the aquarium is not related to their consumption of sweets. However, hammerheads are known carriers of a virus that can infect other fish in the aquarium. This virus can suppress the immune system of the infected fish, making it unable to produce antibodies to resist Creatine. Therefore, the presence of hammerheads in the aquarium can lead to a lack of resistance to Creatine in other fish."}}
{"Q": "He sold his artifacts for a large of money. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John bought some ephemerals. (B) He was in need of money.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He was in need of money.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that he sold his artifacts for a large amount of money, indicating that he needed money. Option A, which suggests that John bought some ephemerals, is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the given information in the sentence. Therefore, option B is the more logical answer."}}
{"Q": "The valves of the heart closed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The heart relaxed. (B) The heart contracted.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) The heart relaxed.\nExplanation: When the heart relaxes, the pressure inside the heart chambers decreases, causing the valves to close and prevent the backflow of blood. This is known as diastole, the phase of the cardiac cycle when the heart is filling with blood. In contrast, during systole, the heart contracts and pumps blood out of the chambers, which requires the valves to open and allow blood to flow through. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer than option (B) in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "I have a sweet tooth and feel dizzy sometimes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My doctor wants me to be tested for diabetes. (B) I had cancer sometimes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Feeling dizzy and having a sweet tooth are both symptoms of diabetes. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor would want to test for diabetes rather than cancer. It is important to get tested and receive proper treatment if diagnosed with diabetes."}}
{"Q": "Tom has observed that there some leaves attaching to the trunk. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He recognized that it is a plam. (B) He was upset about the falling leaves.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He recognized that it is a palm.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom observed leaves attaching to the trunk suggests that he was able to identify the type of tree or plant he was looking at. Palm trees are known for having leaves that attach directly to the trunk, so it is likely that Tom recognized this characteristic and identified the plant as a palm. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Tom was upset about the falling leaves, which is not necessarily implied by the observation of leaves attaching to the trunk."}}
{"Q": "Tom's heart beat faster because of smoking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor injected Tom with amiodarone. (B) Tom was banned from smoking by his wife.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom was banned from smoking by his wife.\nExplanation: Smoking can cause an increase in heart rate and other negative health effects. It is plausible that Tom's wife, concerned about his health, would ban him from smoking as a result of his increased heart rate. It is less likely that a doctor would immediately inject Tom with medication without first exploring other options or discussing the risks and benefits with him."}}
{"Q": "The soldier was thinking how to kill the dragon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He excluded the usage of dynamite. (B) He excluded the usage of posion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He excluded the usage of dynamite.\nExplanation: Since the soldier was thinking about how to kill the dragon, it is likely that he was considering different methods of attack. By excluding the usage of dynamite, it suggests that he may have thought about using explosives as a potential option but ultimately decided against it. This could be due to concerns about collateral damage or the dragon's ability to withstand explosions. On the other hand, there is no information in the sentence to suggest that the soldier considered using poison, so it is less likely to be the result of his thoughts."}}
{"Q": "Fleas bite me today. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I catch a fever. (B) I got a shower today.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) I got a shower today.\nExplanation: Fleas are commonly found in carpets, bedding, and furniture. They can easily jump onto a person's skin and bite them. Taking a shower can disturb the fleas and cause them to jump onto the person's skin, resulting in bites. Catching a fever is not related to flea bites."}}
{"Q": "He was resettled in Russia. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack doesn't want to go back to his country. (B) Jack's country is at war.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Jack's country is at war.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack was resettled in Russia due to the conflict or war in his home country, which made it unsafe for him to stay there. This is a common reason for resettlement, as individuals may face persecution, violence, or other forms of harm in their home country. On the other hand, there is no indication in the given information that Jack doesn't want to go back to his country, so option (A) is less likely."}}
{"Q": "Tom stores some apple juice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to made some cider. (B) Tom is in charge of the snack supply.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom is in charge of the snack supply.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because storing apple juice would be a logical choice for someone in charge of providing snacks for others. It is a common beverage choice and can be easily stored for later use. Making cider would require additional steps and equipment, making it less likely to be the cause of Tom's actions."}}
{"Q": "Historians studied the characteristics of human society in various eras. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They did not find any similarities between different eras. (B) They found that the enactment of law was an essential cornerstone of social development.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They found that the enactment of law was an essential cornerstone of social development.\n\nExplanation: Historians have found that the enactment of law has been a crucial factor in the development of human society throughout history. Laws have helped to establish order, resolve conflicts, and protect the rights of individuals and groups. While there are certainly differences between different eras and societies, the importance of law as a tool for social development is a common thread that runs through many different historical contexts. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John gave us a formal presentation of his idea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) More people in us were attracted by it. (B) His personal insights amazed the audience.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. More people in us were attracted by it.\nExplanation: When someone gives a formal presentation of their idea, the purpose is usually to persuade others to support or invest in it. Therefore, it is more likely that the result of John's presentation would be that more people were attracted to his idea, rather than just being amazed by his personal insights. While his insights may have been impressive, the ultimate goal of the presentation was to gain support for his idea."}}
{"Q": "The Cockroaches infected Tom. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) All the seedlings in his garden were eaten by them. (B) Tom might have salmonella.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom might have salmonella.\nExplanation: Cockroaches are known to carry bacteria such as salmonella, which can cause food poisoning in humans. If Tom was infected by the cockroaches, it is possible that he could have contracted salmonella and become ill. The statement about the seedlings being eaten by the cockroaches is not necessarily related to Tom's infection and is therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "She often gets nosebleeds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna puts objects with artificial scent in the corner of her room. (B) Linda likes to rub her nostrils with her fingers.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Linda likes to rub her nostrils with her fingers.\nExplanation: Nosebleeds can be caused by various factors such as dry air, allergies, infections, and nose picking. Option B suggests that Linda has a habit of rubbing her nostrils with her fingers, which can cause irritation and damage to the delicate blood vessels in the nose, leading to nosebleeds. Option A, on the other hand, mentions the use of objects with artificial scent, which may cause allergies or irritation but is less likely to be the sole cause of frequent nosebleeds."}}
{"Q": "The man will have a baptism next week. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He will make a public confession in the presence of others. (B) Tom is suffering from heat stroke.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He will make a public confession in the presence of others.\nExplanation: Baptism is a religious ceremony where a person publicly declares their faith and commitment to a particular religion. As a part of the ceremony, the person undergoing baptism usually makes a public confession of their faith in the presence of others. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B is not related to the given statement and is an irrelevant choice."}}
{"Q": "His body is filled with protein. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom eats an egg every day. (B) Tom always takes into some food which includes chitin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom eats an egg every day.\nExplanation: Eggs are a good source of protein, and consuming them regularly can increase the protein content in the body. Chitin, on the other hand, is a complex carbohydrate found in the exoskeletons of arthropods and is not a significant source of protein. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lucy is suffering from depression. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor gave her some protriptyline. (B) The doctor put her on a ventilato.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor gave her some protriptyline.\nExplanation: Depression is a mental health condition that can be treated with medication, therapy, or a combination of both. Protriptyline is a type of antidepressant medication that can help alleviate symptoms of depression. A ventilator, on the other hand, is a medical device used to assist with breathing and is not typically used to treat depression. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It was stained easily. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I poured some alcohol on the polyester by accident. (B) I poured some oil on the polyester by accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Polyester is a synthetic fabric that is known for its resistance to stains and wrinkles. However, it can be easily stained by oil-based substances such as cooking oil, grease, and motor oil. This is because polyester is a hydrophobic material, meaning it repels water-based liquids but absorbs oil-based liquids. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the staining was due to accidentally pouring oil on the polyester rather than alcohol."}}
{"Q": "His computer was infected with a virus. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boy was immersed in the internet. (B) Tom opened an attachment to an unknown email.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Opening an attachment from an unknown email is a common way for viruses to infect a computer. It is important to be cautious when opening emails and attachments from unknown sources to avoid potential harm to your computer. While being immersed in the internet can increase the risk of encountering viruses, it is not necessarily the direct cause of a virus infecting a computer."}}
{"Q": "A plant grows towards the light throughout the life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Phototropism indicates growth towards the light. (B) Phototropism indicates growth against the light.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Phototropism indicates growth towards the light.\nExplanation: Phototropism is a plant's response to light, where it grows towards the light source. This is due to the plant hormone auxin, which accumulates on the shaded side of the plant and causes elongation of cells, resulting in bending towards the light. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it explains the phenomenon of phototropism and how it causes plants to grow towards the light."}}
{"Q": "Bossed took care of them immediately. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There were some uncontrollable conditions here. (B) Mom's restaurant lack turkeys.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Mom's restaurant lack turkeys.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because if the restaurant lacked turkeys, it would have affected the business and the customers. Bossed, being a responsible boss, would have taken care of the situation immediately to ensure that the customers were satisfied and the business was not affected. On the other hand, option (A) is too vague and does not provide any specific reason for Bossed's immediate action."}}
{"Q": "These carrier particles were close to each other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Strong interactions occur between gluons. (B) Solutes chromatographically interacted with the micelles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\n\nExplanation: The statement mentions \"carrier particles,\" which are likely referring to gluons, the carrier particles of the strong nuclear force. Gluons are known to interact strongly with each other, which would explain why they are close to each other in this scenario. Option B, which mentions solutes and micelles, is not relevant to the context of carrier particles and strong interactions."}}
{"Q": "Pheasants are going through the brooding stage. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom keeps pheasants in the winter. (B) Tom keeps pheasants in the summer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom keeps pheasants in the summer.\nExplanation: Pheasants typically go through the brooding stage during the spring and summer months when they are raising their young. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom keeps pheasants in the summer, rather than in the winter, which is not the typical breeding season for these birds."}}
{"Q": "The biologist present a picture of Hominoids. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The scholar examined it carefully. (B) The audience saw they have no tails.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The audience saw they have no tails.\nExplanation: Hominoids are a group of primates that includes humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans, among others. One of the defining characteristics of hominoids is that they lack tails, which distinguishes them from other primates. Therefore, when the biologist presented a picture of hominoids, it is likely that the audience noticed this characteristic and realized that they have no tails. It is less likely that the scholar examined it carefully, as this would depend on the context and purpose of the presentation."}}
{"Q": "It releases radiation when at work. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The microwave has complex circuits. (B) Electrons,protons and neutrons are the key constituents of material.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Electrons, protons, and neutrons are the key constituents of material, and when they interact with each other, they can release radiation. This is likely the cause of the radiation being released when the microwave is at work. Complex circuits may also contribute to the release of radiation, but the interaction of particles is a more fundamental cause."}}
{"Q": "The result is in an attenuation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The intensity of the electricity lost. (B) The element in the F region refers to the element whose electrons with the highest energy arranged in the F orbit.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The intensity of the electricity lost.\n\nExplanation: Attenuation refers to the reduction in the strength of a signal as it travels through a medium. In this case, the result being in an attenuation suggests that the signal (likely an electrical signal) has lost intensity or strength as it traveled through the medium. The element in the F region, as described in choice B, is not relevant to the concept of attenuation and therefore is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The most advanced group of prosimians in relation to the higher primates controlled this forest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are many animals in the forest. (B) Tarsiers are the dominant inhabitants in this forest.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tarsiers are the dominant inhabitants in this forest.\nExplanation: Tarsiers are a group of prosimians known for their advanced sensory abilities, including their large eyes and acute hearing. They are also known for their unique adaptations, such as their ability to rotate their heads 180 degrees and their long hind limbs for leaping. These adaptations give them an advantage in their forest habitat, allowing them to hunt for insects and avoid predators more effectively than other prosimians. Therefore, it is likely that the presence of tarsiers in this forest contributed to their group being the most advanced in relation to higher primates."}}
{"Q": "Most bonsai just begin their growth cycle. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Spring comes. (B) When it comes to winter, trees begin to shrink.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Spring comes.\nExplanation: Bonsai trees, like most plants, follow a seasonal growth cycle. As the weather warms up and the days get longer in spring, bonsai trees begin to come out of their dormant state and start to grow new leaves and branches. This is why the most plausible answer is A, as winter is a time when trees typically go into a dormant state and do not actively grow."}}
{"Q": "He ate another snake. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cottonmouth is hungry. (B) This dodo was hungry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The cottonmouth is hungry.\nExplanation: Cottonmouths are known to be opportunistic feeders and will eat a variety of prey, including other snakes. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cottonmouth ate another snake because it was hungry and saw the snake as a potential meal. On the other hand, the idea of a dodo eating a snake is highly unlikely as dodos were herbivores and did not have the physical adaptations to hunt or consume meat."}}
{"Q": "Mike got a firefly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He observed lots of jelly-like material in it. (B) Mike fed it with some small insects.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Mike fed it with some small insects.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mike would take care of the firefly by feeding it with small insects rather than observing jelly-like material in it. Fireflies are insects that require food to survive, and feeding it with small insects would be a more logical action for someone who wants to take care of it."}}
{"Q": "The Middle East is short of fresh water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Some countries go to war because of fresh water. (B) Her more severe depression, rather than mine needs a doctor.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Some countries go to war because of fresh water.\nExplanation: The scarcity of fresh water in the Middle East has led to tensions and conflicts between countries over access to water resources. For example, the Nile River is a major source of water for Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia, and there have been disputes over the construction of dams and water usage. Similarly, the Jordan River is a vital water source for Israel, Jordan, and Palestine, and there have been conflicts over water rights and allocation. These disputes have the potential to escalate into armed conflicts, making fresh water scarcity a serious issue in the region."}}
{"Q": "Asthma developing late in life doesn't have postive skin tests. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He or she tends to be allergic. (B) He or she tends to be nonallergic.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He or she tends to be nonallergic.\nExplanation: Late-onset asthma is often associated with non-allergic triggers such as respiratory infections, irritants, and stress. In these cases, skin tests for allergies may be negative, indicating that the asthma is not caused by an allergic reaction. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has a better awareness than Tom when doing work. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She is proved to have a high level of spiritual awareness. (B) Lucy was more successful than Tom.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Lucy was more successful than Tom.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that Lucy's better awareness helped her in doing work, which implies that she was able to perform better than Tom. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy was more successful than Tom rather than being proved to have a high level of spiritual awareness."}}
{"Q": "This region is of great density. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It has production from local rivers. (B) It has production from local people.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. It has production from local people.\nExplanation: A region of great density typically means that there are a lot of people living in that area. Therefore, it is more plausible that the production in the region comes from the local people rather than local rivers. The high population density could lead to increased economic activity, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and trade, which would contribute to the production in the region."}}
{"Q": "The polka dotted ski under his fur of that part was revealed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cat was shaved on his back. (B) The criminal pressed his fingers on the spot.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The cat was shaved on his back.\nExplanation: If the polka dotted ski under the fur was revealed, it is likely that the fur was shaved off in that area, revealing the skin underneath. Option B, that a criminal pressed their fingers on the spot, does not make sense in this context and is not a plausible explanation."}}
{"Q": "His life is often disturbed by herds or terrible weather. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack's grandfather was a rancher. (B) Tom lives on a prairie.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom lives on a prairie.\nExplanation: Herds and terrible weather are common occurrences on prairies, which are vast grasslands with few trees and little rainfall. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's life is often disturbed by these factors because he lives on a prairie rather than because of his grandfather's occupation as a rancher."}}
{"Q": "He wanted to eat some nuts to ingest folic acid. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought some hazelnuts. (B) His mom bought sundews for him.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He bought some hazelnuts.\nExplanation: Hazelnuts are a good source of folic acid, so it would make sense for him to buy them to ingest folic acid. Sundews, on the other hand, are carnivorous plants and not a source of folic acid. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He bought packs of cigarettes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My dad knew his cancer. (B) The boy was under great stress.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The boy was under great stress.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the boy bought packs of cigarettes, which is often a coping mechanism for people who are under stress. It does not mention anything about the father's cancer, so option (A) is not a plausible answer. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely cause of the boy's behavior."}}
{"Q": "She has got the first prize in the Olympics. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This cat can swim in the sea. (B) Liu Xuan has a strong ability to keep balance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Liu Xuan has a strong ability to keep balance.\nExplanation: The question is asking for the cause of Liu Xuan winning the first prize in the Olympics. Option (B) is a more plausible answer as it highlights Liu Xuan's specific skill of maintaining balance, which is crucial in gymnastics, the sport in which she won the prize. Option (A) is irrelevant to the question and does not provide a logical explanation for her success in the Olympics."}}
{"Q": "The bears hid in fear. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mangabeys took over the forest. (B) A group of people came to the zoo to watch the bears.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mangabeys took over the forest.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible as it suggests a natural threat to the bears' habitat, which would cause them to hide in fear. On the other hand, the presence of people in a zoo would not necessarily cause fear in bears, as they are accustomed to human presence."}}
{"Q": "They found that chaperones bound to protein. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Biologists use experiments to get proteins into the matrix. (B) He wanted to find infectious proteins without genes of their own.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Biologists often use chaperones to help fold and stabilize proteins during experiments. Therefore, it is likely that the chaperones were intentionally added to the protein samples in order to aid in their proper folding and prevent aggregation. This is a common technique used in protein purification and analysis. Option B is not relevant to the given information and does not explain the binding of chaperones to proteins."}}
{"Q": "It is of liitle use when a car accident really happens. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Remeber to wear a helmet when riding your motocar. (B) Cars have windshields.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Wearing a helmet is not relevant to car accidents as it is a safety measure for motorcycle riders. The more plausible answer is to drive safely and follow traffic rules to prevent car accidents."}}
{"Q": "Eric said this building has a majestic appearance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The number of basophils in this poor girl is outside the bounds of normality. (B) Eric carefully checked the properties of this building.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Eric's careful examination of the properties of the building likely revealed its impressive architectural design, which led him to describe it as having a majestic appearance. Choice A is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for the building's appearance."}}
{"Q": "The reported results were mainly involved the childhood stages. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The occurrence of Roseola has been investigated. (B) Susan found many participants for her research.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The occurrence of Roseola has been investigated.\nExplanation: The question states that the reported results were mainly involved in childhood stages. This suggests that the research focused on a specific childhood illness or condition. Choice A, which suggests that the occurrence of Roseola was investigated, is a more plausible answer as Roseola is a common childhood illness that typically affects children under the age of 2. It is possible that the research aimed to investigate the prevalence, symptoms, and outcomes of Roseola in children. Choice B, which suggests that Susan found many participants for her research, does not explain why the reported results were mainly focused on childhood stages."}}
{"Q": "This is her lifestyles. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jessy only eats vegetables. (B) Emily eats a very healthy diet.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Emily's healthy diet is the cause of her lifestyle, rather than Jessy only eating vegetables. A healthy diet can lead to a healthier lifestyle overall, including better physical and mental health, more energy, and a longer lifespan. While eating vegetables is certainly a part of a healthy diet, it is not the only factor. Therefore, option B is a more likely cause of Emily's lifestyle."}}
{"Q": "Mark took some drugs known as mucolytics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The mucus in his lungs was decomposed. (B) His limbic system was activated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The mucus in his lungs was decomposed.\nExplanation: Mucolytics are drugs that help break down and thin out mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up and clear out. Therefore, it is more plausible that the drugs caused the decomposition of mucus in Mark's lungs rather than activating his limbic system, which is responsible for emotions and motivation."}}
{"Q": "John fed the Sculpins with their fish food and herring eggbeds. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Instinct leads him to a normal protein. (B) The Sculpins ate both kinds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The Sculpins ate both kinds.\nExplanation: Since John fed the Sculpins with both fish food and herring eggbeds, it is more plausible that the Sculpins ate both kinds of food rather than John's instinct leading him to a normal protein. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "He drank too much recently and his pancreas got inflammed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack has to take haemodialysis due to his kidney cancer. (B) He is diagnosed with pancreatitis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the person's pancreas got inflamed, which is a symptom of pancreatitis. Drinking too much alcohol is a common cause of pancreatitis. Option A is not related to the given statement and is therefore an unlikely cause."}}
{"Q": "Tom was elected as a sheriff. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was reponsible for his own department. (B) The angel gave him a hand.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was responsible for his own department.\nExplanation: When someone is elected as a sheriff, they are given the responsibility of leading and managing their own department of law enforcement. This includes overseeing the work of deputies, maintaining public safety, and enforcing the law in their jurisdiction. Option B, about an angel giving him a hand, is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the duties and responsibilities of a sheriff."}}
{"Q": "They bought lots of mental. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They wanted to make bars. (B) They wanted to make leather.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) They wanted to make bars.\nExplanation: The word \"mental\" is likely a misspelling of \"metal,\" which is a common material used in the production of bars. On the other hand, leather is not typically associated with the use of metal, making option (B) less plausible."}}
{"Q": "She is pregnant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her husband is very happy. (B) He needs to use ultrasound to detect the condition of the fetus.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: When a woman is pregnant, it is necessary to monitor the condition of the fetus through ultrasound. While it is possible that her husband may be happy about the pregnancy, it is not a guaranteed result and therefore not a more plausible answer than the need for ultrasound."}}
{"Q": "Bananas give off a sweet smell. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The weather has been fine recently. (B) The bananas jack bought were overripe.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Bananas give off a sweet smell when they are overripe. The process of ripening causes the starch in the fruit to break down into sugar, which produces a sweet aroma. Therefore, it is more plausible that the bananas Jack bought were overripe, rather than the weather being the cause of the sweet smell."}}
{"Q": "The students pointed directly to the moons. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Geography teacher uses a globe to teach students about geography. (B) The professor asked the students to find natural satellites.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The professor asked the students to find natural satellites.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the students pointed directly to the moons, which implies that they were looking for something specific. Option B is the most plausible answer as it suggests that the professor asked the students to find natural satellites, which could include moons. Option A, on the other hand, is not relevant to the sentence as it talks about a geography teacher using a globe to teach students about geography, which has no connection to the students pointing to the moons."}}
{"Q": "Human race has evoluted a little bit. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There is a big sun in the sky. (B) To adapt to new environment, the human gene pool has undergone some changes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the human gene pool has undergone some changes to adapt to new environments. This is supported by scientific evidence that shows how genetic mutations and natural selection have played a significant role in the evolution of humans over time. As humans migrated to different parts of the world, they faced different environmental challenges, such as changes in climate, food sources, and disease. Those who were better adapted to these challenges were more likely to survive and pass on their genes to future generations, leading to the evolution of the human species."}}
{"Q": "Crabs can find food by their instinct. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Human beings need nutritious food for their survival. (B) Using chemical stimuli is one of the aminal's instincts.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Using chemical stimuli is one of the animal's instincts.\nExplanation: Crabs, like many other animals, have the ability to detect and respond to chemical stimuli in their environment. This is a natural instinct that helps them find food, avoid predators, and navigate their surroundings. While human beings also need nutritious food for survival, this is not directly related to the ability of crabs to find food through their instinctual response to chemical stimuli. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This guy believes in spiritualism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He lost the spiritual spark in his life. (B) This guy got religion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: This guy got more involved in spiritual practices and beliefs.\nExplanation: Believing in spiritualism often leads to a deeper exploration of spiritual practices and beliefs. It is unlikely that someone who believes in spiritualism would lose the spiritual spark in their life, as that is the very essence of their belief system. While it is possible that someone who believes in spiritualism may also become more religious, it is not necessarily a given and depends on the individual's personal beliefs and experiences."}}
{"Q": "The results showed a range of symptoms from insomnia to death among them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The biologist came to the iceland. (B) The subjects were given steroids.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The subjects were given steroids.\nExplanation: Steroids are known to have a range of side effects, including insomnia, mood swings, and even death in extreme cases. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the symptoms observed in the subjects was due to the steroids they were given rather than the arrival of a biologist in Iceland."}}
{"Q": "Tom suffered from  gastrointestinal illnesses. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The food  made Tom choke at his spiracle. (B) The food Tom ate contained bacteria.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The food Tom ate contained bacteria.\nExplanation: Gastrointestinal illnesses are often caused by consuming food or water that is contaminated with harmful bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Choking at the spiracle would not cause gastrointestinal illnesses. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He can't stop his hiccups. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has something wrong with his muscles controlling the diaphragm. (B) Tim cannot secrete saliva.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He has something wrong with his muscles controlling the diaphragm.\n\nExplanation: Hiccups are caused by involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle, which separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity and plays a crucial role in breathing. If there is something wrong with the muscles controlling the diaphragm, it can lead to persistent hiccups. On the other hand, the inability to secrete saliva (choice B) is not directly related to hiccups. While dry mouth can be a symptom of certain medical conditions, it is not a common cause of hiccups."}}
{"Q": "Tom has to overcome all the barriers in front of him. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He finds that each barrier is more difficult than the former one. (B) He finds that all the barriers are the same.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He finds that each barrier is more difficult than the former one.\n\nExplanation: It is common for obstacles to become more challenging as one progresses towards their goal. This is because the initial barriers may be easier to overcome, but as one moves forward, they may encounter more complex and difficult challenges. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom finds each barrier more difficult than the previous one."}}
{"Q": "Researchers found that lampreys lay eggs in the same way as salmon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists want to find the animal with the largest eye among mammals relative to their body weight. (B) Researchers study the spawning habits of lampreys.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The question states that researchers found that lampreys lay eggs in the same way as salmon. This suggests that the researchers were studying the spawning habits of lampreys, which is the topic of choice (B). Choice (A) is unrelated to the topic of lamprey spawning habits and is therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "The doctor's interpretation involved the affected functions of his lungs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack laid in a coffin. (B) The CT images of Tom's lungs showed Fibrosis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The CT images of Tom's lungs showed Fibrosis.\nExplanation: Fibrosis is a condition where there is scarring and thickening of the lung tissue, which can lead to a decrease in lung function. This is a more plausible cause for the affected lung functions mentioned in the question, compared to the unlikely scenario of Jack laying in a coffin."}}
{"Q": "The winter was freezing cold. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Martens all survived the winter in special ways. (B) Martens will die in the cold weather.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Martens all survived the winter in special ways.\nExplanation: Martens are adapted to survive in cold weather, and they have various strategies to cope with freezing temperatures. For example, they have thick fur coats that keep them warm, and they can also slow down their metabolism to conserve energy. Therefore, it is more likely that they would survive the winter in special ways rather than all dying in the cold weather."}}
{"Q": "I saw baby turtles this evening. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I saw pregnant turtles three days ago. (B) The government and families guarantee children's right to receive education.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Seeing baby turtles is most likely the result of pregnant turtles laying eggs and the eggs hatching. It is common for turtles to lay eggs in the sand or soil near bodies of water, and the eggs can take several weeks to hatch. Therefore, it is more plausible that the sighting of baby turtles is due to the previous presence of pregnant turtles laying eggs. The second choice about education rights is not related to the sighting of baby turtles."}}
{"Q": "The doctor asked him to do some examinations. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom felt something wrong with his body and went to hospital. (B) Stephen went to the hospital.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The sentence states that the doctor asked him to do some examinations, implying that Tom was already at the hospital and had reported feeling something wrong with his body. Option B is not relevant to the given information. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They are crawlers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are some flowers. (B) There are some small insects.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) There are some small insects.\nExplanation: Crawlers are typically small insects that move around on their legs or by crawling. Therefore, it is more plausible that the presence of small insects caused the observation of crawlers rather than the presence of flowers."}}
{"Q": "This shows that he has a strong ability of viability. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The vet has injected some oxytocins into the dog's body. (B) The fetus has a strong ability to survive independently of the woman's body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the dog's fetus has a strong ability to survive independently of the mother's body. This could be due to various factors such as genetic makeup, proper development of organs, and a healthy placenta. It is unlikely that the vet injected oxytocins into the dog's body as oxytocin is a hormone that stimulates uterine contractions and is usually given to induce labor or manage postpartum bleeding."}}
{"Q": "He always keeps a healthy body and hardly suffers a disease. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack often goes to the gym. (B) Tom always takes into some food which includes chitin.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jack often goes to the gym.\nExplanation: Regular exercise is known to boost the immune system and improve overall health, reducing the risk of many diseases. Going to the gym regularly is a good way to maintain a healthy body and prevent illnesses. On the other hand, chitin is a fibrous substance found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects, and while it has some health benefits, it is unlikely to be the sole reason for someone's good health and low susceptibility to disease."}}
{"Q": "He can teach his own child. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has talents in English. (B) This land is his homestead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"he can teach his own child,\" implying that he has the ability to do so. The reason for this ability is given as \"Tom has talents in English,\" suggesting that he is proficient in the language and therefore capable of teaching it to his child. The fact that the land is his homestead is not relevant to his ability to teach his child."}}
{"Q": "Too many tasks were assigned to the worker of strong ability. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He worked hard to manage the balance. (B) He reached his limitations and broke down.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He reached his limitations and broke down.\nExplanation: Even though the worker had strong ability, assigning too many tasks can lead to burnout and stress. It is not always possible to manage the balance, and eventually, the worker may reach their limitations and break down. This is a common issue in workplaces, and it is important to assign tasks based on the worker's capacity and workload."}}
{"Q": "The cameraman praised the perfect position of her body parts in relation to each other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The model had a perfect posture. (B) The weather is good for spring outing today.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The model had a perfect posture.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions the position of the model's body parts in relation to each other, which indicates that the cameraman was referring to the alignment and balance of her body. This is typically achieved through good posture, which involves maintaining the natural curves of the spine and keeping the shoulders, hips, and feet in proper alignment. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide a logical explanation for the cameraman's comment."}}
{"Q": "All his skeletal muscles in his body contracted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom felt nervous. (B) He took opium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He took opium.\nExplanation: Opium is a narcotic drug that can cause muscle contractions or spasms. This is a known side effect of opium use. On the other hand, feeling nervous may cause some muscle tension, but it is unlikely to cause all the skeletal muscles in the body to contract simultaneously. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "These albums comfort him when he felt lonely. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is an officer. (B) He kept those albums.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He kept those albums.\nExplanation: The cause of Tom's comfort when feeling lonely is likely due to the fact that he kept those albums. Music can have a powerful effect on our emotions and can provide comfort and solace during difficult times. By keeping these albums, Tom likely had a source of familiar and comforting music that he could turn to whenever he needed it. As a result, the music may have helped him feel less alone and provided a sense of connection and comfort."}}
{"Q": "He was very good at raising animals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack's grandfather was a rancher. (B) Mario is keen on doing experiments according to instructions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jack's grandfather was a rancher.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Jack's skills in raising animals were passed down from his grandfather who was a rancher, rather than Mario's interest in following instructions for experiments. The fact that Jack has a family member with experience in animal husbandry suggests that he may have learned from his grandfather and gained practical knowledge and skills through hands-on experience. On the other hand, Mario's interest in following instructions for experiments may not necessarily translate to skills in animal husbandry."}}
{"Q": "His wife found an internal flaw in the diamond. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary held a funeral for her recently deceased husband last week. (B) Mr. Smith bought a diamond for his wife.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Mr. Smith bought a diamond for his wife.\nExplanation: The internal flaw in the diamond is most likely due to a natural occurrence during the diamond's formation process. It is not related to Mary holding a funeral for her deceased husband. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The intestine makes adaptations, such as the enlarged sacculated parts of the colon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments. (B) Food is digested in the body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \n\nExplanation: The enlargement and sacculated parts of the colon are adaptations that allow for more efficient absorption of water and nutrients from digested food. As food moves through the colon, water is absorbed and the feces become more solid. The sacculated parts of the colon increase the surface area for absorption, allowing for more efficient nutrient and water uptake. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not related to the adaptation of the intestine."}}
{"Q": "This city became famous for tourism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lots of tourists begin their trips. (B) Soon it achieved significant growth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Soon it achieved significant growth.\nExplanation: When a city becomes famous for tourism, it attracts a large number of visitors. This, in turn, leads to an increase in demand for various services such as accommodation, transportation, food, and entertainment. As a result, the city experiences significant growth in terms of its economy, infrastructure, and overall development. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He had been studying where calcification occurs. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found that most of it was in the wrong tissues with accelerated calcification of arteries. (B) The doctor pronounced him dead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He found that most of it was in the wrong tissues with accelerated calcification of arteries.\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person was studying calcification, which is the accumulation of calcium in body tissues. The result of his study was that he found that most of the calcification was occurring in the wrong tissues, which could refer to tissues where calcification is not normal or desirable, such as the arteries. The phrase \"accelerated calcification of arteries\" supports this interpretation. Option B, which suggests that the person died, is not a plausible answer based on the information given in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "It caught a small fish below the surface. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The trout scrounged for food. (B) The caimen was hungry.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The trout scrounged for food.\nExplanation: Trout are known to feed on small fish and insects below the surface of the water. It is a common behavior for them to scrounge for food in this manner. On the other hand, caimans are not known to feed on small fish in this way, as they typically hunt larger prey such as fish, birds, and mammals. Therefore, it is more plausible that the small fish was caught by the trout rather than the caiman."}}
{"Q": "He can use the knowledge guided by love to help others. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is such a man of generosity. (B) Bob is wise.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Bob is wise.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Bob has knowledge guided by love, which implies that he is wise and has a deep understanding of how to use his knowledge to help others. Option A, that he is a man of generosity, does not necessarily explain why he has the ability to use his knowledge to help others. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I changed my yard to a garden. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My house lacks collections of plants. (B) Tom planted some broccoli seeds in his yard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The lack of plant collections in the house suggests that the person may have wanted to add more greenery to their surroundings. This could have led them to convert their yard into a garden. On the other hand, the fact that Tom planted broccoli seeds in his yard does not necessarily mean that the person changed their yard to a garden."}}
{"Q": "It can can change into viscosity quickly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This sol is thixotropic. (B) The building has weak plasticity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. This sol is thixotropic.\n\nExplanation: Thixotropy is the property of certain gels or fluids that become less viscous when they are stirred or shaken and then return to their original viscosity after being left to stand. Therefore, if a sol is thixotropic, it can change into viscosity quickly due to external forces such as stirring or shaking. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which refers to the building's plasticity and is not directly related to the sol's viscosity."}}
{"Q": "The chemistry teacher used some polymers for experiments. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He took use of some amines. (B) The experiment produced a lot of smoke.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The experiment produced a lot of smoke.\nExplanation: Polymers are large molecules made up of repeating units. When subjected to heat or other chemical reactions, they can break down and produce smoke. Therefore, it is more plausible that the use of polymers in the experiment resulted in the production of smoke rather than the use of amines."}}
{"Q": "The circulating fatty acid in his body is beyond limitation now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom drank five cups of coffee last night. (B) Tom drank five bottles of beer last night.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom drank five bottles of beer last night.\nExplanation: Alcohol consumption can lead to an increase in circulating fatty acids in the body. This is because alcohol is metabolized in the liver, which can lead to an increase in the production of fatty acids. In addition, alcohol can also impair the body's ability to metabolize and utilize fatty acids, leading to an accumulation in the bloodstream. While coffee consumption can also have some effects on fatty acid metabolism, it is unlikely to cause a significant increase beyond limitation."}}
{"Q": "Lysosomes have less acidic property than the cytosol. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The food thrown into the forest contained with mycotoxins. (B) A higher ph indicates less acidic property.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\n\nExplanation: Lysosomes are organelles that contain hydrolytic enzymes and have an acidic pH of around 4.5. This acidic environment is necessary for the enzymes to function properly. However, compared to the cytosol, which has a neutral pH of around 7.2, lysosomes have a less acidic property. This is because the lysosomal membrane contains proton pumps that actively transport protons (H+) into the lysosome, lowering its pH. In contrast, the cytosol does not have such proton pumps, and its pH is maintained by other mechanisms. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it explains the difference in pH between lysosomes and the cytosol. Option A is not relevant to the question and does not provide a logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "Tom needs to study Banach Tarski paradox. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is proficient in mathematical logic operations. (B) Tom is a math teacher.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom is studying the Banach Tarski paradox because he is a math teacher. The Banach Tarski paradox is a complex mathematical concept that is not commonly studied by individuals who are not involved in the field of mathematics. As a math teacher, Tom may be interested in exploring this paradox to gain a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and to be able to explain it to his students."}}
{"Q": "Tom caught a cold. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a virus spreading in the air of Tom's class. (B) Tom came out of the greenhouse in a T-shirt in winter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. There was a virus spreading in the air of Tom's class.\nExplanation: Catching a cold is often caused by a viral infection, and it is more likely that Tom caught the cold from a virus spreading in the air of his class rather than coming out of a greenhouse in a T-shirt in winter. While being exposed to cold temperatures can weaken the immune system and make someone more susceptible to catching a cold, it is not the direct cause of the illness. On the other hand, being in close proximity to others who are infected with a cold virus can easily spread the illness through the air."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have detected up to 26 species. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Geneticists detect the number of blood types in a canine population. (B) Scientists have tested the number of coat color types in a canine population.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Scientists have tested the number of coat color types in a canine population. This is a more plausible answer because the number of species in a population is not determined by blood types, but rather by genetic and physical characteristics. Coat color is a visible and easily identifiable trait that can vary greatly between different species of canines. Therefore, it is more likely that scientists would detect multiple species based on coat color variations rather than blood type variations."}}
{"Q": "The muscles in her pelvic area became relaxed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The woman was pregnant. (B) The doctor gave Susan relaxin during childbirth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The doctor gave Susan relaxin during childbirth.\nExplanation: Relaxin is a hormone that is naturally produced by the female body during pregnancy and childbirth. It helps to relax the muscles and ligaments in the pelvic area, allowing for easier delivery of the baby. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor gave Susan relaxin during childbirth to help her muscles relax, rather than her being pregnant."}}
{"Q": "She accidentally shut the botfly in the refrigerator. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After two hours, she found the botfly frozen to death. (B) He could only found some sleeping.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He could only found some sleeping.\n\nExplanation: Botflies are tropical insects and cannot survive in cold temperatures. However, it is unlikely that the botfly would freeze to death in just two hours in a typical household refrigerator. It is more plausible that the botfly became sluggish or dormant due to the cold temperature, but would still be alive and able to fly once it warmed up again. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "The pilot found spruces with same height. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The helicopter passed a forest of spruces. (B) Mario and Mary have totally converse arguments about the same issue.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the pilot found spruces with the same height suggests that they were likely part of a forest or group of trees that were planted or grew under similar conditions, such as soil type, sunlight exposure, and water availability. This is a more plausible explanation than option B, which is unrelated to the topic and does not provide any explanation for the observation."}}
{"Q": "John was studying the structure of the dendrite. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found that the structure of the dendrite was like a house. (B) He found out the structure like a tree.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He found out the structure like a tree.\n\nExplanation: Dendrites are the branch-like structures that extend from the cell body of a neuron. They receive signals from other neurons and transmit them to the cell body. The structure of dendrites is often compared to that of a tree, with the main dendrite trunk branching out into smaller and smaller branches, just like the trunk of a tree branching out into smaller and smaller branches. Therefore, it is more plausible that John found the structure of the dendrite to be like a tree rather than a house."}}
{"Q": "The meat is moldy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has put the meat in the refrigerator. (B) Tom lost his legs before many years when he happened to a car accident.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom has put the meat in the refrigerator.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the meat being moldy is that it was not stored properly. If Tom had put the meat in the refrigerator, it would have been kept at a low enough temperature to prevent the growth of mold. On the other hand, Tom losing his legs in a car accident many years ago has no direct relation to the meat being moldy."}}
{"Q": "My mother bought me many different vitamins. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I took her to visit crocuses. (B) She thinks my health condition is not very good.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the mother bought the vitamins because she thinks her child's health condition is not very good and wants to improve it. The vitamins are a common way to supplement nutrients that may be lacking in one's diet. Taking the mother to visit crocuses seems unrelated to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Houses are destroyed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Grasshoppers are prevalent in the area. (B) There was a earthquake in the village.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: An earthquake is a more plausible cause for the destruction of houses as it can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. Grasshoppers, while they can cause damage to crops, are unlikely to cause widespread destruction of houses."}}
{"Q": "Women learn that they all miscarry at different times. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Different women chat about miscarry together. (B) Lily is pregnant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Miscarriage can occur due to various reasons such as genetic abnormalities, hormonal imbalances, infections, or structural problems in the uterus. As each woman's body and pregnancy are unique, the timing and cause of miscarriage can differ. Therefore, it is more plausible that women learn about their miscarriages at different times through conversations with other women who have experienced it, rather than a single person's pregnancy affecting others."}}
{"Q": "Their society was damaged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The two women had harsh Amputation. (B) The people in this modern time didn't follow the culture.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the damaged society is more likely to be the people not following their culture in modern times. Harsh amputation of the two women may have been a contributing factor, but it is not enough to cause widespread damage to an entire society. On the other hand, if people do not follow their cultural norms and values, it can lead to a breakdown of social order and cohesion, which can have far-reaching consequences for the entire community."}}
{"Q": "Tom and Lucy were arranged to different positions. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have different responsibilities. (B) They have made different achievements.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They have different responsibilities.\nExplanation: Since Tom and Lucy were arranged to different positions, it is likely that they were given different roles and tasks to perform. This would result in them having different responsibilities, as they would be working on different aspects of the job. It is not necessary that they have made different achievements, as their success would depend on how well they perform their respective roles. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The two generals are enermies. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They interacted on the battlefield. (B) They slept on the battlefield.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They interacted on the battlefield.\nExplanation: If the two generals are enemies, it is more likely that they would interact on the battlefield, where they are leading their respective armies against each other. It is unlikely that they would sleep on the battlefield together, as they would be in close proximity to each other and it would be dangerous for them to let their guard down."}}
{"Q": "The irish druid saw ravens. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He used these birds of omen for augury. (B) His limbic system was activated.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He used these birds of omen for augury.\nExplanation: In Celtic mythology, ravens were considered to be birds of omen and were often associated with the god of prophecy and wisdom, Bran. Therefore, it is more plausible that the Irish druid would use these birds for augury, rather than his limbic system being activated."}}
{"Q": "The student was asked to classify those living things. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had to design the necessary components. (B) The student adopted the method of taxonomy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The student adopted the method of taxonomy.\nExplanation: When asked to classify living things, the most appropriate method to use is taxonomy, which is the science of naming, describing, and classifying organisms based on their characteristics and evolutionary relationships. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student adopted this method rather than designing the necessary components, which is not related to the task of classifying living things."}}
{"Q": "Then the inside of the evaporator will become moldy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The air condition evaporator will get moisture on the surface when refrigeration. (B) The evaporator is abandoned for years.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The air condition evaporator will get moisture on the surface when refrigeration. This moisture can create a damp environment that is conducive to mold growth. If the evaporator is not properly cleaned and maintained, mold can begin to grow on its surface. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B is less likely as it implies that the evaporator has been abandoned for years, which is not a common scenario in regular maintenance of air conditioning systems."}}
{"Q": "She built a hut. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna wants to take pictures with a camera. (B) She needed a shelter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) She needed a shelter.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for someone to build a hut is to have a shelter. It is a basic human need to have a safe and secure place to live in, especially in harsh weather conditions. Option (A) about taking pictures with a camera does not seem to be a logical reason for building a hut."}}
{"Q": "We slept in a cave last night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We found many crustaceans in the cave. (B) The gems as a kind of mineral are mainly used for decoration and collection because of its brilliant appearance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. We found many crustaceans in the cave.\nExplanation: It is more likely that sleeping in a cave would result in discovering new things in the cave, such as crustaceans, rather than learning about the uses of gems. The sentence only mentions sleeping in the cave, so it is reasonable to assume that any consequences would be related to the cave itself."}}
{"Q": "He kept a pot of flowers at home. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Because there was no sunshine, the flowers withered. (B) The flowers withered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) Because there was no sunshine, the flowers withered.\n\nExplanation: Plants need sunlight to carry out photosynthesis, which is the process of converting light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth. Without sunlight, the flowers would not be able to produce enough energy to sustain themselves, and they would eventually wither and die. Therefore, it is more plausible that the flowers withered due to the lack of sunshine."}}
{"Q": "After using it she felt better. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The girl used her intuition to diagnose herself. (B) The doctor gave her some plaster.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The doctor gave her some plaster.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the girl used some kind of treatment that made her feel better. Option B states that the doctor gave her some plaster, which could have been a treatment for a physical injury or ailment. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that the girl diagnosed herself using intuition, which is less likely to be a reliable source of medical treatment. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The surrounding animals have mutated. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Signals of high frequency were transmitted to tuataras. (B) The laboratory accidentally leaked radioactive materials containing curium.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The laboratory accidentally leaked radioactive materials containing curium.\nExplanation: Radioactive materials can cause mutations in living organisms, including animals. Curium is a highly radioactive element that can cause genetic mutations and other harmful effects. If the laboratory accidentally leaked curium, it could have contaminated the surrounding environment and caused the animals to mutate. While high-frequency signals can also have effects on living organisms, it is less likely to cause mutations in animals. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He uses some ice to induce vasoconstriction. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His legs are swelling out. (B) Tom wants to protect his ankles when he runs.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His legs are swelling out.\nExplanation: Vasoconstriction is the narrowing of blood vessels, which reduces blood flow and can help reduce swelling. Therefore, it is more plausible that the use of ice to induce vasoconstriction is to address swelling in the legs rather than to protect the ankles during running."}}
{"Q": "Researchers extracted lovage's components. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They found it on a thinner, heavier crust. (B) A volatile oil angelic acid a bitter extractive resins was found.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. A volatile oil angelic acid a bitter extractive resins was found.\n\nExplanation: When researchers extracted lovage's components, they found a volatile oil containing angelic acid, as well as bitter extractive resins. This is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the extraction process and the components found in lovage. Option A, on the other hand, seems unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "Atmospheres are not as healthy as before anymore. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These gases pollute the towns and cities. (B) There hasn't been substantial rainfall in this region for a long period.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the atmosphere is not as healthy as before, which implies that there has been a change in the quality of air. Option A states that gases pollute the towns and cities, which is a more plausible reason for the decline in air quality. On the other hand, option B talks about a lack of rainfall, which may affect the environment in other ways but is not directly related to the quality of the atmosphere. Therefore, option A is a more likely cause of the problem."}}
{"Q": "Typhoons frequently occur in coastal areas. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The rainy season is here. (B) The weather is hot in summer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Typhoons are caused by the combination of warm ocean water and low-pressure systems. Coastal areas are more prone to typhoons because they are closer to the ocean where the warm water is located. The rainy season is typically when typhoons occur because it is when there is more moisture in the air and more low-pressure systems are formed. The weather being hot in summer does not directly cause typhoons."}}
{"Q": "They would fully focus on the process of carrying out medical experiments. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Pharmacists are cautious about the proportion of medical materials. (B) Positive emotions can heal people's inner heart.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Pharmacists are responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical experiments, which requires careful attention to the proportion of medical materials used. Therefore, it is plausible that they would fully focus on the process of carrying out medical experiments to ensure that the correct proportions are used and that the experiments are conducted safely and effectively. On the other hand, positive emotions may be important for overall well-being, but they are not directly related to the process of carrying out medical experiments."}}
{"Q": "John's office with a macrozamia got fire. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is nothing wrong with the macrozamia. (B) The ground around it was also damaged.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The ground around it was also damaged.\nExplanation: When a fire occurs, it can cause damage to the surrounding area. In this case, since John's office with the macrozamia got fire, it is likely that the ground around it was also damaged. The heat from the fire could have caused the soil to become dry and compacted, which could affect the growth of the macrozamia. Additionally, the fire could have caused damage to the roots of the plant, which could also impact its health. Therefore, it is more plausible that the ground around the macrozamia was also damaged as a result of the fire."}}
{"Q": "The clear gels cooled my face. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I placed part of aloes on my face. (B) I placed part of chili on my face.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I placed part of aloes on my face.\nExplanation: Aloe vera gel is known for its cooling and soothing properties, making it a popular ingredient in skincare products. When applied to the skin, it can help to reduce inflammation and redness, as well as provide a cooling sensation. Chili, on the other hand, is a spicy ingredient that can cause a burning sensation on the skin, rather than a cooling one. Therefore, it is more likely that the clear gels cooled the face because they contained aloe vera, rather than chili."}}
{"Q": "My father was diagnosed with atherosclerosis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We knew it started to growed since many years ago. (B) He went to hospital to treat the long bones.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) He went to hospital to treat the long bones.\nExplanation: Atherosclerosis is a condition where plaque builds up inside the arteries, which can lead to blockages and reduced blood flow to various organs. It is not directly related to the long bones, so option (A) is not a plausible answer. However, if the reduced blood flow caused by atherosclerosis led to a bone fracture or other bone-related issue, it is possible that the person may need to go to the hospital to receive treatment for their bones. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Poverty is equally distributed in that country. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This country embraces capitalism. (B) This country forged a unique model of communism.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. This country forged a unique model of communism.\nExplanation: In a communist system, the government owns and controls all resources and wealth, and aims to distribute them equally among the population. Therefore, it is more plausible that a country with equally distributed poverty would have a communist system in place, rather than a capitalist one where wealth and resources are often concentrated in the hands of a few. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of communism in achieving equal distribution of wealth has been debated and varies depending on the specific implementation and context."}}
{"Q": "Sam walked in the mist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam's shirt got wet. (B) The rough surface of the turbulent water covered his upper body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sam's shirt got wet.\nExplanation: Walking in mist typically results in getting wet, as mist is essentially tiny droplets of water suspended in the air. It is unlikely that the rough surface of turbulent water would cover Sam's upper body unless he was walking in a body of water, which is not specified in the given sentence. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This patient has schizophrenia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He regards himself as a stigma. (B) She committed suicide.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He regards himself as a stigma.\nExplanation: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that can cause individuals to experience delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking. Unfortunately, there is still a significant amount of stigma surrounding mental illness, including schizophrenia. As a result, individuals with schizophrenia may internalize this stigma and view themselves as flawed or inferior. This can lead to feelings of shame, low self-esteem, and social isolation. While suicide is a risk for individuals with schizophrenia, it is not necessarily a direct result of the diagnosis itself."}}
{"Q": "The keepers put them in contact with each other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Spring is the season for animals to reproduct. (B) The animals have been neutered.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Spring is the season for animals to reproduce.\nExplanation: Spring is the breeding season for many animals, as the weather becomes warmer and food becomes more abundant. Therefore, it is likely that the keepers put the animals in contact with each other during this time to encourage breeding and reproduction. Option B, stating that the animals have been neutered, would not be a reason for putting them in contact with each other as neutered animals cannot reproduce."}}
{"Q": "She had difficulties for the first time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy just started to feed doves. (B) Amy was good at feeding doves.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Amy just started to feed doves.\nExplanation: It is likely that Amy had difficulties for the first time because she was new to feeding doves and had not yet developed the necessary skills or experience. Option B suggests that Amy was already good at feeding doves, which would make it less likely for her to have difficulties for the first time. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack found that much of the heart is myocardium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack observed the heart of a mouse in the laboratory. (B) John's tonsils got inflamed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Jack most likely observed the heart of a mouse in the laboratory and found that much of the heart is myocardium. Myocardium is the muscular tissue of the heart, and it is a well-known fact in the field of biology. John's tonsils getting inflamed has no relation to the observation made by Jack."}}
{"Q": "Tom has done many chemical experiments. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researchers extracted several different components. (B) He took use of the result to stick two pieces of paper together.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Tom has done many chemical experiments, which implies that he has been working with different substances and trying to extract or combine them in various ways. Therefore, it is more plausible that the researchers (presumably working with Tom or analyzing his results) were able to extract several different components from his experiments, rather than him using the results to stick two pieces of paper together, which seems like a very simple and unrelated outcome."}}
{"Q": "He is prone to lung disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor advised him to eat more elderberries. (B) The doctor told him to have more intake.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: None of the choices are plausible.\n\nExplanation: Neither of the options provided address the issue of lung disease. Eating elderberries may have some health benefits, but it is not a recommended treatment for lung disease. Similarly, simply increasing intake without specifying what to increase intake of would not be helpful in treating lung disease. It is important to seek medical advice and treatment from a qualified healthcare professional for any medical condition."}}
{"Q": "The father has commited adultery. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The relationships within his family broke. (B) I trust his discrimination.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The relationships within his family broke.\nExplanation: Adultery is a breach of trust and can cause significant emotional pain and damage to a family. It can lead to feelings of betrayal, anger, and resentment, which can ultimately break down relationships within the family. While it is possible for the family to work through the issue and rebuild their relationships, it is likely that there will be significant challenges and changes that need to be made in order to do so. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "People dare not to go near Jack's home. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This malicious activity was held by mavens. (B) Jack keeps a lot of bulls near his home.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that Jack keeps a lot of bulls near his home, which could be dangerous for people to approach. This is a more logical explanation than the first choice, which mentions malicious activity by mavens, but does not provide any context or explanation for what that activity might be. Bulls, on the other hand, are known to be aggressive and territorial animals, and it would make sense for people to avoid an area where they are kept."}}
{"Q": "There is something wrong with his lower bowel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor found he had diverticulosis. (B) He was diagnosed with acute appendicitis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The doctor found he had diverticulosis.\nExplanation: Diverticulosis is a condition where small pouches or sacs form in the wall of the colon. It can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. If someone has something wrong with their lower bowel, diverticulosis is a more likely diagnosis than acute appendicitis, which is a condition where the appendix becomes inflamed and requires immediate surgery. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom witnessed the process of Plateletpheresis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He thought it was similar to donating blood except for a few dangers. (B) He thought it was similar to donating blood except for a few exceptions.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: Plateletpheresis is a process of collecting platelets from a donor's blood through a machine that separates the platelets and returns the rest of the blood components back to the donor. It is similar to donating blood, but the process takes longer, and the donor's blood is returned to their body. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom thought it was similar to donating blood except for a few exceptions, rather than dangers."}}
{"Q": "A lot of small particles appeare after the teacher writes on the blackboard. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has got a schematic from his teacher. (B) Jack observes the chalk in the teacher's hand.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jack observes the chalk in the teacher's hand.\n\nExplanation: When the teacher writes on the blackboard with chalk, small particles of chalk dust are released into the air. This is a common occurrence and is the most likely cause of the small particles appearing after the teacher writes on the blackboard. Tom having a schematic from his teacher is not related to the appearance of small particles, so option A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He has a furnace at home. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He observes its movement during daytime. (B) He uses the boiler to heat the food.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that he uses the furnace to heat his home or water rather than observing its movement during the day. Using the boiler to heat food is not a common practice and is unlikely to be the result of having a furnace at home."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought a hummingbird on his way home. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hummingbird lives in a healthy way. (B) He cleans its plumages every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The hummingbird lives in a healthy way.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's purchase of a hummingbird resulted in the bird living in a healthy way, as he may have provided it with proper food, shelter, and care. It is not necessarily implied that he cleans its plumages every day, as this would be a specific and potentially time-consuming task that may not be feasible for everyone who owns a hummingbird."}}
{"Q": "The giraffe was killed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The lion hunted the giraffe. (B) Two bearcats were raised in the zoo.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The lion hunted the giraffe.\nExplanation: Lions are natural predators of giraffes and are known to hunt them for food. On the other hand, bearcats are not known to hunt giraffes and are not typically found in the same habitat as giraffes. Therefore, it is more plausible that the giraffe was killed by a lion rather than bearcats."}}
{"Q": "I cooked Fucus vesiculosus for my father. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His thyroid function was promoted for more intake of iodine. (B) He washed it in boil oil.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. His thyroid function was promoted for more intake of iodine.\nExplanation: Fucus vesiculosus, also known as bladderwrack, is a type of seaweed that is rich in iodine. Iodine is an essential nutrient for the thyroid gland, which regulates metabolism in the body. Consuming Fucus vesiculosus can help promote thyroid function by providing the body with more iodine. Therefore, it is more plausible that the consumption of Fucus vesiculosus would promote thyroid function rather than washing it in boil oil."}}
{"Q": "Tom wished to cross that canal. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His company gave him a hand. (B) Tom hired a boat and sailed across the canal.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom hired a boat and sailed across the canal.\nExplanation: Since the sentence only mentions Tom's wish to cross the canal, it is more plausible that he took action himself and hired a boat to cross the canal rather than his company giving him a hand. Therefore, option B is a more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "The helpless cub closes its eyes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It's the first week of the cub after birth. (B) The cub is a month old.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the helpless cub is closing its eyes because it is in its first week after birth. Newborn cubs often keep their eyes closed during their first week of life as they are still adjusting to their new environment and developing their senses. A one-month-old cub would likely have its eyes open and be more active."}}
{"Q": "He added starch to the bowl of water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A precipitate soon formed on the fronts. (B) Soon the water was boiling.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A precipitate soon formed on the fronts.\nExplanation: When starch is added to water, it forms a suspension. Over time, the starch particles will settle to the bottom of the bowl, forming a precipitate. This is a common occurrence when a solid is added to a liquid and is a more plausible outcome than the water boiling, which would require a significant increase in temperature."}}
{"Q": "The professors of the Science Park adjusted the polarization. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The state of the atmosphere is very bad recently. (B) Professors study animals and plants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The state of the atmosphere is very bad recently.\nExplanation: Adjusting polarization is a technique used to improve the quality of images obtained through microscopes. The state of the atmosphere can affect the quality of images obtained, especially in cases where there is a lot of atmospheric distortion. Therefore, it is more plausible that the professors adjusted the polarization due to the bad state of the atmosphere, rather than studying animals and plants, which is not directly related to the use of polarization in microscopy."}}
{"Q": "Single-celled creature consumes food differently from multi-cellular creature. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) But paramecium is an exception. (B) Squirrels need to prepare food for several weeks in advance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Single-celled creatures, such as paramecium, consume food through a process called phagocytosis, where they engulf food particles with their cell membrane and form a food vacuole. Multi-cellular creatures, on the other hand, have specialized organs and systems for digestion and absorption of nutrients. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it acknowledges the exception of paramecium and the difference in food consumption between single-celled and multi-cellular creatures. Option B is not relevant to the question and does not provide a logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "He became happier than before. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was sad and he listend to the music. (B) Mr. White saw a bird in the sky.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom was sad and he listened to the music, which made him happier than before. Music has been known to have a positive effect on mood and can help alleviate feelings of sadness or depression. On the other hand, seeing a bird in the sky may be a pleasant experience, but it is unlikely to have a significant impact on one's overall happiness."}}
{"Q": "He was forced to pay taxed and fined. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Poor John doesn't want to pay taxes. (B) The millionaire put a price tag on the valueless leave.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that he was forced to pay taxes and fined, but it doesn't give any indication that it was because he didn't want to pay taxes. The second option, that a millionaire put a price tag on a valueless leaf, seems unrelated to the sentence. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that there was some legitimate reason for him to pay taxes and fines, possibly related to his income or business activities."}}
{"Q": "My mom keeps cleaning in my room. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I keep sneezing. (B) It is  a cockroach-infested apartment.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. I keep sneezing.\nExplanation: If your mom keeps cleaning in your room, it is likely that she is using cleaning products that may contain chemicals or dust that can trigger allergies or cause irritation in your respiratory system. This can result in sneezing, coughing, or other allergic reactions. On the other hand, option B is less likely unless there is a serious infestation problem in the apartment."}}
{"Q": "The farmer measured the hardness of a wheat kernel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found it has a high percentage of salts. (B) The PSI he got was 5.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The PSI he got was 5.\nExplanation: PSI stands for \"pounds per square inch\" and is a measure of the hardness of a material. In this case, the farmer measured the hardness of a wheat kernel and got a PSI reading of 5. This information could be useful in determining the quality of the wheat and its suitability for various uses, such as milling into flour or feeding to livestock. Option A, which suggests a high percentage of salts, is not directly related to the measurement of hardness and is therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a new pilot. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has to attend flight schools. (B) He can't enjoy his life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He has to attend flight schools.\nExplanation: As a new pilot, Tom would need to attend flight schools to gain the necessary knowledge and skills to safely operate an aircraft. This is a standard requirement for anyone who wants to become a pilot, regardless of their personal enjoyment of life. Attending flight schools is a necessary step towards achieving his goal of becoming a pilot."}}
{"Q": "Many helpers came to aid the flood hit area. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Among them are children, adults and old men. (B) Situations of this area got much better.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that many helpers came to aid the flood-hit area, which implies that they provided assistance and support to the affected people. Therefore, it is more plausible that the situation of the area got much better as a result of the aid provided by the helpers. Option A is irrelevant to the statement and does not provide any information about the outcome of the helpers' aid."}}
{"Q": "He saw ants on the petals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom picked up some eucalyptus blossom. (B) This boy had hyperactivity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom picked up some eucalyptus blossom.\nExplanation: Ants are attracted to sweet nectar and often crawl on flowers to collect it. Eucalyptus blossoms are known to produce sweet nectar, so it is likely that the ants were attracted to the petals because Tom had picked up some eucalyptus blossom. On the other hand, hyperactivity in a boy would not be a plausible cause for ants being on the petals."}}
{"Q": "The environment is clean. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is a good place for canaries to live. (B) The vegetation grows well.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The vegetation grows well.\nExplanation: A clean environment is conducive to the growth of vegetation as it provides the necessary nutrients and conditions for plants to thrive. Canaries may also benefit from a clean environment, but it is more likely that the vegetation would be the first to show improvement."}}
{"Q": "There is a male pig and a female big in the pigpen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has gained a lot of profits. (B) They have a small pig baby.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They have a small pig baby.\nExplanation: It is biologically possible for a male and female pig to mate and produce offspring. Therefore, the most plausible outcome of having a male and female pig in the same pen is that they would reproduce and have a piglet. Option A, that the owner gained profits, is not necessarily true and depends on the purpose of keeping the pigs."}}
{"Q": "The farmer picked the ripen melon up. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Farmers want to buy some strychnine. (B) The tendril nearest the watermelon turned brow.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The tendril nearest the watermelon turned brown.\nExplanation: When a watermelon is ripe, the tendril nearest to it turns brown and dries up. This is a natural indicator that the fruit is ready to be picked. Therefore, it is more plausible that the farmer picked the melon because the tendril had turned brown, rather than because they wanted to buy some strychnine."}}
{"Q": "These abalones were too small to be sold. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mother usually cooks whelks for him. (B) They were kept for reproducing baby abalones.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They were kept for reproducing baby abalones.\nExplanation: When abalones are too small to be sold, they are often kept for breeding purposes. This allows the abalone farmer to produce more abalones for future sales. Therefore, it is more plausible that the small abalones were kept for reproducing baby abalones rather than the unrelated fact that the protagonist's mother usually cooks whelks for him."}}
{"Q": "Kings seek addresses. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An address stresses one's presence. (B) There was a murder case in this area.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Kings seek addresses because an address stresses one's presence. In the past, it was important for kings to know the location of their subjects and their level of wealth and status. Addresses were a way to keep track of the population and to assert the king's authority over his kingdom. Knowing the addresses of his subjects also allowed the king to send messages, summon them for military service, or collect taxes. Therefore, the cause of kings seeking addresses was mainly to maintain control and governance over their kingdom."}}
{"Q": "Tom begins his puberty. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His adulthood ends. (B) His childhood ends.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) His childhood ends.\nExplanation: Puberty is a natural process of physical and hormonal changes that occur in the body during adolescence. It marks the transition from childhood to adulthood. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's childhood ends as he enters puberty, rather than his adulthood ending."}}
{"Q": "He sang into the microphone. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sound waves are converted to electrical voltages. (B) Sound waves are converted to electrical resistance.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Sound waves are converted to electrical voltages.\nExplanation: When someone sings into a microphone, the sound waves from their voice are picked up by the microphone's diaphragm, which converts the sound waves into electrical signals or voltages. These electrical signals are then sent through a cable to an amplifier, which boosts the signal and sends it to speakers or recording equipment. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, is not accurate as electrical resistance is a property of materials that opposes the flow of electrical current, and it is not directly related to the conversion of sound waves into electrical signals."}}
{"Q": "First only his head was hot, now his whole body is hot. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Zachary has been bothered by migraine pain for hours. (B) Tom got a fever.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: If only the head is hot, it could be a symptom of a migraine. However, if the whole body is hot, it is more likely to be a fever. Fevers can cause the body to feel hot and can be accompanied by other symptoms such as chills, sweating, and body aches. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Anurans are hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They will have a physiological reaction when they meet the prey. (B) Anurans begin to hate drinking water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They will have a physiological reaction when they meet the prey.\nExplanation: When anurans are hungry, their bodies will release hormones and enzymes that prepare them for hunting and consuming prey. This physiological reaction includes increased heart rate, respiration, and metabolic activity, as well as heightened senses and motor coordination. It is a natural response to hunger and helps anurans to be more successful in finding and catching food. On the other hand, there is no logical reason why hunger would cause anurans to hate drinking water, as water is essential for their survival and hydration."}}
{"Q": "The willow sapling died. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The little moose was alone beside the street. (B) Tom forgot to water the willow saplings.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom forgot to water the willow saplings.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the willow sapling's death is lack of water, as willow trees require a lot of moisture to thrive. Choice A, the presence of a little moose, is unrelated and does not explain the death of the sapling."}}
{"Q": "John wanted to raise a semi-hardy perennial. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His company gave him a hand. (B) He raised buttercups.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He raised buttercups.\nExplanation: The question states that John wanted to raise a semi-hardy perennial, which refers to a plant that can survive in colder temperatures but may need some protection during harsh winters. Buttercups are a type of semi-hardy perennial, so it is more plausible that John was successful in raising them rather than his company giving him a hand, which is not related to the question."}}
{"Q": "Mary had good results in recent practice tests. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her skating speed on the ice has increased significantly. (B) She got satisfactory results in the formal test.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. She got satisfactory results in the formal test.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Mary had good results in recent practice tests. This implies that she was able to perform well and improve her skills during the practice tests. As a result, it is more likely that she would get satisfactory results in the formal test, rather than her skating speed increasing significantly. The sentence does not provide any information about her skating speed, so option A is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Jenny's breasts are stunted. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She used Pasteurization to kill them. (B) Doctors diagnosed low estrogen levels in her body.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Doctors diagnosed low estrogen levels in her body.\nExplanation: Stunted breast growth can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal imbalances. Low levels of estrogen, a hormone that plays a key role in breast development, can result in underdeveloped breasts. Pasteurization, on the other hand, is a process used to kill harmful bacteria in food and has no relation to breast growth. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They all died prematurely. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Those creepers were not provided with any diet here. (B) Many of his pet birds were malnourished.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Many of his pet birds were malnourished.\nExplanation: Malnourishment can lead to weakened immune systems and other health problems, which can ultimately result in premature death. The fact that \"many\" of the pet birds were malnourished suggests that this was a widespread issue and likely contributed to the premature deaths of all the animals mentioned. In contrast, choice A only mentions \"those creepers\" and does not provide enough information to suggest that lack of diet was the sole cause of death for all the animals."}}
{"Q": "Tom came into contact with a rhinovirus patient. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom made sure that the patient was fine. (B) Tom got bronchitis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom got bronchitis.\nExplanation: Rhinovirus is a common cause of the common cold, and it can also lead to other respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom would have contracted bronchitis rather than simply ensuring that the patient was fine."}}
{"Q": "Many beautiful facets appeared which makes the diamond more shining. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John polished the diamond perfectly. (B) Lucy loves her dog.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John polished the diamond perfectly.\nExplanation: The appearance of beautiful facets on a diamond is a result of the way it is cut and polished. A skilled diamond cutter can create multiple facets on the surface of the diamond, which reflect light in different directions and create a sparkling effect. Therefore, it is more plausible that the diamond's shine was due to John's perfect polishing rather than Lucy's love for her dog, which has no direct correlation to the diamond's appearance."}}
{"Q": "More and more habitats of wild animals are well protected. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The diversity of animals increased. (B) Most of them live a healthy life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The diversity of animals increased.\nExplanation: When habitats of wild animals are well protected, it means that their natural environment is preserved and their population is allowed to grow. This leads to an increase in the diversity of animals as different species are able to thrive in their natural habitats. Additionally, the protection of habitats also helps to prevent the extinction of endangered species, which further contributes to the increase in diversity. While it is possible that the protection of habitats may also lead to healthier lives for animals, this is not necessarily always the case and cannot be generalized as a result of habitat protection."}}
{"Q": "How well the vessels function can be defined. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have a neutralization reaction. (B) People use reactivity to indicate the vessels function.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: People use reactivity to indicate the vessels function.\nExplanation: Reactivity is a common way to measure the function of vessels, as it can indicate how well the vessel is able to interact with other substances. For example, if a vessel is reactive with certain chemicals, it may be more effective at transporting those chemicals through the body. Therefore, people often use reactivity as an indicator of how well a vessel is functioning. Neutralization reactions, on the other hand, are a specific type of chemical reaction that occur when an acid and a base are combined, and are not necessarily related to vessel function."}}
{"Q": "The god inparted me a divine life changing my nature. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has made a lot of researches in archaeology. (B) I got regeneration.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. I got regeneration.\nExplanation: Regeneration refers to the process of being reborn or renewed, often in a spiritual or religious context. If the god imparted a divine life to the person, it is likely that they experienced some sort of spiritual transformation or renewal, which could be described as regeneration. On the other hand, the fact that the person has made a lot of researches in archaeology is not necessarily related to the divine intervention they experienced. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The third rail is the most busy one. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are three rails in my hometown. (B) The dry season is here.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions \"the third rail\" being the busiest, implying that there are at least three rails. Option A provides a plausible reason for the third rail being the busiest, as it suggests that there are multiple rails in the area. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to rail traffic and does not provide a logical explanation for the statement."}}
{"Q": "Jack watched a soccer game. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack died in a car accident. (B) Jack saw wonderful headshots.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Jack saw wonderful headshots.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack simply enjoyed watching the soccer game and appreciated the skillful headshots made by the players, rather than dying in a car accident as a result of watching the game."}}
{"Q": "She helps residents in the community a lot. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary is a policewomon in that community. (B) Children in the village lack of education.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cause of her helping the residents in the community is due to the lack of education among the children in the village. This could lead to a variety of issues such as poverty, unemployment, and health problems. Mary may be involved in programs or initiatives aimed at improving education and addressing these issues, which would explain her frequent involvement in helping the community. As a police officer, her role may not necessarily involve community outreach and assistance to the same extent as someone focused on education and social welfare."}}
{"Q": "They studied the chemical components of several fruits. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They found both kiwis and papaya have proteine-splitting enzyme. (B) They found  kiwis and papaya have no same components.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They found both kiwis and papaya have proteine-splitting enzyme.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the researchers studied the chemical components of several fruits. The result of their study was that they found that both kiwis and papaya have a proteine-splitting enzyme. This implies that they found a similarity between the two fruits, rather than finding that they have no same components (option B). Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He got a three-dimensional image of the earth. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jerry used tomography when observing the earth. (B) Jerry used map when observing the earth.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Jerry used tomography when observing the earth.\nExplanation: Tomography is a technique used to create a three-dimensional image of an object by taking multiple cross-sectional images. It is commonly used in medical imaging, but can also be applied to other fields such as geology. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jerry used tomography to observe the earth and obtain a three-dimensional image, rather than using a map which only provides a two-dimensional representation of the earth's surface."}}
{"Q": "Jack ate an expired can and went into a coma. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was diagnosed with botulism. (B) He died of the ingestion of cyanide.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was diagnosed with botulism.\nExplanation: Eating expired food can lead to the growth of harmful bacteria, such as Clostridium botulinum, which produces a toxin that can cause botulism. Symptoms of botulism include muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and even coma. Cyanide poisoning is not a likely outcome of eating an expired can."}}
{"Q": "Voldemort is a potential evil mage. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is out of shape. (B) Voldemort became the ultimate villain in the end.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: Voldemort became the ultimate villain in the end.\nExplanation: Voldemort's potential as an evil mage was realized as he became the main antagonist in the Harry Potter series. He was a powerful wizard who sought to dominate the wizarding world and eliminate those who opposed him. His actions led to the deaths of many characters and caused widespread fear and chaos. Therefore, it is more plausible that Voldemort became the ultimate villain in the end rather than being out of shape."}}
{"Q": "She decided to watch the whole movie. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy has waited for Tom for a long time. (B) Lucy doesn't  know why the girl was killed in the trailer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Lucy's decision to watch the whole movie was most likely caused by her curiosity about why the girl was killed in the trailer. This suggests that she was interested in the plot and wanted to find out what happened next, rather than waiting for someone (choice A) which is not mentioned in the given information."}}
{"Q": "The researchers finally chose shellfish. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Only the fishes that reach weight will be selected. (B) This research needs to choose a creature with no head but complex life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) This research needs to choose a creature with no head but complex life.\nExplanation: The researchers chose shellfish because they needed a creature with complex life but no head. This is because the study was focused on understanding how organisms without a centralized nervous system respond to changes in their environment. Shellfish fit this criteria as they have a decentralized nervous system, with nerve cells distributed throughout their bodies instead of being concentrated in a brain. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) is not relevant to the reason why shellfish were chosen for the study."}}
{"Q": "All kinds of white blood cells were damaged to some extent. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Neutrophils known as grapes were damaged. (B) Neutrophils known as granulocytes were damaged.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Neutrophils known as granulocytes were damaged.\n\nExplanation: Granulocytes are a type of white blood cell that includes neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. These cells are responsible for fighting infections and responding to inflammation. If all types of granulocytes were damaged, it would result in a weakened immune response and an increased susceptibility to infections. Neutrophils are the most abundant type of granulocyte, and they are often referred to as \"grapes\" due to their round shape and multiple lobes. However, it is more accurate to refer to them as granulocytes, as this encompasses all types of cells in this category."}}
{"Q": "He was unwilling to go to the dams. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was sick of mud. (B) He wanted to find smail single-celled ocean plants smaller than the size of a pinhead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The fact that he wanted to find small single-celled ocean plants suggests that he had a specific goal or interest in mind, which could be a reason for his unwillingness to go to the dams. On the other hand, the option A, being sick of mud, is not a strong enough reason to avoid going to the dams."}}
{"Q": "Her mother told her that it was rosemaries. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary grabbed a bunch of some kind of plant with foliage and asked what' s it. (B) The old lady likes watching the only annual in the garden.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Mary grabbed a bunch of some kind of plant with foliage and asked what's it. This scenario suggests that Mary was curious about the plant and wanted to know its name. Her mother identified it as rosemaries, which implies that the plant had a distinct appearance that made it recognizable. The other option, that the old lady likes watching the only annual in the garden, does not provide a clear explanation for why Mary's mother identified the plant as rosemaries."}}
{"Q": "He cut the stick with a saw. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to split a wooden stick in two. (B) Tom got a piece of iron stick.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom wants to split a wooden stick in two.\nExplanation: The use of a saw is typically associated with cutting through wood, not iron. Therefore, it is more likely that Tom was trying to split a wooden stick in two and used a saw to do so."}}
{"Q": "This old man died. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He died of lung cancer. (B) His whole life ended.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He died of lung cancer.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the old man died of lung cancer, as this is a common cause of death in older individuals. Option B, stating that his whole life ended, is not a valid answer as it is simply a restatement of the initial statement and does not provide any new information."}}
{"Q": "No matter what their gender is, all people can take any transportation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Everyone is equal. (B) There are many aircrafts at the airport.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Everyone is equal.\nExplanation: This statement suggests that there are no restrictions or limitations on transportation based on gender. This implies that all individuals, regardless of their gender, have equal rights and opportunities to use any mode of transportation. Therefore, the cause of this is the principle of equality, which ensures that everyone is treated fairly and without discrimination."}}
{"Q": "The mice tried to look around for the softest material. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They built nests with the materials they found. (B) They ate the materials they found.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They built nests with the materials they found.\nExplanation: It is common for mice to build nests using soft materials such as cotton, wool, or paper. Therefore, it is more plausible that the mice would use the soft materials they found to build their nests rather than eating them."}}
{"Q": "His legs are entangled in duckweed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Duckweed can become food for fish. (B) Tom was standing in the river and can't move a step.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Tom was standing in the river and can't move a step.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if Tom was standing in the river, it is possible that he could have stepped on or gotten tangled in the duckweed. Duckweed being food for fish does not necessarily explain why Tom's legs are entangled in it."}}
{"Q": "He adores rug making desperately. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom hit the kernels. (B) Mike is crazy about the ancient crafts of Oman.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"he\" adores rug making desperately, but it does not provide any information about who \"he\" is. However, the second choice suggests that Mike is crazy about ancient crafts, which could include rug making. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mike's interest in ancient crafts led him to develop a passion for rug making. Choice A, on the other hand, is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide any explanation for why someone would adore rug making."}}
{"Q": "The ancestors took their descendants to a new habitat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The latter became used to it. (B) They share habitats.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The latter became used to it.\nExplanation: Over time, the descendants would have adapted to the new habitat and developed traits that allowed them to survive and thrive in their new environment. This process is known as natural selection, and it is how species evolve over time. Therefore, it is more plausible that the descendants became used to the new habitat rather than sharing it with their ancestors."}}
{"Q": "There are several kinds of mites living in the chicken coop. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These mites attack poultry. (B) These mites attack kittens and puppies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: Mites are known to be parasitic and can cause harm to their hosts. In this case, since the mites are living in the chicken coop, it is more likely that they will attack poultry rather than kittens and puppies. Poultry mites can cause skin irritation, feather loss, anemia, and even death in severe cases. Therefore, it is important to take measures to control and prevent mite infestations in chicken coops."}}
{"Q": "Susan was accused for plagiarism. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has only attended one contest. (B) Susan used John's intellectual property without permission.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Susan used John's intellectual property without permission.\nExplanation: Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work or ideas without giving them proper credit. In this case, Susan was accused of plagiarism, which means she used someone else's intellectual property without permission. Option (A) about Tom attending only one contest is irrelevant to the accusation of plagiarism. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He often learns about bacteria for his study. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jerry is allergic to pollen. (B) Tom studies Transduction in microrganisms.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B, as it directly relates to the study of microorganisms, which includes bacteria. Allergies to pollen (choice A) do not have a direct connection to the study of bacteria."}}
{"Q": "The little boy collected some paper used in stamp printing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He liked to touch the watermarks on  it. (B) He decided to go to Canada first.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He liked to touch the watermarks on it.\nExplanation: Since the little boy collected paper used in stamp printing, it is likely that the paper had watermarks on it. Watermarks are designs or patterns that are impressed onto paper during the manufacturing process. It is common for collectors to appreciate and enjoy touching the watermarks on paper as it adds to the uniqueness and value of the item. Therefore, it is more plausible that the little boy liked to touch the watermarks on the paper he collected. Option B, on the other hand, seems unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the given information."}}
{"Q": "This insect lives on the cuticle of plants. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It only stays on all the aboveground green parts of plants. (B) They are planted in the backyard.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) It only stays on all the aboveground green parts of plants.\n\nExplanation: Since the insect lives on the cuticle of plants, it is likely that it feeds on the plant's tissues. Therefore, it would make sense for the insect to only stay on the aboveground green parts of plants where it can easily access the plant's tissues. Option (B) is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the insect's behavior or its impact on the plant."}}
{"Q": "His grades will determine whether he can go to university or not. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John's GCSE results will be out soon. (B) He is a student.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. John's GCSE results will be out soon.\nExplanation: The statement clearly states that John's grades will determine whether he can go to university or not. Therefore, the most plausible cause of this is his upcoming GCSE results, which are a crucial factor in determining university admissions. Being a student alone is not a sufficient cause for this particular situation."}}
{"Q": "Those steep slopes are covered with vegetation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) You can see many muskrats burrow there. (B) Earthquakes and floods always take place.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The presence of vegetation on steep slopes indicates that the soil is stable and has not been eroded by natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. Muskrats are known to burrow in stable soil, so it is more plausible that their presence is a result of the stable vegetation-covered slopes."}}
{"Q": "The water level of the stream rises sharply in spring. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It's early spring now. (B) The stream in front of Tom's house almost dried up in winter when there was little precipitation.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: The fact that the stream almost dried up in winter when there was little precipitation suggests that the water level is directly related to the amount of precipitation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the sharp rise in water level in spring is due to increased precipitation during that season. Choice A, stating that it is early spring now, does not provide a clear explanation for the sudden rise in water level."}}
{"Q": "Attention is still under study. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Only people from America were required to give their comments on the issue. (B) Neurological processes haven't been thoroughly studied.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Attention is a complex cognitive process that involves various neurological processes. Despite years of research, there is still much to be understood about how attention works and how it can be improved. Therefore, the cause of attention still being under study is due to the fact that neurological processes haven't been thoroughly studied."}}
{"Q": "We need a machine and sugar cane. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We want to make rum. (B) Our army have requirements for soilders.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Making rum requires a machine to extract the juice from sugar cane, which is then fermented and distilled to produce the final product. Therefore, the need for a machine and sugar cane is more likely to be for making rum rather than for meeting the requirements of an army."}}
{"Q": "Different sizes of embolis are detected in its arteries. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An old monkey is sick with embolis in its brain. (B) Biologists observe the parts of the methyls.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. An old monkey is sick with embolis in its brain.\n\nExplanation: Embolis refers to a blockage in an artery caused by a foreign substance, such as a blood clot or air bubble. The fact that different sizes of embolis are detected in the arteries suggests that there are multiple blockages present. This is a common symptom of a medical condition known as embolism, which can occur in various parts of the body, including the brain. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer as it suggests that an old monkey is sick with embolis in its brain, which could be causing the blockages in the arteries. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the symptoms described and does not provide a plausible explanation for the presence of embolis in the arteries."}}
{"Q": "The shrimp was hunted down by the billfish. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A billfish saw a shrimp in a distance. (B) A billfish smelt a shrimp.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) A billfish smelt a shrimp.\nExplanation: Billfish, like many predatory fish, have a keen sense of smell that they use to locate prey. Shrimp have a distinct odor that can attract billfish from a distance. Therefore, it is more plausible that the billfish hunted down the shrimp because it detected its scent rather than simply seeing it in the distance."}}
{"Q": "A hyena got lost in the forest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was scard and wanted to found its partners. (B) Her sight was harmed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. It was scared and wanted to find its partners.\nExplanation: Hyenas are social animals and live in groups called clans. If a hyena gets lost, it would feel scared and anxious as it is away from its clan. Its natural instinct would be to try and find its way back to its clan and reunite with its partners. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, is not likely as there is no indication that the hyena's sight was harmed."}}
{"Q": "His collegues told him the location of Parsnips. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The closest relatives of parsley in the family Apiaceae was Tom's new interest. (B) Tom was looking for actinoid on the periodic table of elements.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The location of Parsnips was likely told to Tom because his colleagues knew that he had a new interest in the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and parsnips as close relatives. It is unlikely that Tom was looking for actinoid on the periodic table of elements, as this has no connection to parsley or parsnips."}}
{"Q": "Follicles show features of impassability at all stages of development. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Atresia means impassability. (B) Shortly after birth, newborns are exposed to trillions of bacteria.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Atresia means impassability.\nExplanation: Atresia is a medical term used to describe the absence or closure of a natural passage in the body. In the context of follicles, atresia refers to the degeneration and resorption of follicles that do not mature or ovulate. This process can occur at any stage of follicular development and can lead to the formation of cysts. Therefore, the statement that follicles show features of impassability at all stages of development is likely due to the presence of atretic follicles, rather than exposure to bacteria shortly after birth."}}
{"Q": "There was a lot of litter in this water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The pool had serious problem of pollution. (B) Many marine animals died because of this.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The pool had serious problem of pollution.\nExplanation: When there is a lot of litter in the water, it indicates that the water is polluted. This pollution can have various negative impacts on the environment and human health. However, it is unlikely that many marine animals would die because of litter in a pool, as pools are typically not habitats for marine animals. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He exposed the juice to oxygen for a period of time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He feeds it with plants. (B) Vitamin C in the juice is decomposited.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Vitamin C in the juice is decomposited.\nExplanation: When juice is exposed to oxygen for a period of time, the vitamin C in the juice undergoes oxidation and breaks down, leading to a decrease in its nutritional value. This is why it is recommended to consume freshly squeezed juice immediately after preparation to ensure maximum nutrient intake. Feeding the juice with plants is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the process of oxidation."}}
{"Q": "The result showed that it stimulated proliferation of bone cells in vitro. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He studyed how protons were made. (B) He was injected with androgen.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: The cause of the stimulation of bone cell proliferation in vitro was not mentioned in the given choices. Therefore, none of the options is a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Hinds tended to stay away from these areas. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Hinds died in feeding areas provided by humans until winter. (B) Hinds stayed in feeding areas provided by humans until winter.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: The sentence states that Hinds tended to stay away from these areas, implying that they avoided certain areas. Option A suggests that Hinds died in feeding areas provided by humans until winter, which could be a reason for them to avoid those areas. Option B suggests that Hinds stayed in feeding areas provided by humans until winter, which contradicts the statement that they tended to stay away from those areas. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It was severely sunburnt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hippo was locked in a cage under the sun. (B) The kudzu was exposed to the sunlight.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The hippo was locked in a cage under the sun.\nExplanation: Hippos are not adapted to prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, and their skin is sensitive to UV radiation. Therefore, if a hippo is locked in a cage under the sun for an extended period, it is likely to suffer from severe sunburn. On the other hand, kudzu is a plant that is adapted to sunlight and can withstand prolonged exposure without getting sunburnt."}}
{"Q": "He knew much about Ceres. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My father used to be a friar. (B) He studies the largest object in the asteroid belt.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that he studies the largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres. This would explain why he knows much about it. Option A, that his father used to be a friar, does not provide a clear connection to Ceres and seems unrelated."}}
{"Q": "He saw that nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions was taking place. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The experimenter wants to do electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. (B) The chemist combined anhydrides with a variety of nucleophiles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions occur when a nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon of an acyl group, resulting in the substitution of the leaving group. This reaction is commonly observed when anhydrides are combined with a variety of nucleophiles. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it explains the cause of the observed reaction. Option A, on the other hand, is not related to the observed reaction and is an unlikely cause."}}
{"Q": "They made no response. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Signals of low frequency were transmitted to tuataras. (B) Signals of high frequency were transmitted to tuataras.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Signals of high frequency were transmitted to tuataras.\nExplanation: Tuataras are known to have poor hearing and are unable to hear sounds at low frequencies. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lack of response was due to the transmission of signals at high frequencies, which tuataras are also unable to hear."}}
{"Q": "Most of them chose to eat steak. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A group of  men went to a restaurant for dinner. (B) The new guests coming in the famous steakhouse were four blokes.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. A group of men went to a restaurant for dinner.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"most of them\" chose to eat steak, implying that there was a group of people who were given the option to choose what to eat. Option A suggests that a group of men went to a restaurant for dinner, which is a plausible scenario where people would be given the option to choose what to eat. Option B, on the other hand, only mentions four blokes coming into a steakhouse, which does not necessarily imply that they were given the option to choose what to eat. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Some substances reacted with the acid. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The polyphosphates worked on the amino acids. (B) Acid was added to the sample of urine.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: When acid is added to a sample of urine, it can cause a chemical reaction with certain substances present in the urine, leading to their breakdown or precipitation. This is a common method used in urine analysis to test for various conditions and diseases. The polyphosphates working on amino acids is not a likely explanation for substances reacting with acid in urine."}}
{"Q": "It turned out to contain chemicals called cannabinoids. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A chemist examined the chemicals contained in marijuana. (B) Tom put carbon monoxide together with compounds.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the substance contained cannabinoids, which are naturally occurring compounds found in marijuana. Therefore, it is more plausible that a chemist examined the chemicals contained in marijuana rather than someone randomly mixing carbon monoxide with compounds."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a student majoring in the paleoanthropology. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He ,ainly studies about the human evolution. (B) He did a lot of researches about fossil plants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He mainly studies about human evolution.\nExplanation: Paleoanthropology is the study of human evolution and the behavior of early human ancestors. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's studies would focus on human evolution rather than fossil plants, which would fall under the field of paleobotany."}}
{"Q": "Ancestors of dogs and wolves lived in the same circumstances for thousands of years. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Now their offsprings are almost the same. (B) Most of them live a healthy life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Now their offsprings are almost the same.\nExplanation: Dogs and wolves share a common ancestor and have lived in similar environments for thousands of years. As a result, they have evolved to have similar physical and behavioral traits. While there are still some differences between the two species, their offspring (such as wolf-dog hybrids) often exhibit a mix of traits from both parents, making them almost the same in many ways."}}
{"Q": "Kittiwakes are always hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kittiwakes eat amount of food every day. (B) They feed the fish to supplement fat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) They feed the fish to supplement fat.\n\nExplanation: Kittiwakes are seabirds that require a high amount of energy to fly and maintain their body temperature. As a result, they need to consume a lot of food to meet their energy requirements. However, the availability of food in their environment can be unpredictable, which means that they may not always be able to find enough food to sustain themselves. To compensate for this, kittiwakes have developed a unique feeding strategy where they feed on small fish, such as sand eels, and store the excess fat in their bodies. This fat serves as a reserve that they can draw upon during times when food is scarce. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it explains how kittiwakes cope with their constant hunger."}}
{"Q": "His mother made quick bread made with a leavening agent such as baking powder for him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John was very tired after a long day of work. (B) He wanted to eat biscuits.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. He wanted to eat biscuits.\nExplanation: The fact that John's mother made quick bread with a leavening agent such as baking powder suggests that John had a specific craving for biscuits or some other type of bread that required a leavening agent. It is unlikely that his mother would have gone through the trouble of making quick bread if John was simply tired after a long day of work. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The workers of this factory went to the southern hemisphere to look for darker materials. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The factory wanted to mine olivine. (B) Factory hired workers to extract terpenes from evergreen trees.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The factory wanted to mine olivine.\nExplanation: Olivine is a mineral that is commonly found in dark-colored rocks such as basalt. It is used in a variety of industrial applications, including as a refractory material in high-temperature processes. Therefore, it is more plausible that the workers were sent to the southern hemisphere to mine olivine rather than to extract terpenes from evergreen trees, which is not typically a material that would be sourced from that region."}}
{"Q": "Jewelry can make her crazy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary loves things of clarity. (B) Some cuckoos are tired after flying for hours.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mary loves things of clarity.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary's love for jewelry is the cause of her craziness rather than the unrelated fact that some cuckoos get tired after flying for hours. The statement \"Mary loves things of clarity\" suggests that she has a strong preference for clear and sparkling objects, which could explain why she goes crazy over jewelry."}}
{"Q": "They observed apes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They hear sounds from those apes. (B) Most of them suffered from sarcoidosis.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. They hear sounds from those apes.\nExplanation: When observing apes, researchers may use audio recording equipment to capture the sounds made by the apes. This can provide valuable information about their communication and behavior. However, there is no evidence to suggest that observing apes would cause humans to suffer from sarcoidosis, making option B highly implausible."}}
{"Q": "Many of the patients were suffering from demtelinating diseases, including some with multiple sclerosis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Most of them have achondroplasia. (B) Doctors examined them and found many oligodendrocytes in their bodies.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B.\nExplanation: Demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, involve damage to the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers in the central nervous system. Oligodendrocytes are the cells responsible for producing and maintaining this myelin sheath. Therefore, it would be plausible for doctors to find many oligodendrocytes in the bodies of patients with demyelinating diseases. Option A, which suggests that most of the patients have achondroplasia (a genetic disorder that causes dwarfism), is not related to the given information about demyelinating diseases."}}
{"Q": "They found something connected with therapsids. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists recently did a research about mammals. (B) The teacher asked them to study some oldest flowering plants.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Scientists recently did a research about mammals.\nExplanation: Therapsids are a group of mammal-like reptiles that lived during the Permian and Triassic periods. Therefore, it is more likely that scientists were researching about mammals and stumbled upon something related to therapsids rather than a teacher asking students to study oldest flowering plants."}}
{"Q": "She took in enterokinase. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Other enzymes in her body were activated. (B) It tooked in approximately twice the protein levels of grass.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Other enzymes in her body were activated.\n\nExplanation: Enterokinase is an enzyme that activates trypsinogen, which in turn activates other digestive enzymes in the small intestine. Therefore, taking in enterokinase would lead to the activation of other enzymes in the body, aiding in the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Option B is not a plausible answer as enterokinase does not affect protein levels in the diet."}}
{"Q": "There is not enough polypropylene for Tom to do his research. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has to take measures. (B) He tooke use of some polyethylene instead.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He has to take measures.\nExplanation: If there is not enough polypropylene for Tom to do his research, he would have to take measures to find a solution. This could include finding alternative materials, adjusting the scope of his research, or seeking additional funding to purchase more polypropylene. Using polyethylene instead may not be a viable solution as it is a different material with different properties and may not be suitable for his research needs."}}
{"Q": "This instrument can detect any thermal energy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The instrument detected the wave. (B) It tests the energy the Pendula have.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The instrument detected the wave.\nExplanation: Since the instrument can detect any thermal energy, it is more likely that it detected the wave of thermal energy rather than testing the energy of the Pendula. The question does not provide any context or information about the Pendula, so it is safer to assume that the instrument detected the thermal energy wave."}}
{"Q": "Betty was infected with  salmonella. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her baby is no healthy. (B) Betty was having diarrhea.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Betty was having diarrhea.\nExplanation: Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning. The most common symptoms of salmonella infection are diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. While salmonella infection during pregnancy can be dangerous for the baby, the question does not provide any information about Betty's pregnancy. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Betty experienced diarrhea as a result of the salmonella infection."}}
{"Q": "The experimenter found that new substances were produced. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mixing ozone and lightning. (B) The laboratory adopted radioimmunoassays.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Mixing ozone and lightning.\nExplanation: When ozone and lightning are mixed, it can cause chemical reactions that produce new substances. This is a well-known phenomenon in atmospheric chemistry and is often observed during thunderstorms. On the other hand, radioimmunoassays are a laboratory technique used to measure the concentration of specific substances in biological samples, and it is unlikely that they would cause the production of new substances. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The milk tastes sour. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom pasteurized the sour milk. (B) The bacteria in milk has changed.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) The bacteria in milk has changed.\nExplanation: Milk can become sour when the bacteria present in it start to ferment lactose, the sugar in milk, into lactic acid. This process is natural and can happen when milk is left at room temperature for too long or when it is not stored properly. Pasteurization, which is the process of heating milk to kill bacteria, would not cause milk to become sour. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He saw that flounders were among the shortest bars. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom saw a histogram of the survival rate of marine life. (B) Tom looked at a pie chart of nationalities.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tom saw a histogram of the survival rate of marine life.\nExplanation: A histogram is a graph that shows the distribution of data in intervals or bins. In this case, the histogram would show the survival rate of different marine life species. Flounders may have a shorter bar on the histogram because they have a lower survival rate compared to other species. On the other hand, a pie chart would not be relevant to this situation as it shows the proportion of different categories in a whole, such as nationalities, and does not provide information on survival rates."}}
{"Q": "Their weight were under the standard. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) During the war children suffered from a deficiency of food. (B) The athlete was fencing.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. During the war children suffered from a deficiency of food.\nExplanation: It is well-known that during times of war, food shortages and malnutrition are common. This can lead to stunted growth and low body weight in children. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of their low weight was due to a deficiency of food during the war, rather than the athlete participating in fencing."}}
{"Q": "We can eat tomatoes regularly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lycopene is beneficial to us. (B) Ryan wants to eat.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant found in tomatoes that has been linked to numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer. Therefore, it is a more plausible reason for why we can eat tomatoes regularly than simply because someone wants to eat them."}}
{"Q": "Soon the cow will have offsprings. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Humans produce lots of halons today. (B) A cow on the farm is pregnant.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that a cow on the farm is pregnant, which is a natural cause for the cow to have offspring. Option A, which states that humans produce lots of halons today, is not related to the cow's pregnancy and is not a plausible cause for the cow to have offspring."}}
{"Q": "We learned how to comprehend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher taught us how to read. (B) The general used many Missiles.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The teacher taught us how to read.\nExplanation: Comprehension is a skill that is developed through reading and understanding written text. Therefore, it is likely that the cause of learning how to comprehend was due to the teacher teaching the students how to read and understand written material. The use of missiles by a general is not related to the development of reading comprehension skills."}}
{"Q": "Her curse had a beginning with no end. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A scientist puts some nucleolytic enzymes into some series of dna double helix. (B) The cursed girl had a life of eternity.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. The cursed girl had a life of eternity.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible as it suggests that the curse was caused by the girl's immortality, which means she would live forever without any end. This could be due to a magical or supernatural event that occurred in her life, leading to the curse. On the other hand, option A seems less likely as it involves a scientific process that is not directly related to the curse."}}
{"Q": "We can easily find gars in water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Loggerheads atre abundant in the sea. (B) The gar is a kind of fish that needs to breath in water.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Gars are a type of fish that are adapted to living in water and require oxygen from water to breathe. Therefore, it is natural to find them in water. The presence or abundance of loggerhead turtles in the sea does not necessarily have a direct impact on the presence of gars."}}
{"Q": "The number of sheep grew widely and the grassland decreased rapidly thereafter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had many pupae. (B) The local hunters killed too many wolves this year.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (A) He had many pupae.\nExplanation: The growth in the number of sheep suggests that there was a high rate of reproduction among the sheep. This could be due to the presence of many pupae, which are the immature stages of parasites such as fleas, lice, and ticks. These parasites can cause stress and weaken the immune system of the sheep, making them more susceptible to diseases and infections. As a result, the sheep may have reproduced more rapidly to compensate for the loss of individuals due to illness or death. The decrease in grassland could be due to overgrazing by the increased number of sheep, which would have further stressed the ecosystem. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer. Option (B) is unlikely to be the cause of the growth in sheep population and the decrease in grassland, as wolves are not known to prey on sheep in large numbers."}}
{"Q": "Soon, he died of worsening liver disease. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Despite his cirrhosis, Bob still drank heavily. (B) John has asthma.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the person had worsening liver disease, which is often caused by cirrhosis. Choice A states that despite having cirrhosis, the person continued to drink heavily, which can exacerbate the condition and lead to liver failure. Choice B, which mentions asthma, is not related to the cause of liver disease and is therefore an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was going to catch doves. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He paid close attention to the trees. (B) He went to the farm.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He paid close attention to the trees.\nExplanation: Since Tom was going to catch doves, it would make sense for him to pay close attention to the trees where the doves might be perched. Going to the farm (option B) may or may not be related to catching doves, so it is less likely to be the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "The period of summer rains comes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The carbon dioxide, one of the major greenhouse gases, content in the air decreases. (B) Many wildflowers bloom in profusion.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: (B) Many wildflowers bloom in profusion.\nExplanation: Summer rains provide the necessary moisture for plants to grow and bloom. As a result, many wildflowers bloom in profusion during this period. This is a common phenomenon in many regions around the world, where the arrival of summer rains is eagerly awaited by farmers and nature enthusiasts alike. While the carbon dioxide content in the air may fluctuate due to various factors, it is unlikely to be directly affected by the arrival of summer rains."}}
{"Q": "The number of enzymes in Tom's body is over the average number. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can always digest protein better than others. (B) His body is very healthy.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \n\nExplanation: Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in the body, including the breakdown of food molecules. If Tom has more enzymes than the average person, it is likely that he can digest protein better than others, as protein digestion requires specific enzymes. However, the number of enzymes in Tom's body does not necessarily indicate overall health, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This folk eat many root tubers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They grow Dahlias for food. (B) They collect many fibres.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. They collect many fibres.\nExplanation: Root tubers are often rich in starch and fiber. Therefore, it is more plausible that the folk who eat many root tubers would collect many fibers rather than growing dahlias for food, which are not typically used as a food source. Collecting fibers from plants such as cotton, flax, or hemp would provide a valuable source of material for clothing, shelter, and other necessities."}}
{"Q": "Propanol has different properties. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Propanol is a simple example of isomer. (B) Propanol is a compound.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Propanol is a simple example of isomer.\n\nExplanation: Isomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements of atoms. Propanol has two isomers: 1-propanol and 2-propanol (also known as isopropanol). These isomers have different physical and chemical properties, such as boiling points, solubility, and reactivity. Therefore, the different properties of propanol are due to the presence of isomers."}}
{"Q": "Mario is a fastener. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can easily lift a heavy case. (B) He applies solder to many welding surfaces every day.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. \nExplanation: As a fastener, Mario is likely skilled in attaching or securing objects together. This skill does not necessarily involve soldering, which is a separate process. However, being a fastener may require physical strength and dexterity, which could enable Mario to easily lift a heavy case. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Her body had excessive radiation levels. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy overexposed her skin to the ultraviolet rays of the sun. (B) Madame Curie studied radium all her life.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Madame Curie studied radium all her life, which is a highly radioactive element. Exposure to radium can lead to excessive radiation levels in the body, which can cause serious health problems. Amy overexposing her skin to the sun's ultraviolet rays may cause sunburn or skin damage, but it is unlikely to cause excessive radiation levels in the body. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Their company has a team culture. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have unified structures. (B) Everyone, including the boss, is a team player.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: B. Everyone, including the boss, is a team player.\n\nExplanation: When a company has a team culture, it means that the employees work together towards a common goal, and everyone is encouraged to contribute their ideas and skills. This fosters a sense of unity and collaboration among team members, which can lead to better communication, increased productivity, and a more positive work environment. In such a culture, the boss is also expected to be a team player and work alongside their employees, rather than just giving orders and delegating tasks. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The old man ate Benzodiazepines by mistake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was poisoned. (B) He had amnesia.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He was poisoned.\nExplanation: Benzodiazepines are a type of medication used to treat anxiety and insomnia. However, if taken in excessive amounts or by someone who is not prescribed the medication, it can lead to poisoning. Symptoms of benzodiazepine poisoning include drowsiness, confusion, difficulty breathing, and even coma or death in severe cases. Therefore, it is more plausible that the old man was poisoned rather than experiencing amnesia from accidentally taking benzodiazepines."}}
{"Q": "Anna needs an amniocentesis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary wants to detect condition in the fetus. (B) It can't grow normally.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Amniocentesis is a prenatal test that involves taking a sample of amniotic fluid to detect any genetic abnormalities or chromosomal disorders in the fetus. It is usually recommended for women who are at high risk of having a baby with a genetic condition, such as women over the age of 35 or those with a family history of genetic disorders. Therefore, the most plausible reason for Anna needing an amniocentesis is that Mary wants to detect any conditions in the fetus. Option B, \"It can't grow normally,\" is not a common reason for amniocentesis and would require further medical evaluation."}}
{"Q": "He brought good news to others. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His major job is evangelism. (B) Jack used to be a soothsayer.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A.\nExplanation: If someone's major job is evangelism, it is likely that they bring good news to others as a regular part of their work. On the other hand, being a soothsayer (someone who claims to predict the future) does not necessarily involve bringing good news, and it is not clear how this would lead to someone consistently sharing positive information with others. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He tried to caught the bass. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bass bit him with its small mouth. (B) The bass opened its mouth and guzzled his hand.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. He bass bit him with its small mouth.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the bass would bite him with its small mouth as a defensive reaction rather than opening its mouth and guzzling his hand, which seems unlikely and exaggerated."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to the dentist to fix his caries. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The treatment process producedamalgam waste. (B) The doctor said that Tom had high blood pressure.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. The treatment process produced amalgam waste.\nExplanation: When a dentist fixes caries, they typically use dental fillings made of amalgam, which is a mixture of metals including mercury. The process of placing and removing amalgam fillings produces waste that must be properly disposed of to prevent environmental contamination. Therefore, it is more plausible that the treatment process produced amalgam waste rather than the doctor diagnosing Tom with high blood pressure, which is not directly related to dental procedures."}}
{"Q": "He was diagnosed with something wrong with ventricular. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim, who has a medical history with hypertension, recently felt uncomfortable. (B) Jack's lungs were infected with bacteria.", "R": {"text": "\n\nAnswer: A. Tim, who has a medical history with hypertension, recently felt uncomfortable.\nExplanation: Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can cause damage to the heart and blood vessels over time. One of the potential complications of hypertension is ventricular dysfunction, which can lead to heart failure. If Tim has a history of hypertension and is experiencing discomfort, it is possible that his ventricular dysfunction is related to his high blood pressure. On the other hand, Jack's lung infection is unlikely to directly cause ventricular dysfunction."}}
