{"Q": "A revolving door is convenient for two direction travel, but it also serves as a security measure at a what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bank (B) library (C) department store (D) mall (E) new york", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: A revolving door is often used as a security measure at banks because it allows for controlled entry and exit, preventing unauthorized individuals from entering the building. Additionally, the revolving door can also help regulate the flow of people in and out of the bank, making it easier for security personnel to monitor activity. While revolving doors may be found in other types of buildings, such as department stores or malls, they are not typically used as a security measure in those settings."}}
{"Q": "What do people aim to do at work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) complete job (B) learn from each other (C) kill animals (D) wear hats (E) talk to each other", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. complete job\nExplanation: The primary goal of most people at work is to complete their job responsibilities and tasks assigned to them. This helps them to achieve their targets, meet deadlines, and contribute to the success of the organization. While learning from each other and socializing with colleagues are also important aspects of work, they are not the primary objectives. Killing animals and wearing hats are not relevant to most job roles."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find magazines along side many other printed works?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) doctor (B) bookstore (C) market (D) train station (E) mortuary", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Bookstore.\nExplanation: Bookstores typically carry a wide variety of printed works, including magazines. Doctors' offices may have magazines, but they are not typically sold alongside other printed works. Markets and train stations may have newsstands that sell magazines, but they are not typically associated with a wide variety of printed works. Mortuaries are not typically associated with the sale of printed works at all."}}
{"Q": "Where are  you likely to find a hamburger?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) fast food restaurant (B) pizza (C) ground up dead cows (D) mouth (E) cow carcus", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Fast food restaurant.\nExplanation: Hamburgers are a popular menu item at fast food restaurants, such as McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's. These restaurants specialize in quick and convenient meals, making them a likely place to find a hamburger. While ground up dead cows are used to make hamburger meat, it is not a socially acceptable or appropriate answer. Pizza and cow carcass are not related to hamburgers. The mouth is where a person would eat a hamburger, but it is not where one would find a hamburger."}}
{"Q": "James was looking for a good place to buy farmland.  Where might he look?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) midwest (B) countryside (C) estate (D) farming areas (E) illinois", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. farming areas.\nExplanation: If James is looking to buy farmland, it would make sense for him to look in areas where farming is prevalent. The midwest and countryside are both good options, but they are not specific enough. An estate may have farmland, but it is not guaranteed. Illinois is a specific location, but it may not have the best farmland available. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D, farming areas."}}
{"Q": "What island country is ferret popular?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) own home (B) north carolina (C) great britain (D) hutch (E) outdoors", "R": {"text": "Answer: Great Britain.\nExplanation: Ferrets are popular pets in Great Britain and have been domesticated for over 2,000 years. They are often kept as working animals to hunt rabbits and rodents, but also make affectionate and playful pets."}}
{"Q": "In what Spanish speaking North American country can you get a great cup of coffee?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) mildred's coffee shop (B) mexico (C) diner (D) kitchen (E) canteen", "R": {"text": "Answer: Mexico.\nExplanation: Mexico is a Spanish speaking North American country known for its high-quality coffee production. Mexican coffee is grown in several regions, including Chiapas, Veracruz, and Oaxaca, and is known for its rich flavor and smooth finish. Many coffee shops and cafes in Mexico serve delicious coffee, making it a great destination for coffee lovers. Mildred's coffee shop, diner, kitchen, and canteen are not specific to any country and do not necessarily guarantee a great cup of coffee."}}
{"Q": "What do animals do when an enemy is approaching?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) feel pleasure (B) procreate (C) pass water (D) listen to each other (E) sing", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. listen to each other.\nExplanation: When an enemy is approaching, animals often rely on their sense of hearing to detect the threat and communicate with each other. They may make warning calls or signals to alert others in the group, or they may listen for cues from their surroundings to determine the best course of action. This helps them to stay safe and avoid danger. While some animals may exhibit other behaviors in response to a threat, such as fleeing or fighting, listening and communication are essential survival skills for many species."}}
{"Q": "Reading newspaper one of many ways to practice your what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) literacy (B) knowing how to read (C) money (D) buying (E) money bank", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Reading newspaper is a great way to practice your literacy skills, which includes reading, writing, and comprehension. It helps improve vocabulary, grammar, and critical thinking abilities. It also keeps you informed about current events and enhances your general knowledge."}}
{"Q": "What do people typically do while playing guitar?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cry (B) hear sounds (C) singing (D) arthritis (E) making music", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. making music\nExplanation: People typically play guitar to make music, whether it's for personal enjoyment or to perform for others. While some may cry or sing while playing, those actions are not exclusive to playing guitar and are not the primary purpose of playing the instrument. Arthritis may be a concern for some guitar players, but it is not something that people typically do while playing guitar. Hearing sounds is a necessary part of playing guitar, but it is not something that people do while playing guitar as much as it is something that they experience."}}
{"Q": "What would vinyl be an odd thing to replace?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) pants (B) record albums (C) record store (D) cheese (E) wallpaper", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Vinyl is a material commonly used for making records, but it would be odd to replace cheese with vinyl. Cheese is a food item and vinyl is not edible, so it would not be a suitable replacement."}}
{"Q": "If you want harmony, what is something you should try to do with the world?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) take time (B) make noise (C) make war (D) make peace (E) make haste", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: If you want harmony, the best course of action is to make peace with the world. Making war or making noise will only create more conflict and chaos, while taking time or making haste may not necessarily lead to harmony. Making peace involves finding common ground, understanding and respecting differences, and working towards a mutually beneficial solution."}}
{"Q": "Where does a heifer's master live?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) farm house (B) barnyard (C) stockyard (D) slaughter house (E) eat cake", "R": {"text": "Answer: Farm house.\nExplanation: A heifer is a young female cow that is raised on a farm. Therefore, it is most likely that the heifer's master would live in a farm house, which is the main residence on a farm. The other options, such as barnyard, stockyard, and slaughter house, are not places where a master would typically live. The option \"eat cake\" is not a relevant answer to the question."}}
{"Q": "Aside from water and nourishment what does your dog need?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) bone (B) charm (C) petted (D) lots of attention (E) walked", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) lots of attention\nExplanation: Dogs are social animals and require attention and interaction with their owners. Neglecting a dog's need for attention can lead to behavioral issues such as anxiety and destructive behavior. Providing your dog with plenty of attention and affection is essential for their overall well-being."}}
{"Q": "Janet was watching the film because she liked what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) erection (B) laughter (C) being entertained (D) fear (E) bordem", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. being entertained.\nExplanation: It is highly unlikely that Janet was watching the film because of an erection or fear. Laughter could be a reason, but it is not as strong as being entertained. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C, being entertained."}}
{"Q": "What are you waiting alongside with when you're in a reception area?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) motel (B) chair (C) hospital (D) people (E) hotels", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. People.\nExplanation: When you're in a reception area, you're typically waiting for someone or something, such as a meeting, appointment, or service. Therefore, the most plausible answer is people. While chairs may be present for seating, they are not necessarily something you are waiting alongside with. Motels and hotels are places you stay in, not reception areas, and hospitals are places you go to for medical treatment, not necessarily for waiting in a reception area."}}
{"Q": "When drinking booze what can you do to stay busy?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) reach tentative agreement (B) stay in bed (C) stop bicycle (D) examine thing (E) suicide", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. examine thing\nExplanation: When drinking alcohol, it is important to stay occupied and avoid boredom, which can lead to overconsumption. Examining something, such as a book, a piece of art, or even a new gadget, can help keep the mind engaged and distracted from the urge to drink excessively. It can also be a good opportunity to learn something new or appreciate something in a different way."}}
{"Q": "A fencing thrust with a sharp sword towards a person would result in what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) injury (B) small cuts (C) fever (D) competition (E) puncture wound", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. puncture wound\nExplanation: A fencing thrust with a sharp sword towards a person is a deliberate attempt to pierce the opponent's body with the tip of the sword. This would result in a puncture wound, which is a deep and narrow wound caused by a sharp object penetrating the skin and underlying tissues. Injuries, small cuts, and fever are not specific enough to describe the outcome of a fencing thrust, while competition is not an outcome of the thrust itself but rather the context in which it occurs."}}
{"Q": "Unlike a spider and his many sight seers, people only have what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) tongues (B) names (C) brains (D) feelings (E) two eyes", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: Unlike a spider, people only have brains. While spiders have multiple eyes to see their surroundings, humans rely on their brains to process information and make sense of the world around them. The other options (tongues, names, feelings, and two eyes) are all things that humans possess, but they are not unique to humans and do not differentiate us from spiders in the same way that our brains do."}}
{"Q": "Where do adults use glue sticks?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) classroom (B) desk drawer (C) at school (D) office (E) kitchen drawer", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. office\nExplanation: While glue sticks may be used in a classroom or at school, they are also commonly used in offices for various tasks such as crafting, scrapbooking, and labeling. Therefore, it is more plausible that adults use glue sticks in an office setting."}}
{"Q": "What could go on top of wood?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) lumberyard (B) synagogue (C) floor (D) carpet (E) hardware store", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Carpet.\nExplanation: Carpet is a common material that can be placed on top of wood flooring or subflooring to provide a soft and comfortable surface. Lumberyard and hardware store are places where wood and building materials are sold, while a synagogue is a place of worship and not typically associated with wood flooring. While wood can be used as flooring, it is not typically placed on top of other wood surfaces."}}
{"Q": "The artist was sitting quietly pondering, then suddenly he began to paint when what struck him?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sadness (B) anxiety (C) inspiration (D) discomfort (E) insights", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. inspiration.\nExplanation: The word \"suddenly\" suggests that the artist was not actively painting before, but something triggered him to start painting. The word \"pondering\" suggests that the artist was deep in thought, possibly searching for inspiration. Therefore, it is more plausible that the artist was struck by inspiration rather than sadness, anxiety, discomfort, or insights."}}
{"Q": "Though the thin film seemed fragile, for it's intended purpose it was actually nearly what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) indestructible (B) durable (C) undestroyable (D) indestructible (E) unbreakable", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) durable\nExplanation: While the thin film may appear fragile, it is likely designed to withstand the specific conditions and stresses of its intended purpose. Therefore, it is more likely to be durable rather than completely indestructible or unbreakable."}}
{"Q": "Where could you find a toilet that only friends can use?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) rest area (B) school (C) stadium (D) apartment (E) hospital", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. apartment\nExplanation: It is common for apartments to have a locked or restricted access to certain amenities, such as a pool or gym, that are only available to residents and their guests. It is plausible that an apartment complex may have a similar system for a private restroom that is only accessible to residents and their invited friends. Rest areas, schools, stadiums, and hospitals are all public places where it would be unlikely to have a toilet exclusively for friends."}}
{"Q": "What is someone who isn't clever, bright, or competent called?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) clumsy (B) ineffectual (C) dull (D) clumsy (E) stupid", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. dull\nExplanation: Someone who is not clever, bright, or competent can be described as dull, meaning lacking in interest or excitement, or lacking in sharpness or intensity. The other options, such as clumsy or ineffectual, may imply a lack of physical coordination or ability, but do not necessarily relate to intelligence or competence. Stupid may be too harsh and offensive of a term to use in most situations."}}
{"Q": "When wildlife reproduce we often refer to what comes out as what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) raise children (B) have children (C) photo copy (D) offspring (E) accidently got pregnant somehow", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Offspring.\nExplanation: Offspring is the correct term used to refer to the young ones produced by wildlife during reproduction. It is a more scientific and accurate term than the other options provided. The term \"raise children\" is more commonly used for human reproduction, while \"photo copy\" and \"accidentally got pregnant somehow\" are not appropriate or professional terms to use."}}
{"Q": "The weasel was becoming a problem, it kept getting into the chicken eggs kept in the what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) forrest (B) barn (C) public office (D) out of doors (E) freezer", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) barn\nExplanation: It is common for farmers to keep their chickens and their eggs in a barn. Weasels are known to be predators of chickens and their eggs, so it is likely that the weasel was getting into the barn to access the eggs. The other options, such as a forest or public office, are not likely places for chicken eggs to be kept. The freezer is also an unlikely option, as it would not be practical to keep all the eggs in a freezer."}}
{"Q": "Blue read material outside of his comfort zone because he wanted to gain what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) new perspective (B) entertained (C) understanding (D) hunger (E) tired eyes", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Blue read material outside of his comfort zone because he wanted to gain a new perspective. This suggests that he was seeking to broaden his understanding and knowledge by exploring new ideas and viewpoints. It shows a willingness to challenge his own beliefs and expand his horizons, which is a valuable trait for personal growth and development."}}
{"Q": "After he got hired he hoped for success at his what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) vocation (B) new job (C) michigan (D) working hard (E) manual", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. new job\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the person got hired, which implies that he started a new job. Therefore, it is more plausible that he hoped for success at his new job rather than his vocation, Michigan, working hard, or manual labor."}}
{"Q": "Committing perjury is a serious what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) indictment (B) crime (C) violence (D) lie (E) go to jail", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. crime\nExplanation: Perjury is the act of lying under oath in a court of law or in a legal document. It is considered a crime because it undermines the integrity of the justice system and can lead to wrongful convictions or acquittals. Those who commit perjury can face fines, imprisonment, and other legal consequences."}}
{"Q": "If you are prone to postpone work what will you have to do in order to finish on time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) eat (B) hasten (C) antedate (D) bring forward (E) advance", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. hasten\nExplanation: If you are prone to postpone work, you will need to hasten in order to finish on time. Hastening means to do something quickly or to hurry up. This is the most plausible answer as it directly addresses the issue of procrastination and suggests a solution to complete the work on time. Eating, antedating, bringing forward, and advancing are not relevant or effective solutions to the problem of procrastination."}}
{"Q": "James wanted to find an old underground map from the 50s.  Where might he look for one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) library (B) subway station (C) county engineer's office (D) super market (E) home", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. library\nExplanation: The library is a common place to find historical documents and maps. They often have archives and special collections that may include old maps, including underground maps from the 1950s. The other options, such as a subway station or supermarket, are less likely to have such a specific and historical document. The county engineer's office may have maps, but they are more likely to be current and related to infrastructure projects rather than historical records."}}
{"Q": "Sean was in a rush to get home, but the light turned yellow and he was forced to do what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) take time (B) dawdle (C) go slowly (D) ocean (E) slow down", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: When the light turns yellow, it is a signal for drivers to slow down and prepare to stop. Therefore, Sean was forced to slow down."}}
{"Q": "Where would a person be doing when having to wait their turn?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) have patience (B) get in line (C) sing (D) stand in line (E) turn left", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) stand in line\nExplanation: When having to wait their turn, a person would typically stand in line, especially in situations such as waiting to order food, buy tickets, or board a plane. While having patience is important, it is not a physical action that a person would be doing while waiting in line. Singing or turning left are also not relevant actions in this context. Getting in line is similar to standing in line and could also be a plausible answer, but standing in line is a more commonly used phrase."}}
{"Q": "She was always helping at the senior center, it brought her what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) satisfaction (B) heart (C) feel better (D) pay (E) happiness", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the woman found something positive in helping at the senior center. The most plausible answer from the choices is satisfaction, as it implies a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment from doing something good for others. The other choices, such as heart, feel better, pay, and happiness, do not fit as well with the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "The lock kept the steering wheel from moving, but the thief still took his chances and began to work on the what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) keep cloesd (B) train (C) ignition switch (D) drawer (E) firearm", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. ignition switch\nExplanation: The lock on the steering wheel would prevent the thief from physically turning the wheel, but it would not prevent them from attempting to start the car. Therefore, the thief would likely begin to work on the ignition switch in order to start the car and drive away. The other options (keep closed, train, drawer, firearm) do not make sense in the context of a car theft."}}
{"Q": "Who is a police officer likely to work for?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) beat (B) direct traffic (C) city (D) street (E) president", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. city.\nExplanation: Police officers are typically employed by a city's police department or law enforcement agency. They work to maintain public safety and enforce laws within the city limits. While they may work a beat or direct traffic as part of their duties, their ultimate employer is the city government."}}
{"Q": "If you have leftover cake, where would you put it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) quandry (B) refrigerator (C) oven (D) night stand (E) bakery", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. refrigerator\nExplanation: Leftover cake should be stored in the refrigerator to keep it fresh and prevent it from spoiling. The cold temperature of the refrigerator will slow down the growth of bacteria and mold, which can cause the cake to go bad. It is important to cover the cake with plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent it from drying out or absorbing any odors from other foods in the fridge."}}
{"Q": "A human wants to submerge himself in water, what should he use?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) whirlpool bath (B) coffee cup (C) cup (D) soft drink (E) puddle", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. whirlpool bath\nExplanation: A whirlpool bath is a large tub filled with water that has jets that create a swirling motion, allowing a person to fully submerge themselves in the water. The other choices, such as a coffee cup, cup, soft drink, or puddle, are not large enough or deep enough to allow a person to fully submerge themselves."}}
{"Q": "Where is a doormat likely to be in front of?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) facade (B) front door (C) doorway (D) entrance porch (E) hallway", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. front door.\nExplanation: A doormat is typically placed in front of the front door of a house or building to help clean shoes and prevent dirt from being tracked inside. While it is possible for a doormat to be in front of other areas such as a doorway or entrance porch, the most common and plausible location is in front of the front door."}}
{"Q": "Bob the lizard lives in a warm place with lots of water.  Where does he probably live?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) rock (B) tropical rainforest (C) jazz club (D) new mexico (E) rocky places", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. tropical rainforest.\nExplanation: Bob the lizard is described as living in a warm place with lots of water. Tropical rainforests are known for their warm and humid climates, as well as their abundance of water sources such as rivers, streams, and rainfall. Lizards are also commonly found in tropical rainforests, making this the most plausible answer. The other choices, such as rock, rocky places, jazz club, and New Mexico, do not fit the description of a warm place with lots of water."}}
{"Q": "August needed  money because he was afraid that he'd be kicked out of his house.  What did he need money to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) control people (B) pay bills (C) hurt people (D) buy food (E) get things", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: August needed money to pay bills in order to avoid being kicked out of his house. The other options (controlling people, hurting people, buying food, getting things) do not directly relate to the fear of being evicted from his home."}}
{"Q": "He needed more information to fix it, so he consulted the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) chickens (B) google (C) newspaper (D) online (E) manual", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. manual\nExplanation: A manual is a document that provides detailed information and instructions on how to operate or fix a particular device or system. In this case, the person needed more information to fix something, so consulting a manual would be a logical choice. The other options, such as chickens, google, newspaper, and online, do not provide relevant information for fixing something."}}
{"Q": "Where can you put a picture frame when it's not hung vertically?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) art show (B) wall (C) newspaper (D) car (E) table", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. table\nExplanation: When a picture frame is not hung vertically, it can be placed on a flat surface such as a table. This allows the frame to be displayed and viewed easily without the need for hanging hardware. The other options, such as an art show, wall, newspaper, or car, do not make as much sense as they do not provide a stable or appropriate surface for displaying a picture frame."}}
{"Q": "James knew that he shouldn't have been buying beer for minors.  He didn't even get paid for it.  Why was this bad?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) lose money (B) fun (C) have no money (D) broken law (E) relaxation", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Buying beer for minors is illegal and can result in serious consequences, such as fines and even imprisonment. James could have faced legal charges for his actions, which is why it was a bad decision. The other choices (A, B, C, and E) are not relevant to the situation and do not explain why buying beer for minors is bad."}}
{"Q": "What is the result of applying for  job?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) anxiety and fear (B) increased workload (C) praise (D) less sleep (E) being employed", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. being employed\nExplanation: The result of applying for a job is typically the possibility of being offered employment. While there may be some anxiety and fear associated with the application process, and potentially increased workload if hired, the ultimate goal is to secure employment and begin working. Praise and less sleep are not necessarily common outcomes of applying for a job."}}
{"Q": "What must someone do before they shop?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) get money (B) have money (C) bring cash (D) go to market (E) bring cash", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. get money\nExplanation: Before someone can shop, they need to have the means to pay for their purchases. This usually involves getting money from an ATM or bank beforehand, or making sure they have enough funds in their account if using a debit or credit card. Simply having money or bringing cash (choices B and E) assumes that the person already has the necessary funds on hand, which may not always be the case. Going to the market (choice D) is also not necessarily a prerequisite for shopping, as people can shop online or at other types of stores."}}
{"Q": "Because John was first violin, he had to bring something important to work ever day. What did he need to bring to work?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) music store (B) obesity (C) symphony orchestra (D) ochestra (E) violin case", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. violin case\nExplanation: As John was the first violin in the symphony orchestra, it is likely that he needed to bring his violin case to work every day. The violin case would contain his instrument, bow, and possibly other accessories needed for his performance. The other options, such as a music store or obesity, do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What is a place that usually does not have an elevator and that sometimes has a telephone book?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) at hotel (B) kitchen (C) library (D) telephone booth (E) house", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. telephone booth\nExplanation: Telephone booths are small, enclosed spaces that are typically found on street corners or in public areas. They are not usually equipped with elevators, as they are only one or two stories tall. Additionally, some telephone booths may have a telephone book available for users to look up phone numbers. While the other options may also sometimes have a telephone book, they are more likely to have elevators and are not as commonly associated with telephone books as telephone booths."}}
{"Q": "Who is likely to be excited about a crab?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) fish market (B) pet shop (C) fishmongers (D) intertidal zone (E) obesity", "R": {"text": "Answer: Intertidal zone.\nExplanation: The intertidal zone is the area where the land meets the sea, and it is home to a variety of marine creatures, including crabs. Therefore, those who are interested in marine life and ecology are likely to be excited about a crab. Fish markets and fishmongers may also be interested in crabs, but their excitement would be more related to the commercial value of the crab rather than its ecological significance. Pet shops and obesity are not relevant to the excitement about a crab."}}
{"Q": "Where can a human find clothes that aren't pants?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pants shop (B) on planet earth (C) dress shop (D) school (E) train wreck", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. Dress shop.\nExplanation: While pants are a common clothing item, there are many other options available for humans such as skirts, dresses, shorts, and jumpsuits. A dress shop would likely have a variety of non-pant options for clothing. The other options listed are either irrelevant (train wreck, school) or do not offer a wide range of clothing options (pants shop)."}}
{"Q": "If I was getting drunk, and people couldn't understand me, what might I be having?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) a seizure (B) slurred speech (C) death (D) forgetfulness (E) pass out", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. slurred speech\nExplanation: When someone is getting drunk, their speech can become slurred and difficult to understand. This is due to the effects of alcohol on the brain and nervous system, which can impair coordination and communication skills. A seizure, death, forgetfulness, or passing out are all possible consequences of excessive alcohol consumption, but slurred speech is a more likely symptom in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "When a person is beginning work, what are they building?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) time (B) accomplishing (C) working (D) momentum (E) tiredness", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: When a person is beginning work, they are building momentum. Momentum refers to the force or speed of movement gained by a person or object. In the context of work, building momentum means getting into a productive rhythm and making progress towards completing tasks. It is important to build momentum early on in order to maintain motivation and efficiency throughout the workday."}}
{"Q": "A child wants to play, what would they likely want?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) fall down (B) breathe (C) play tag (D) be dismembered by a chainsaw (E) become adult", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. play tag.\nExplanation: Children typically enjoy playing games and being active, and playing tag is a common and fun game for children to play with their friends. Options A, B, and D are not typical desires for a child, and option E is not a realistic or feasible desire."}}
{"Q": "Talking to the same person about the same thing over and over again is something someone can what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) social life (B) friendship (C) eye contact (D) get tired of (E) learn lessons from", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: It is natural for someone to get tired of talking to the same person about the same thing repeatedly.

{"Q": "The freeway had no traffic and few buildings, where is it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) california (B) countryside (C) big town (D) florida (E) america", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. countryside\nExplanation: The description of the freeway having no traffic and few buildings suggests that it is in a less populated area, such as the countryside. California and Florida are both states with large urban areas and heavy traffic, while \"America\" is too broad of a location to make a specific assumption. \"Big town\" is also a vague description and could still have more traffic and buildings than what is described in the question."}}

This type of environment often leads to the formation of deserts, which are characterized by sandy terrain. Therefore, option C, sandy, is the most plausible answer. Options A, B, D, and E are not likely because they do not accurately describe a hot and arid environment."}}
{"Q": "What is likely to satisfy someone's curiosity?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) hear news (B) read book (C) see favorite show (D) comedy show (E) go somewhere", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) read book.\nExplanation: Reading a book is likely to satisfy someone's curiosity as it provides in-depth information and knowledge on a particular topic or subject.

{"Q": "Where would a computer user be using their own computer?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) hell (B) school (C) indoors (D) internet cafe (E) house", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: It is most likely that a computer user would be using their own computer at home, as it is a personal device that they have purchased and set up for their own use. While they may also use computers at school or in an internet cafe, these are not as likely to be their own personal computers. The option of \"hell\" is obviously not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Crabs live in what sort of environment?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) maritime (B) bodies of water (C) saltwater (D) galapagos (E) fish market", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. saltwater\nExplanation: Crabs are primarily found in saltwater environments such as oceans, seas, and estuaries. While they may also be found in bodies of freshwater, they are more commonly associated with saltwater habitats. The other options, such as maritime and Galapagos, are too specific and do not encompass the broader range of environments where crabs can be found. The option of a fish market is not a natural environment for crabs, but rather a place where they may be sold or consumed by humans."}}
{"Q": "Where can you find a snake in tall grass?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) tree (B) in a jar (C) pet shops (D) feild (E) tropical forest", "R": {"text": "Answer: Field.\nExplanation: Snakes are commonly found in tall grasses in fields, as they use the cover to hide and hunt for prey. While snakes can also be found in trees and tropical forests, these habitats are not as commonly associated with snakes in tall grass. Snakes are not typically found in jars, as this would be an unnatural environment for them, and pet shops may sell snakes but they are not typically found in tall grasses."}}

{"Q": "Where is a human likely to go as a result of being hungry?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) eat in restaurant (B) make bread (C) have lunch (D) cook dinner (E) friends house", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. eat in restaurant\nExplanation: When a human is hungry, the most likely option is to go to a restaurant to eat. This is because it is convenient and provides immediate access to food. Making bread or cooking dinner requires time and effort, which may not be feasible when someone is hungry. Having lunch or going to a friend's house may also be options, but they are less likely than going to a restaurant."}}
{"Q": "He was beginning to regret taking the fight when he saw how what his opponent was?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) fun (B) joy (C) satisfaction (D) confident (E) pride", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (D) confident because regretting taking a fight usually means that the person is intimidated or unsure of their ability to win. Seeing their opponent's confidence would only add to their own feelings of doubt and regret. The other options (A) fun, (B) joy, (C) satisfaction, and (E) pride do not make sense in this context."}}

{"Q": "Where is a good idea but not required to have a fire extinguisher?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) school bus (B) boat (C) house (D) hospital (E) school", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. boat\nExplanation: While it is always a good idea to have a fire extinguisher in any location, it is not required by law to have one on a boat. However, boats are at a higher risk for fires due to the presence of flammable materials and the potential for fuel leaks. Therefore, having a fire extinguisher on board can be crucial in case of an emergency."}}

{"Q": "Sally used a clipboard to hold her papers while she read off names at the beginning of the day.  Where might she work?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) desk (B) windows 95 (C) office supply store (D) see work (E) school", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Sally is likely working at a school, as she is reading off names at the beginning of the day and using a clipboard to hold her papers.

{"Q": "Where does a wild bird usually live?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cage (B) sky (C) countryside (D) desert (E) windowsill", "R": {"text": "Answer: (C) countryside\nExplanation: Wild birds usually live in their natural habitats, which are typically found in the countryside, such as forests, fields, and wetlands. They are not meant to be kept in cages or on windowsills, and they do not typically inhabit deserts. The sky is where they fly, but it is not a place where they live permanently."}}
{"Q": "Where would you expect to find white mice?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) bell cat (B) bush (C) attic (D) countryside (E) laboratory", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. laboratory\nExplanation: White mice are commonly used in laboratory experiments and research, so it is most likely to find them in a laboratory setting. The other options, such as a bell cat or bush, do not make sense in terms of where white mice would naturally occur or be commonly found. While mice can be found in attics and the countryside, the question specifically asks about white mice, which are not as common in these environments."}}
{"Q": "John felt that his actions were fate.   Harry said that he could have always made a different what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) free will (B) choice (C) will (D) alcohol (E) freedom", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Harry is suggesting that John had the ability to make different choices, indicating that he believes in the concept of free will."}}

He could still do what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) michigan (B) walk (C) stay still (D) stink (E) hands", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence states that George didn't have a car, but he still had his two feet. This implies that he can walk, which is the most plausible answer from the given choices. The sentence also mentions that his socks were smelly and his soles were blistered, which further supports the idea that he was walking."}}
{"Q": "A crane uses many a steel cable when working a what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) abaft (B) ship (C) winch (D) construction site (E) building", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. construction site\nExplanation: A crane is commonly used in construction sites to lift heavy materials and equipment.

It is designed specifically for this purpose and provides a secure and organized way to store loose change. A wallet is typically used for paper money and credit cards, not coins. A toy or the ground are not practical or secure options for saving money. While a pocket is a possible option, it may not be the most reliable as the penny could easily fall out or get lost."}}
{"Q": "Where would you put uncooked crab meat?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) wharf (B) red lobster (C) tidepools (D) boss's office (E) stew pot", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. stew pot\nExplanation: Uncooked crab meat should be stored in a cool place, such as a refrigerator or freezer, until it is ready to be cooked. The stew pot is not a storage location, but it is where the crab meat would eventually end up being cooked. The other options, such as the wharf or tidepools, are not appropriate for storing uncooked crab meat as they are exposed to the elements and could spoil quickly. Red Lobster is a restaurant chain and not a storage location. The boss's office is also not a suitable place for storing food."}}
{"Q": "The man had a fear of illness, so he never visited friends who were a what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sick person (B) hospital (C) elderly person (D) graveyard (E) doctor's office", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. sick person\nExplanation: The man's fear of illness suggests that he would avoid being around people who are sick, so it is most likely that he would not visit friends who were sick. The other options (hospital, elderly person, graveyard, doctor's office) do not necessarily indicate that the person is sick, so they are less likely to be the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "Where would you put pans if you want to bring them with you?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cooking (B) cook food (C) kitchen (D) backpack (E) drawer", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. backpack\nExplanation: If you want to bring pans with you, the most plausible option would be to put them in a backpack.

African continent.\nExplanation: The African continent is home to a wide variety of monkey species, including baboons, colobus monkeys, vervet monkeys, and many others. The continent's diverse habitats, from rainforests to savannas, provide ideal environments for these primates to thrive. While the Amazon Basin in South America is also known for its monkey populations, the African continent is likely home to the most monkeys overall. Choices B, C, and D are clearly not plausible answers as they are not large land masses and are unlikely to be home to significant monkey populations."}}

They planned on going to bed early so that they could spend a long time doing what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) rest (B) insomnia (C) making love (D) sleeping in (E) texting", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. making love.\nExplanation: It is common for couples to celebrate anniversaries by spending intimate time together, and \"making love\" is a more plausible answer than the other options given."}}
{"Q": "The teens were trying to hide that they get drink, but when they walked in the door their what gave it away?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) health (B) fall down (C) stagger (D) get arrested (E) vomit", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the teens were staggering when they walked in the door, which would give away that they had been drinking. Health, fall down, and vomit are all possible consequences of drinking too much, but they wouldn't necessarily give away that the teens had been drinking before they walked in the door. Getting arrested is also a possible consequence of underage drinking, but it wouldn't necessarily happen immediately upon walking in the door."}}
{"Q": "You'll find a landing at the top of what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) ocean (B) apartment building (C) stairwell (D) airport (E) room", "R": {"text": "Answer: Airport.\nExplanation: A landing is a designated area for an aircraft to land and take off.

{"Q": "Where can you find a number of wind instruments together in public?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) music store (B) create music (C) zoo (D) music room (E) symphony", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. symphony\nExplanation: A symphony is a large orchestra that typically includes a variety of wind instruments such as flutes, clarinets, oboes, bassoons, and horns. Attending a symphony performance is a great way to hear a number of wind instruments played together in public. Music stores may have a selection of wind instruments, but they are not typically played together in public. Creating music may involve wind instruments, but it is not a public setting. Zoos do not typically have wind instruments on display or played together in public. Music rooms may have a variety of instruments, but they are typically found in schools or private settings, not in public."}}

Toronto.\nExplanation: The term \"mountie\" is often used to refer to a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is based in Canada. Therefore, it is more likely that the mountie would be in a Canadian city, and Toronto is a major urban area with a subway system."}}
{"Q": "What do you want someone to do when you illustrate point?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) did not understand (B) accepting (C) make clear (D) understood (E) understanding", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. make clear\nExplanation: When you illustrate a point, you want someone to have a clear understanding of what you are trying to convey.

By intentionally making time for fun, Billy may be prioritizing his own happiness and taking steps to improve his quality of life."}}

{"Q": "What would you be unable to do if you have too much greed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) keep things (B) make friends (C) play poker (D) conquer opponent (E) lie", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If you have too much greed, you may prioritize your own interests over others, making it difficult to form genuine connections and friendships.

{"Q": "It was a long trip from the farm, so he stayed in a hotel when he arrived at the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) bed away from home (B) wwii bunker (C) resort (D) las vegas (E) city", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. city\nExplanation: The fact that the trip was long suggests that the destination was far away from the farm. A resort or Las Vegas would be unlikely to be located far away from a farm, and a WWII bunker would not be a typical place to stay for a traveler. A bed away from home is too vague and could refer to any type of accommodation. Therefore, staying in a hotel in a city would be the most plausible option for a traveler arriving from a farm after a long trip."}}
{"Q": "I did not need a servant.  I was not a what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) freedom (B) rich person (C) hired help (D) in charge (E) busy", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. rich person.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that the speaker did not require a servant, which is typically associated with wealthy individuals who can afford to hire help. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the speaker is not a rich person."}}
{"Q": "How would you get from one side of a canal to another?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) michigan (B) amsterdam (C) venice (D) bridge (E) barges to travel on", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Bridge.\nExplanation: While barges may be used in some canals, they are not a reliable or common method of transportation for crossing a canal. Michigan is a state and not a specific location with a canal, and Amsterdam and Venice are cities known for their canals but do not provide a specific method of crossing. Therefore, the most plausible answer is a bridge, which is a common and reliable method of crossing canals."}}
{"Q": "When learning about the world and different cultures, what is important if you are committed to eliminating preconceived notions", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) newness (B) loss of innocence (C) enlightenment (D) open mind (E) smartness", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Having an open mind is crucial when learning about the world and different cultures if you are committed to eliminating preconceived notions.

The ability to multitask allowed for more efficient workflow management and increased productivity, making it an underrated but crucial aspect of computer technology."}}
{"Q": "Obstructing justice is sometimes an excuse used for police brutality which causes what in people?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) committing perjury (B) prosecution (C) attack (D) getting hurt (E) riot", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Obstructing justice can lead to police using excessive force, which can result in people getting hurt. This can include physical injuries such as bruises, broken bones, or even death. It can also cause emotional trauma and long-term psychological effects. While committing perjury or attacking the police may also be consequences of police brutality, getting hurt is the most likely outcome. Rioting may occur as a result of police brutality, but it is not a direct consequence of obstructing justice. Prosecution may also occur, but it is not a direct result of police brutality."}}

This can cause permanent damage to the clothes and may require them to be repaired or replaced. Wet clothes and wear out are not the most likely outcomes of getting caught on a sharp object, and having fun is not a plausible answer in this context."}}
{"Q": "Seafood restaurants are used to draw tourists where?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) maine (B) shoe shop (C) city (D) boston (E) coastal cities", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Seafood restaurants are typically located in coastal cities where fresh seafood is readily available. These cities often attract tourists who are interested in trying local cuisine and experiencing the coastal culture. Maine and Boston are both coastal cities known for their seafood, so they could also be plausible answers, but \"coastal cities\" is a more general and inclusive option. \"Shoe shop\" and \"city\" are not relevant to the question."}}

Therefore, the most plausible answer is family tree, as it would provide her with information about her grandfather's ancestors and relatives. The other options, such as family reunion, babysitting, brother's house, and heirlooms, do not seem relevant to her inquiry about her grandfather."}}
{"Q": "James looked up and saw the start twinkling in the black yonder.  He marveled the sheer number of them and the size of what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) universe (B) orbit (C) night sky (D) outer space (E) his wallet", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. universe\nExplanation: The sentence mentions James marveling at the sheer number of stars and their size, which suggests that he is contemplating the vastness of the universe.

{"Q": "What would encourage someone to continue playing tennis?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) becoming tired (B) tennis elbow (C) exercise (D) hunger (E) victory", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. exercise\nExplanation: Exercise is a common reason why people continue playing tennis. Tennis is a great form of exercise that can improve cardiovascular health, build muscle strength, and increase flexibility. Additionally, regular exercise can lead to improved overall health and well-being, which can be a motivating factor for continuing to play tennis. Becoming tired or experiencing tennis elbow would likely discourage someone from playing, while hunger is not typically a motivating factor for continuing to play. Victory may be a motivating factor for some, but it is not as consistent or sustainable as the benefits of regular exercise."}}

It was so relaxing he almost did what despite his efforts?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) deep breathing (B) worried (C) fall asleep (D) invigorating (E) feeling good", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. fall asleep.\nExplanation: The sentence states that James found the sound relaxing to the point where he almost did something despite his efforts. The most plausible option from the given choices is falling asleep, as relaxing sounds can often make people feel drowsy and calm. Deep breathing and feeling good are also possible options, but they do not necessarily imply that James was struggling to resist the urge to do them. Worried and invigorating are unlikely options, as they are opposite in meaning to the word \"relaxing\" used in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What regions of a town would you have found a dime store?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) commercial building (B) old movie (C) small neighborhood (D) past (E) mall", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. commercial building\nExplanation: Dime stores were typically located in commercial buildings in the downtown area of a town. These stores were known for selling a variety of inexpensive items such as toys, household goods, and clothing. They were popular in the mid-20th century but have since been replaced by larger retail chains and online shopping."}}
{"Q": "Where might an unused chess set be stored?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) toy store (B) michigan (C) living room (D) attic (E) cupboard", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Attic.\nExplanation: An unused chess set is likely to be stored in a place where it won't take up too much space and won't be in the way of everyday activities. The attic is a common storage area for items that are not frequently used but still need to be kept in good condition. It is also a place where people often store items that they want to keep out of sight but don't want to get rid of. Therefore, it is more plausible that an unused chess set would be stored in an attic rather than a toy store, Michigan, living room, or cupboard."}}
{"Q": "james told his son to settle down and be careful.  There were many frogs mating in the area, and James didn't want his son to do what to them?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) wander (B) migrate (C) scare (D) disturb (E) agitate", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. disturb\nExplanation: James is warning his son to be careful because there are many frogs mating in the area. If his son were to disturb the frogs, it could disrupt their mating process and potentially harm them. Therefore, the most plausible answer is \"disturb.\""}}
{"Q": "A man wants air conditioning while we watches the game on Saturday, where will it likely be installed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) car (B) house (C) offices (D) park (E) movie theatre", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. house\nExplanation: It is most likely that the man would want air conditioning installed in his house while he watches the game on Saturday. Installing air conditioning in a car or park would not be practical, and it is unlikely that offices or movie theaters would be open for him to watch the game."}}
{"Q": "What could be playing a balailaika?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) movie dr (B) orchestra (C) music store (D) cat (E) symphony", "R": {"text": "Answer: Orchestra.\nExplanation: A balailaika is a traditional Russian stringed instrument commonly used in folk music. It is often played in orchestras that specialize in Russian or Eastern European music. While it is possible for a music store to have a balailaika for sale or for a cat to play with one, it is much more likely that an orchestra would be playing the instrument in a musical performance. A movie or symphony could also feature a balailaika, but without further context, it is less likely than an orchestra."}}
{"Q": "Sailors drive many different types of boats, what type of boat involves their namesake.", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) coming home (B) row boat (C) board ship (D) inflatable raft (E) sail boat", "R": {"text": "Answer: Sail boat.\nExplanation: Sailors are named after the type of boat they operate, which is a sail boat. This type of boat is propelled by wind using sails and is commonly used for recreational activities, racing, and transportation. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer among the given choices."}}
{"Q": "Where could a person avoid the rain?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bus stop (B) tunnel (C) synagogue (D) fairy tale (E) street corner", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. tunnel\nExplanation: A tunnel provides shelter from the rain as it is covered and protected from the elements. A bus stop or street corner may have a roof, but it may not provide enough coverage from the rain. A synagogue may not be accessible or open to the public at all times. A fairy tale is not a physical location and cannot provide shelter from the rain."}}
{"Q": "Why would a person like to have a large house?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) have choice (B) mentally challenged (C) own house (D) obesity (E) lots of space", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. have choice\nExplanation: A person may like to have a large house because it provides them with more choices. With more space, they can have more rooms for different purposes, such as a home office, a gym, or a guest room. They may also have more storage space and be able to keep more possessions. Having a large house can give a person the freedom to design and decorate their home in a way that suits their lifestyle and preferences."}}
{"Q": "Where will a cheap book be found?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bookstore (B) classroom (C) discount store (D) school room (E) bedside table", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. discount store.\nExplanation: Discount stores often offer lower prices on books compared to traditional bookstores. While books may also be found in classrooms, school rooms, and on bedside tables, these locations do not necessarily guarantee a cheap price."}}
{"Q": "John and James are idiots. They bought two tickets to the Falcons vs the Jets even though neither wanted to see the what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) internet cafe (B) sporting event (C) pressing wrong buttons (D) obesity (E) hockey game", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The other options (A, C, D) do not make sense in the context of buying tickets to a sporting event. Option B is a possibility, but the fact that neither John nor James wanted to see it suggests that they are not interested in sports, making option E (hockey game) a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "James noticed that his penis was bigger. .  How might he act toward his plastic surgeon?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) accidental (B) detestable (C) effusive (D) enabled (E) apathetic", "R": {"text": "Answer: (C) effusive\nExplanation: James might act effusive towards his plastic surgeon, expressing gratitude and excitement about the results of the surgery."}}
{"Q": "Who do professors work with?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) methods of facts (B) teach courses (C) wear wrinkled tweed jackets (D) school students (E) state facts", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Professors typically work with school students, whether it be teaching courses, advising them on research projects, or mentoring them in their academic and professional pursuits. While they may use methods of facts and state facts in their teaching and research, and some may even wear wrinkled tweed jackets, these are not the primary groups or activities that professors work with."}}
{"Q": "Colorful anemone look somewhat like what object you find on window sills?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) intertidal zone (B) coral sea (C) under water (D) flower bed (E) florida keys", "R": {"text": "Answer: Flower bed.\nExplanation: Colorful anemones are often found in shallow waters and have a flower-like appearance with their tentacles resembling petals. This makes them look similar to flowers found in a flower bed. They are not typically found in the intertidal zone or coral sea, but rather in areas with rocky or sandy bottoms where they can attach themselves. While they are found underwater, the specific appearance of colorful anemones is more reminiscent of a flower bed than the Florida Keys."}}
{"Q": "From where do aliens arrive?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) outer space (B) weekly world news (C) roswell (D) universe (E) mars", "R": {"text": "Answer: Universe.\nExplanation: The universe is vast and contains billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars. It is highly likely that there are other intelligent life forms out there in the universe. While we have not yet made contact with any aliens, the possibility of their existence cannot be ruled out. Therefore, it is more plausible to say that aliens could arrive from the universe rather than from a specific location like Mars or Roswell."}}
{"Q": "The hikers stopped to have a drink, simply put they what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) had a party (B) were thirsty (C) refreshment (D) getting drunk (E) celebrating", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. were thirsty.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the hikers stopped to have a drink, which implies that they were thirsty and needed to quench their thirst. The other options such as having a party, getting drunk, or celebrating are not supported by the given information and are unlikely scenarios. Refreshment could be a possible option, but it is too vague and does not provide a clear explanation of what the hikers were doing. Therefore, option B, were thirsty, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "When you get up in the morning before you begin work you should do what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) apply for job (B) sleep (C) concentrate (D) shower (E) just do", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Shower.\nExplanation: Taking a shower in the morning can help you feel refreshed and ready to start your day. It can also help you feel more awake and alert, which can improve your concentration and productivity at work. Additionally, starting your day with good hygiene habits can help you feel more confident and prepared to tackle any challenges that come your way."}}
{"Q": "The kitten had nothing to dig it's claws into, so when it tried to stop it slid across what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) living room (B) floor (C) warm place (D) carpet (E) farmhouse", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (D) carpet because carpets are commonly found in homes and are a common surface for cats to slide on if they cannot dig their claws into anything. The other options, such as (A) living room, (B) floor, (C) warm place, and (E) farmhouse, do not provide a specific surface that would cause the kitten to slide."}}
{"Q": "If a person is trying to keep something in their hand what should they do?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) complete collection (B) own house (C) procrastinate (D) explode (E) have to hold", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. have to hold\nExplanation: If a person is trying to keep something in their hand, the most plausible answer would be to have to hold it. This means that the person needs to physically grasp and hold onto the object to keep it in their hand. The other options, such as completing a collection or procrastinating, do not relate to the action of physically holding onto an object. Owning a house or exploding are also not relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Where could you find hundreds of thousands of home?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) field (B) neighborhood (C) star can (D) city or town (E) apartment building", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. city or town.\nExplanation: Cities and towns are typically populated with hundreds of thousands of homes, whereas fields and star cans are not typically residential areas. Neighborhoods and apartment buildings may have a significant number of homes, but not necessarily hundreds of thousands."}}
{"Q": "Playing baseball is a lot like any other sport, there is always a risk of what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) sore muscles (B) errors (C) happiness (D) injury (E) fun", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. injury.\nExplanation: Playing any sport involves physical activity and movement, which can lead to injuries. Baseball involves throwing, catching, running, and sliding, all of which can result in injuries such as sprains, strains, and fractures. Therefore, the risk of injury is always present in baseball, just like in any other sport."}}
{"Q": "If I want to watch a movie without leaving my home what might I use?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) drive in movie (B) drive in movie (C) television (D) video store (E) show", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. television.\nExplanation: If you want to watch a movie without leaving your home, the most plausible option would be to use a television. With the availability of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, you can easily access a wide range of movies from the comfort of your own home. A drive-in movie requires leaving your home and going to a specific location, while a video store is becoming increasingly rare in the age of digital streaming. A show could refer to a live performance or a TV show, but neither of those options would necessarily allow you to watch a movie without leaving your home."}}
{"Q": "The victim was to take stand today, they were going to do what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) testify (B) runaway (C) witness (D) tell truth (E) go home", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. testify.\nExplanation: When a victim takes the stand, it means they are going to testify in court. Testifying is the act of giving evidence or making a statement in a legal case. It is an important part of the legal process and helps to establish the facts of the case. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What does a successful dog grooming session likely to make a owner feel?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cleanliness (B) mistakes (C) growth (D) satisfaction (E) late", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: A successful dog grooming session is likely to make an owner feel satisfied. The dog will look and smell clean, and the owner will feel good about taking care of their pet's hygiene needs. Mistakes or being late would not contribute to a successful grooming session, and while growth may be a positive outcome, it is not necessarily the primary feeling an owner would experience after grooming their dog."}}
{"Q": "The runner was in third place, but he pushed harder and thought he might be able to reach second.  What was beginning to do?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) near finish line (B) finish (C) get tired (D) gain ground (E) trip over", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. gain ground.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the runner was in third place but pushed harder, indicating that he was trying to catch up to the person in second place. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that he was trying to gain ground on the person in front of him. The other options (A) near finish line, (B) finish, (C) get tired, and (E) trip over are not supported by the information given in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "The tourist entered Mammoth cave, what state were they in?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) west virginia (B) kentucky (C) rocky hills (D) scotland (E) canyon", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Kentucky.\nExplanation: Mammoth Cave is located in Kentucky and is the world's longest known cave system, with over 400 miles of explored passageways. West Virginia, Rocky Hills, Scotland, and Canyon are not associated with Mammoth Cave."}}
{"Q": "What does someone typically feel when applying for a job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) horror (B) anxiety and fear (C) rejection (D) increased workload (E) being employed", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. anxiety and fear\nExplanation: Applying for a job can be a stressful experience, as it involves putting oneself out there and potentially facing rejection. It is common for individuals to feel anxious and fearful about the outcome of their application, as they may be worried about not being qualified enough or not standing out among other applicants."}}
{"Q": "He was on trial for obstructing justice, during which he made a questionable comment and was also found guilty of what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) prosecution (B) getting hurt (C) sweat (D) steam (E) committing perjury", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The fact that he made a questionable comment during the trial suggests that he may have lied under oath, which is known as perjury. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E, committing perjury. The other options, such as prosecution, getting hurt, sweat, and steam, do not make sense in the context of obstructing justice and making a questionable comment during a trial."}}
{"Q": "What kind of feelings does buying presents for others create?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) tears (B) please (C) like (D) thank (E) make happy", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Buying presents for others typically creates feelings of happiness, as it is a way to show love and appreciation for the recipient. While tears or gratitude may also be present, the most common emotion associated with gift-giving is happiness."}}
{"Q": "What green area is a marmot likely to be found in?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) countryside (B) great plains (C) encyclopedia (D) jungle (E) north america", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. countryside\nExplanation: Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions and open grassy areas, which are commonly found in the countryside. They are not typically found in the great plains or jungle, and while they are found in North America, this answer is too broad. The encyclopedia is not a green area where animals would be found. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A. countryside."}}
{"Q": "Jan tested the current, and noticed that it was high.  He thought that the wires might have too much what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) later (B) updated (C) still (D) resistance (E) now", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Jan noticed that the current was high, which could indicate that there is too much resistance in the wires. Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electric current, so if there is too much resistance, the current will be impeded and may not flow as well as it should. Therefore, option D, resistance, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What does a kindergarten teacher do before nap time?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) lower expectations (B) encourage (C) fear (D) time test (E) tell story", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. tell story\nExplanation: Kindergarten teachers often read or tell stories to their students before nap time to help them relax and wind down. This can also be a calming and enjoyable activity for the children, making it easier for them to transition into nap time. Lowering expectations or instilling fear would not be appropriate or effective strategies for preparing young children for nap time. Time testing would also not be a relevant activity before nap time. Encouragement may be helpful in other contexts, but may not be as effective in preparing children for nap time."}}
{"Q": "Sam was a stranger.  Even so, Mark treated him like what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) friend (B) family (C) known person (D) park (E) outsider", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Mark treated Sam like a friend, despite him being a stranger. This suggests that Mark is a friendly and welcoming person who is open to meeting new people."}}
{"Q": "Bob's only light source was a small bulb.  There were four walls, if there was a door he couldn't see it.  What was Bob in?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) closed room (B) sky (C) dard (D) his grave (E) house", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. closed room.\nExplanation: Based on the information given, Bob is in a closed room with no visible door and only a small bulb as a light source. The other options (sky, dark, his grave) do not fit the description given. While Bob could potentially be in a house, the more specific answer of a closed room is a better fit based on the details provided."}}
{"Q": "James thought of criminal justice like a computer program.  It need to work right.   What ideas might James not like?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) manual (B) process information (C) power down (D) control model (E) reason exists", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) manual\nExplanation: James views criminal justice as a system that needs to work efficiently and effectively, like a computer program. Therefore, he may not like the idea of manual processes, which can be slow and prone to errors. Instead, he would likely prefer automated processes that can process information quickly and accurately, such as a control model."}}
{"Q": "With the card slot lit up he knew how to get started finding his balance with what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) slot machine (B) ticket machine (C) bank machine (D) telephone (E) automated teller", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. automated teller\nExplanation: The phrase \"card slot\" suggests that the device being referred to is an ATM or automated teller machine. The protagonist is likely trying to access his bank account to check his balance, so the most plausible answer is E. automated teller."}}
{"Q": "To play sports professionally you must do what very often?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) wash your clothes (B) get in shape (C) practice (D) take off uniform (E) stretch", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. practice.\nExplanation: To play sports professionally, one must practice regularly to improve their skills, technique, and physical abilities. Practice helps athletes to develop muscle memory, endurance, and mental toughness, which are essential for success in sports. While washing clothes, getting in shape, stretching, and taking off uniforms are all important aspects of being a professional athlete, none of them are as crucial as consistent and focused practice."}}
{"Q": "Some people prefer releasing energy through work while others prefer to release it through what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) motion (B) stretch (C) exercise (D) movement (E) muscles", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Some people prefer to release their energy through motion, such as dancing or running, rather than through work or exercise. This allows them to move their body freely and release any pent-up energy or stress. Stretching and movement can also be effective ways to release energy, but motion is a more general and inclusive term that encompasses a wider range of activities. Muscles are involved in all of these activities, but they are not necessarily the primary focus of energy release."}}
{"Q": "What will a person going for a jog likely be wearing?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) grope (B) acknowledgment (C) comfortable clothes (D) ipod (E) passionate kisses", "R": {"text": "Answer: Comfortable clothes.\nExplanation: When going for a jog, it is important to wear comfortable clothes that allow for ease of movement and breathability. This may include athletic shorts or leggings, a moisture-wicking shirt, and supportive sneakers. The other options listed, such as \"grope,\" \"acknowledgment,\" \"ipod,\" and \"passionate kisses,\" are not relevant or appropriate for a person going for a jog."}}
{"Q": "The child pretended he was reading newspaper, he couldn't actually do it without what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) patience (B) falling down (C) literacy (D) buying (E) knowing how to read", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. knowing how to read.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the child pretended to read the newspaper, which means he did not actually know how to read. Therefore, the correct answer is knowing how to read. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Jenny enjoyed helping people.  It brought her a great deal of what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) satisfaction (B) complications (C) train (D) feel good about yourself (E) enjoyment", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence states that Jenny enjoyed helping people, which implies that it brought her a positive feeling. The most plausible answer from the choices is satisfaction, as it is a common feeling associated with helping others."}}
{"Q": "What might someone believe in if they are cleaning clothes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) feminism (B) sanitation (C) ruined (D) wrinkles (E) buttons to fall off", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Sanitation.\nExplanation: When someone is cleaning clothes, it is likely that they believe in the importance of keeping things clean and hygienic. Sanitation is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the act of cleaning clothes. Feminism, ruined, wrinkles, and buttons falling off do not have a direct connection to cleaning clothes."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a basement that can be accessed with an elevator?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) eat cake (B) closet (C) church (D) office building (E) own house", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. office building\nExplanation: It is common for office buildings to have basements that can be accessed with an elevator for storage or parking purposes. The other options, such as eating cake, a closet, a church, or one's own house, do not typically have basements that can be accessed with an elevator."}}
{"Q": "In order to learn to program from another person you can do what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) learn how to (B) have a friend (C) knowledge (D) take class (E) have computer", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. take class\nExplanation: Taking a class is a more structured and formal way of learning programming from another person. It allows for a dedicated time and space for learning, as well as access to a knowledgeable instructor who can provide guidance and answer questions. While having a friend or computer can be helpful, they may not necessarily have the expertise or resources to effectively teach programming. Similarly, simply having knowledge or trying to learn on your own may not provide the same level of support and feedback as taking a class."}}
{"Q": "He was at the gym trying to build muscle, what is it called that he is trying to build muscle on?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) body of animal (B) arm (C) bodybuilder (D) body of dog (E) human body", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. human body\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"he\" is at the gym trying to build muscle, which implies that he is a human being. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E. human body. The other options, such as body of animal, body of dog, or bodybuilder, do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What part of plants is pretty?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) dirt (B) no neurons in (C) millions of cells (D) flowers on (E) roots", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) flowers on\nExplanation: Flowers are the reproductive structures of plants and are often brightly colored and visually appealing, making them a common choice for decoration and landscaping. Dirt and roots are not typically considered pretty, and while plants do have millions of cells, this is not necessarily a visually striking feature. The statement \"no neurons in\" is not a complete sentence and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The man was going fishing instead of work, what is he seeking?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) food (B) relaxation (C) killing (D) missing morning cartoons (E) boredom", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. relaxation\nExplanation: The man is choosing to go fishing instead of going to work, which suggests that he is seeking some form of relaxation or leisure activity. Fishing is often seen as a calming and peaceful activity, which could be what the man is looking for. The other options, such as seeking food or killing, do not seem as likely based on the information given."}}
{"Q": "What could you get an unsmooth pit from?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) backyard (B) rock (C) mine (D) cherry (E) peach", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. peach\nExplanation: Peach pits are known to have a rough, unsmooth texture on the outside. Backyards and rocks are unlikely to produce pits, and while mines may have rough materials, it is not common to find pits in them. Cherry pits are typically smooth and hard, unlike the unsmooth texture described in the question. Therefore, peach is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man tried to reply to the woman, but he had difficulty keeping track of conversations that he didn't do what to?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) initiate (B) ignore (C) question (D) answer (E) ask", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the man had difficulty keeping track of conversations, which implies that he was struggling to follow the woman's words. Therefore, it would make sense that he would ask her to repeat or clarify what she said, rather than initiating a new conversation, ignoring her, questioning her, or answering a question she didn't ask. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (E) ask."}}
{"Q": "I couldn't find anybody who recalled the event, what were they adroit at doing?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) question authority (B) act fool (C) wash dishes (D) act innocent (E) forget", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. wash dishes.\nExplanation: The question states that nobody could recall the event, so it is unlikely that they were adroit at questioning authority or acting foolish. Forgetting is also a possibility, but it is not a skill or action. Acting innocent does not require adroitness. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C, as being adroit at washing dishes is a skill that could easily be forgotten or overlooked."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a large dining room containing a fancy chandelier?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) mansion (B) every house (C) own home (D) table (E) restaurant", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. mansion\nExplanation: A large dining room with a fancy chandelier is more commonly found in a mansion or a grand estate rather than in every house or one's own home. It is also possible to find such a dining room in a high-end restaurant, but the most plausible answer is a mansion."}}
{"Q": "The extremely large cargo plane could only land at a specialized runway, these were only located at a what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) back yard (B) bowling alley (C) city (D) military base (E) fashion show", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. military base.\nExplanation: Military bases often have specialized runways that can accommodate large cargo planes due to their need for transportation of military equipment and supplies. Backyards, bowling alleys, cities, and fashion shows are not suitable locations for such runways."}}
{"Q": "The carpet was smelly and discouraged the league from playing there, where was this smelly carpet installed?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bedroom (B) movie theater (C) bowling alley (D) church (E) office", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. bowling alley\nExplanation: A bowling alley is a place where a league would play, and it is common for bowling alleys to have carpeting. If the carpet was smelly, it would discourage the league from playing there. The other options (bedroom, movie theater, church, office) are less likely to have a league playing there and may not have carpeting at all."}}
{"Q": "How can someone be let into a brownstone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) brooklyn (B) ring (C) subdivision (D) bricks (E) new york city", "R": {"text": "Answer: Ring.\nExplanation: Brownstones typically have a doorbell or intercom system, so the most plausible way for someone to be let into a brownstone would be to ring the doorbell or call the resident to be buzzed in."}}
{"Q": "Where would someone purchase an upright piano?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) music class (B) college (C) music store (D) music room (E) music band", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. music store\nExplanation: A music store is a more plausible option for purchasing an upright piano as they specialize in selling musical instruments and equipment. Music classes, colleges, music rooms, and music bands may have pianos for use, but they are not typically in the business of selling them."}}
{"Q": "Where would you keep an ottoman near your front door?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) living room (B) parlor (C) furniture store (D) basement (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. living room\nExplanation: Ottomans are typically used as a footrest or extra seating in a living room. It would be more plausible to keep an ottoman near your front door in the living room for guests to sit on or to put on and take off shoes. Keeping it in a parlor or furniture store would be less likely, while keeping it in a basement or kitchen would be impractical."}}
{"Q": "Diving into backyard pools can be very dangerous and can lead to serious head and what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) going somewhere (B) splats (C) cancer (D) getting wet (E) spinal injuries", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Diving into backyard pools can lead to serious spinal injuries if the depth of the pool is not sufficient or if the diver hits their head on the bottom of the pool.

Pet store.\nExplanation: A snake in a cage is most likely to be found in a pet store, where they are kept as pets and sold to customers. While snakes can be found in the other locations listed, it is less likely that they would be in a cage in those environments."}}
{"Q": "Where are people likely to become impatient?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) end of line (B) buildings (C) apartment (D) neighbor's house (E) address", "R": {"text": "Answer: End of line.\nExplanation: People are likely to become impatient at the end of a line, such as a checkout line at a store or a line for a popular attraction. This is because they have been waiting for a period of time and are eager to complete their task or move on to the next activity. In contrast, buildings, apartments, neighbor's houses, and addresses do not necessarily elicit impatience in people."}}
{"Q": "When you fail to finish something, you failed at doing what to it", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) winning (B) passing (C) completing (D) do well (E) succeeding", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. completing\nExplanation: When you fail to finish something, it means you were not able to complete it.

{"Q": "John didn't care about style.  He felt that form was less important than what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) shapeless (B) quality (C) function (D) change shape (E) chaos", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: John believed that function was more important than style or form.

While enjoying the story and passing time may also be factors, the ultimate goal is to have fun and create a memorable experience with friends."}}
{"Q": "A supermarket is uncommon in what type of collection of shops?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) strip mall (B) city or town (C) shoppingcentre (D) boutique (E) vermont", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. boutique\nExplanation: A boutique is a small, specialized shop that typically sells high-end or unique items. Supermarkets are not typically found in this type of collection of shops, as they focus on a specific niche market rather than offering a wide range of everyday goods. Strip malls, city or town centers, and shopping centers are all more likely to have supermarkets as anchor stores. Vermont is not a type of collection of shops, but rather a state in the United States."}}
{"Q": "Bill puts meat on the scale, where does Bill work?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) music store (B) assay office (C) tidal wave (D) butcher shop (E) bathroom", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Bill works at a butcher shop, as putting meat on a scale is a common task in that type of establishment. The other options (music store, assay office, tidal wave, bathroom) do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "I'm having some food at my party, what will I need to serve it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) zoo (B) pan (C) bowl (D) kitchen (E) spoon", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: To serve food at a party, one would typically need bowls to hold and distribute the food. A zoo, pan, kitchen, or spoon would not be necessary or practical for serving food to guests."}}
{"Q": "Before racers start to run they must do what at the starting line?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) learn to walk (B) walking (C) walk slowly (D) breathe (E) stand still", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. stand still.\nExplanation: Before racers start to run, they must stand still at the starting line to prepare themselves mentally and physically for the race. This helps them to focus on the race and get ready to run as soon as the starting signal is given. Walking, walking slowly, learning to walk, or breathing are not necessary actions that racers need to do at the starting line."}}
{"Q": "What does an actor do when they are bored of their roles?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) mask (B) branch out (C) wear costume (D) pretend (E) sing songs", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Branch out.\nExplanation: When an actor gets bored of their roles, they often try to branch out and explore different types of characters or genres. This can help them avoid getting typecast and keep their career fresh and exciting. They may also take on new challenges, such as directing or producing, to keep themselves engaged in the industry. Masking, wearing costumes, pretending, and singing songs may be part of an actor's job, but they are not necessarily solutions to boredom with their roles."}}
{"Q": "What is a person called who doesn't have immortality?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) mortal (B) dying (C) death (D) dead (E) mortal", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. mortal\nExplanation: Mortal refers to a living being that is subject to death and does not possess immortality. It is the most appropriate choice among the given options. Dying, death, and dead all refer to the state of being deceased, while mortal refers to the nature of being alive and susceptible to death."}}
{"Q": "Why would you be watching tv instead of doing something else?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) headache (B) laughter (C) laziness (D) erections (E) wasting time", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) laughter\nExplanation: Watching TV can be a form of entertainment and relaxation. If someone is watching a comedy show or a funny movie, they may be laughing and enjoying themselves, which can be a positive experience. Laughter has been shown to have health benefits such as reducing stress and boosting the immune system. Therefore, it is a more plausible reason for watching TV than options like laziness or wasting time."}}
{"Q": "If chewing food is difficult for you, what is a possible reason?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) broken jaw (B) sore mouth (C) eating (D) good digestion (E) avoiding choking", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. sore mouth\nExplanation: If chewing food is difficult, it could be due to a sore mouth caused by dental problems, mouth ulcers, or other oral health issues. A broken jaw (A) would likely make it impossible to chew at all, while good digestion (D) and avoiding choking (E) are not related to the act of chewing itself. Eating (C) is not a reason for difficulty in chewing, but rather the activity that is affected by the difficulty."}}
{"Q": "He had to wear a tuxedo while playing the keyboard instrument, so did the other hundred members of the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) music store (B) band (C) medium (D) orchestra (E) piano store", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The mention of a keyboard instrument and the requirement of wearing a tuxedo suggests a formal musical performance, which is typically associated with an orchestra rather than a music store, piano store, or medium. A band could also require formal attire, but the mention of \"other hundred members\" suggests a larger group, which is more commonly associated with an orchestra."}}
{"Q": "Where do you find the most amount of leafs?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) floral arrangement (B) ground (C) forrest (D) field (E) compost pile", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. forest\nExplanation: The forest is a natural habitat for trees, and trees are the primary source of leaves. Therefore, it is more plausible to find the most amount of leaves in a forest rather than in a floral arrangement, on the ground, in a field, or in a compost pile."}}
{"Q": "Where can children play with animals?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) meadow (B) play room (C) surface of earth (D) zoos (E) fairgrounds", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Zoos.\nExplanation: Zoos are specifically designed to provide a safe and controlled environment for children to interact with animals. They offer a variety of exhibits and activities that allow children to observe and learn about different species, as well as opportunities to feed and pet certain animals under the supervision of trained professionals. While meadows and fairgrounds may offer some opportunities for animal interaction, they are not as safe or regulated as zoos. Play rooms and the surface of the earth are not appropriate places for children to play with animals as they may pose safety risks or harm to both the children and the animals."}}
{"Q": "What kind of tale might feature a talking weasel?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) mulberry bush (B) animated film (C) chicken coop (D) history book (E) children's story", "R": {"text": "Answer: Children's story.\nExplanation: Talking animals are a common feature in children's stories, and a weasel could easily be included in a tale about a group of animal friends or a mischievous character. The talking weasel could provide humor or serve as a foil to the protagonist."}}
{"Q": "What kind of status is the bald eagle given?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) outside (B) world (C) protection (D) colorado (E) america", "R": {"text": "Answer: (C) protection\nExplanation: The bald eagle is given protection status in America under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. This act prohibits the killing, selling, or possession of bald eagles and their parts, as well as the disturbance of their nests or eggs. The bald eagle is considered a symbol of freedom and strength in America and is protected to ensure its survival."}}
{"Q": "Why do most people take a quick rest during the day?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) need to (B) hungry (C) feel more energetic (D) weak (E) regenerate", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: Most people take a quick rest during the day to feel more energetic. Taking a short break can help to recharge the body and mind, allowing individuals to be more productive and focused when they return to their tasks. It can also help to prevent burnout and fatigue, which can lead to decreased productivity and overall well-being."}}
{"Q": "What could suddenly stop someone when he or she is running?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) mushroom (B) falling down (C) sweating (D) exhaustion (E) getting tired", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) exhaustion.\nExplanation: When someone is running, they are expending a lot of energy. If they continue to run without taking a break, they may become exhausted and unable to continue running. This is a common reason why someone may suddenly stop while running. Mushrooms and sweating are not likely to cause someone to suddenly stop while running, and getting tired is a gradual process that would not cause a sudden stop. Falling down could cause someone to stop, but it is not as likely as exhaustion."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a monkey in the wild?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) zoo (B) barrel (C) research laboratory (D) captivity (E) thailand", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. Thailand\nExplanation: Monkeys are found in the wild in various parts of the world, including Asia, Africa, and South America. Thailand is known for its diverse wildlife, including several species of monkeys such as macaques and langurs. While monkeys can also be found in zoos, research laboratories, and captivity, the most likely place to find them in their natural habitat is in the wild. Therefore, option E is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where could a sloth live?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) tropical jungle (B) manual (C) work (D) transit (E) countryside", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. tropical jungle\nExplanation: Sloths are arboreal animals that are native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. They are adapted to living in trees and spend most of their time hanging upside down from branches. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (A) tropical jungle. The other options, such as manual, work, transit, and countryside, are not suitable habitats for sloths."}}
{"Q": "A gentleman is carrying equipment for golf, what is he likely to have?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) club (B) assembly hall (C) meditation center (D) meeting (E) church", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. club\nExplanation: A gentleman carrying equipment for golf is likely to have clubs, as they are essential for playing the sport. An assembly hall, meditation center, meeting, or church would not be relevant to golf equipment."}}
{"Q": "If you have a home with a courtyard, what's one thing you probably don't have to care for any longer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) lawn (B) kids (C) asshole (D) spain (E) office complex", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. lawn\nExplanation: A courtyard typically does not have a large enough area to accommodate a lawn, so homeowners with courtyards do not have to worry about mowing, watering, or maintaining a lawn. Instead, they can focus on caring for plants, flowers, and other decorative elements in the courtyard."}}
{"Q": "The computer was difficult for he to understand at the store, so what did she sign up for to learn more?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) classroom (B) facebook (C) school (D) apartment (E) demonstration", "R": {"text": "Answer: Classroom.\nExplanation: Since the sentence mentions that the computer was difficult for her to understand at the store, it implies that she needs more guidance and instruction to learn about computers. Therefore, signing up for a classroom course would be a more plausible option than Facebook or apartment. School could also be a possibility, but it is not specified what level of education she is seeking. A demonstration could be helpful, but it may not provide enough in-depth knowledge for her to fully understand the computer."}}
{"Q": "If you take the risk buying a used car, you still hope it can what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) go fast (B) start running (C) going too fast (D) look good (E) last several years", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: When buying a used car, the hope is that it will last several years without major issues. While going fast or looking good may be desirable, the primary concern is the car's reliability and longevity. Starting to run is also important, but it is assumed that a used car will at least start running initially. Therefore, option E is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Dan was ditting quietly on the couch with a book in his hand.  Laurie thought that he was just focused on what he was doing, but he actually did what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) eat (B) think (C) reading (D) meditate (E) fall asleep", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. reading\nExplanation: The sentence states that Dan was sitting quietly on the couch with a book in his hand, indicating that he was likely reading. The other options (eating, thinking, meditating, falling asleep) do not fit with the context provided in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What is the primary purpose of cars?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cost money (B) slow down (C) move people (D) turn right (E) get girls", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. move people\nExplanation: The primary purpose of cars is to transport people from one place to another. While cars do cost money, they are not primarily designed for that purpose. Similarly, cars can slow down, turn right, and attract attention from girls, but these are not their primary functions."}}
{"Q": "Alabama is full of different people, but they are all citizens of what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) united states (B) deep south (C) floribama (D) gulf states (E) florabama", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Alabama is a state within the United States, so all of its citizens are citizens of the United States. The other options, such as \"Deep South\" and \"Floribama,\" are regional or colloquial terms that do not accurately describe the citizenship status of Alabama residents. \"Gulf States\" is a broader term that includes Alabama, but it still does not specify citizenship."}}
{"Q": "They were hoping their campaign would create a rise in awareness of the problem and hopefully do what to its effect?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) set (B) fall (C) park (D) descend (E) reduce", "R": {"text": "Answer: (E) reduce\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the campaign was aimed at increasing awareness of a problem. Therefore, the desired effect of the campaign would be to reduce the problem, not increase it. Option (A) \"set\" and option (D) \"descend\" both imply a decrease, but they are less likely to be used in this context. Option (B) \"fall\" could also work, but \"reduce\" is a more precise and common verb to use in this context. Option (C) \"park\" is completely unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "What do airplanes do as they are arriving at the gate?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) slow down (B) crash (C) speed up (D) land (E) carry people", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. slow down\nExplanation: As airplanes approach the gate, they need to slow down in order to safely come to a stop and allow passengers to disembark. Speeding up or crashing would obviously be dangerous and landing would have already occurred before reaching the gate. Carrying people is what airplanes are designed to do, but it is not specific to the action of arriving at the gate."}}
{"Q": "If a person with mental illness stops treatment what will likely happen?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) managed (B) dancing (C) recur (D) effectively treated (E) cause suffering", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. recur\nExplanation: If a person with mental illness stops treatment, there is a high likelihood that their symptoms will recur or worsen. Mental illness is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management and treatment. Without proper treatment, the person may experience a relapse of their symptoms, which can cause significant distress and impairment in their daily life. It is important for individuals with mental illness to continue treatment as prescribed by their healthcare provider to effectively manage their condition."}}
{"Q": "The gimmicky low brow TV show was about animals when they what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) sick (B) mammals (C) males (D) bite (E) attack", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. mammals\nExplanation: The word \"animals\" is a broad term that can refer to any living organism that is not a plant. However, the word \"mammals\" is more specific and refers to a specific group of animals that have certain characteristics, such as giving birth to live young and producing milk for their offspring. It is more plausible that a TV show about animals would focus on a specific group, such as mammals, rather than a vague concept like \"when they attack\" or \"when they bite.\" Additionally, the use of the word \"gimmicky\" suggests that the show may have relied on a specific hook or gimmick, such as focusing on a particular type of animal."}}
{"Q": "A loud machine is irritating, but many are expected where?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) museum (B) house (C) laboratory (D) library (E) industrial area", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: A loud machine is expected in an industrial area where heavy machinery and equipment are used for manufacturing and production purposes. It would be out of place and disruptive in a museum, house, laboratory, or library where quiet and peaceful environments are necessary."}}
{"Q": "What part of a table would you put a ruler in?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) drawer (B) desk (C) the backside (D) office (E) measure distance", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. Measure distance.\nExplanation: A ruler is a tool used to measure distance, so it would not be placed in a drawer, on a desk, or in an office. The backside of a table is also an unlikely place to store a ruler. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the ruler would be used to measure distance on the table itself."}}
{"Q": "What happens if someone kisses too long?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) strong feelings (B) herpes (C) shortness of breath (D) excitement (E) arousal", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. shortness of breath.\nExplanation: Prolonged kissing can lead to a decrease in oxygen intake, which can cause shortness of breath. This is especially true if the kissing is intense and involves a lot of tongue action. While strong feelings, excitement, and arousal can also be a result of prolonged kissing, herpes is a sexually transmitted infection that can be transmitted through kissing, but it is not a direct result of kissing too long."}}
{"Q": "If I have a modern light source in my living room, what is it likely to be?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sky (B) house (C) lamp (D) match (E) candle", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. lamp.\nExplanation: A modern light source in a living room is most likely to be a lamp, as it is a common household item used for lighting. The other options, such as the sky, house, match, and candle, are not typically used as light sources in a living room setting."}}
{"Q": "The person saw the mess his children made, what was his following reaction?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) smell smoke (B) cross street (C) cry (D) bank savings (E) look angry", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Seeing the mess his children made, it is more plausible that the person would look angry as it is a natural reaction to seeing a mess that needs to be cleaned up. Smelling smoke, crossing the street, crying, or banking savings do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Who might wear dark glasses indoors?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) blind person (B) glove box (C) movie studio (D) ray charles (E) glove compartment", "R": {"text": "Answer: A blind person.\nExplanation: A blind person may wear dark glasses indoors as a form of protection from bright lights or to help them navigate their surroundings. The dark glasses can also help reduce glare and provide some level of privacy."}}
{"Q": "Where would stones not be arranged in a path?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) quarries (B) field (C) park (D) bridge (E) made from rocks", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. quarries\nExplanation: Stones in quarries are typically left in their natural state and not arranged in a path. Quarries are places where stones are extracted from the earth, so it would not make sense to arrange them in a path. In contrast, stones in fields, parks, bridges, and even those made from rocks can be arranged in a path for various purposes such as decoration, landscaping, or providing a walkway."}}
{"Q": "A bald eagle is likely to be found on what kind of work?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) rural area (B) book (C) canada (D) painting (E) aviary", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. rural area\nExplanation: Bald eagles are known to inhabit areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and coastlines. These areas are often found in rural or wilderness areas, where the eagles can hunt for fish and other prey without disturbance from human activity. While bald eagles may be depicted in books or paintings, and may be found in aviaries, they are most commonly associated with natural habitats in rural areas. While Canada is a known habitat for bald eagles, it is not the only place they can be found."}}
{"Q": "The hostess was good at her job, she always had a smile when she would what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) group people (B) ready parlor for guests (C) welcome guests (D) work room (E) park", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. welcome guests.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the hostess was good at her job and always had a smile, which suggests that her job involved interacting with guests. Option C, welcoming guests, is the most likely job responsibility that would require a hostess to greet guests with a smile. The other options, such as grouping people or working in a room, do not necessarily require a friendly demeanor. Option B, readying the parlor for guests, could involve some interaction with guests, but it is less likely to be the primary responsibility of a hostess. Option E, park, is completely unrelated to the job of a hostess."}}
{"Q": "What is likely to happen to someone who is learning?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) overconfidence (B) effectiveness (C) knowing more (D) head grows larger (E) growth", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. growth.\nExplanation: Learning is a process of acquiring new knowledge, skills, and abilities. As someone learns, they are likely to experience growth in their understanding and abilities. This growth may be in the form of increased knowledge, improved problem-solving skills, or enhanced creativity. Overconfidence may occur in some cases, but it is not a necessary outcome of learning. Effectiveness and knowing more are also possible outcomes of learning, but they are not as general as growth. Finally, the head does not grow larger as a result of learning."}}
{"Q": "The inspector was agreeing with the factory protocols, what was the status of the factory?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) compliance (B) eligible (C) contract (D) harmony (E) friendship", "R": {"text": "Answer: Compliance.\nExplanation: The word \"protocols\" suggests that there are rules and regulations in place that the factory must follow. The fact that the inspector is agreeing with these protocols indicates that the factory is in compliance with them. Therefore, option (A) compliance is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "After standing up I had to sit right back down, why would I feel like this?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) train (B) effort (C) balance (D) feet (E) muscles", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. balance\nExplanation: Feeling like you need to sit back down after standing up could be a sign of balance issues. It could be due to inner ear problems, neurological conditions, or simply a lack of strength in the muscles that help you maintain balance. It is important to consult a doctor if this feeling persists or is accompanied by other symptoms."}}
{"Q": "Where do you go on a night out before going to the bar?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) new york city (B) las vegas (C) restaurant (D) nightclub (E) park", "R": {"text": "Answer: Restaurant.\nExplanation: It is common to go to a restaurant for dinner or drinks before heading to a bar for a night out. This allows for socializing and getting in the mood for the rest of the evening. While New York City and Las Vegas are popular nightlife destinations, they do not necessarily answer the question of where to go before the bar. Nightclubs may be too loud and crowded for pre-bar activities, and parks are not typically associated with nightlife. Therefore, the most plausible answer is a restaurant."}}
{"Q": "The dad wanted to protect his house, where did he put his gun?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) police station (B) crime scene (C) restroom (D) drawer (E) holster", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. drawer\nExplanation: It is common for people to keep their guns in a secure location within their own home, such as a locked drawer or safe, in order to protect their family and property. The other options, such as the police station or crime scene, do not make sense in this context. The restroom or holster may also be options, but the drawer is a more likely choice for long-term storage."}}
{"Q": "What instrument can be played with an air of happiness?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) jump up and down (B) jump up and down (C) sing (D) play games (E) fiddle", "R": {"text": "Answer: Sing.\nExplanation: Singing is often associated with happiness and joy. It can express emotions and bring people together in a positive way. While jumping up and down and playing games can also be fun, they may not necessarily convey a sense of happiness in the same way that singing can. The fiddle can be played in a happy manner, but it is not the only instrument that can convey happiness."}}
{"Q": "What to kids do for boredom on a ramp?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) watch film (B) fire game (C) hang out at bar (D) go skiing (E) skateboard", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. Skateboard.\nExplanation: Kids often use ramps for skateboarding, so it is the most plausible answer for what they would do for boredom on a ramp. Watching a film or hanging out at a bar are not appropriate activities for children, and a fire game or skiing would not be possible on a ramp."}}
{"Q": "What animal has quills all over it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) feather (B) chicken (C) calligraphy (D) porcupine (E) hedgehog", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Both porcupines and hedgehogs have quills all over their bodies, but hedgehogs are more commonly known for their quills and are often kept as pets. Feathers are not quills, and chickens and calligraphy have nothing to do with quills or animals."}}
{"Q": "Why would you go to an office?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) work (B) school building (C) paper (D) city (E) habit", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. work\nExplanation: Offices are typically associated with places of work, where people go to perform their job duties and responsibilities.

Without saving any money, you will have nothing to fall back on in case of emergencies or unexpected expenses. Eventually, you will run out of money and be unable to continue buying things."}}
{"Q": "Though a mouse might prefer your house, you might also see him where?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) tin (B) department store (C) garden (D) small hole (E) cupboard", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: A mouse is a common sight in gardens, especially if there are plants and trees around. They can hide in the bushes or under the soil, and they may also be attracted to bird feeders or other sources of food. While they may also be found in other places like tin cans or cupboards, a garden is a more plausible answer as it is a natural habitat for mice."}}

Therefore, the most plausible answer is (A) head north. The other choices, such as speed up, go fast, and headed south, do not accurately reflect the car's goal of traveling to New York."}}

While some animals may be kept in zoos, this is not where all animals live. The moon and fairgrounds are not suitable habitats for animals to live in. The meadow is a possible habitat for some animals, but not all animals live in meadows. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that animals live on the surface of the earth."}}

While a dining room table can also be large, it is not typically referred to as \"very large.\" A kitchen table is usually smaller and meant for more casual dining. \"In a lake\" and \"demonstration\" are not plausible options for a very large table."}}

He treated it like it was what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) candy (B) death and (C) free money (D) discount (E) credit", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. free money.\nExplanation: Tax refunds are essentially money that was overpaid to the government throughout the year and is returned to the taxpayer. Therefore, it can feel like \"free money\" since it was unexpected and not budgeted for. While it's important to use tax refunds wisely, some people may treat it as extra spending money or a windfall."}}

{"Q": "The lady would eat and eat, and because of mental issues would then make herself what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) wash dishes (B) throwing up (C) drinking (D) throw up (E) turn inside out", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. throwing up.\nExplanation: The lady's excessive eating followed by making herself throw up is a common symptom of bulimia, an eating disorder often associated with mental health issues. Washing dishes or drinking do not fit the pattern of this behavior, and \"turning inside out\" is not a realistic option."}}
{"Q": "A car was hailed to chauffeur someone to the opera house, where was it heading?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) go downtown (B) appear suddenly (C) go fast (D) bottom out (E) east", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. go downtown.\nExplanation: The context of the sentence suggests that the car was hailed to take someone to the opera house, which is typically located in a downtown area.

{"Q": "What do you go to see for live entertainment?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) movie (B) show (C) concert venue (D) casino (E) theatre", "R": {"text": "Answer: Show.\nExplanation: Shows typically refer to live performances such as plays, musicals, or comedy shows. These types of live entertainment offer a unique and immersive experience that cannot be replicated through a movie or casino.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) classroom. The other options, such as (A) bad mood, (B) hutch, and (D) pair of trousers, are not relevant to the context and do not make sense in relation to the teacher's statement. Option (E) year is also unlikely as it is too broad and does not provide any specific reason why a ferret may not make a good pet for an entire year."}}

A cage provides a controlled environment where the bird can eat, sleep, and play without the risk of escaping or being harmed by other animals. While some birds may be allowed to fly freely in a room or aviary, a cage is still necessary for their safety and comfort when they need to rest or sleep."}}

The other options, such as \"passing around\" or \"wellness,\" do not accurately describe the patient's condition after recovering from a disease. \"Cure\" could also be a possible answer, but it is less commonly used in everyday language compared to \"healthy.\""}}

{"Q": "After high tide, where on the coast can you look to find a sea anemone?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) nursery (B) museum (C) gulf of mexico (D) tide pool (E) intertidal zone", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Tide pool.\nExplanation: After high tide, the water level recedes and leaves behind pools of water in rocky areas along the coast. These pools are called tide pools and are home to various marine organisms, including sea anemones. Therefore, it is more plausible to find a sea anemone in a tide pool than in a nursery, museum, or the Gulf of Mexico. The intertidal zone is also a possible answer, but tide pools are a specific type of intertidal zone habitat where sea anemones are commonly found."}}
{"Q": "What could a driving car do to a pedestrian?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) say hello (B) wreak (C) pollution (D) smoke (E) relaxation", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. wreak\nExplanation: A driving car could potentially wreak havoc on a pedestrian if the driver is not paying attention or driving recklessly. This could result in serious injury or even death for the pedestrian. Pollution and smoke are also negative impacts of driving, but they do not directly affect the pedestrian in the same way as a potential collision. Saying hello or providing relaxation are not actions that a driving car could do to a pedestrian."}}

If you can't get out of the house you might decide to do what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) play cards (B) skateboard (C) meet interesting people (D) listen to music (E) go to a concert", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) play cards\nExplanation: Playing cards is a common indoor activity that can be done alone or with others.

{"Q": "What would you put meat on top of to cook it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) oil (B) freezer (C) ham sandwich (D) oven (E) frying pan", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. frying pan\nExplanation: Frying pans are commonly used to cook meat by placing it on top of the heated surface. Oil may be added to the pan to prevent sticking and enhance flavor, but it is not necessary. The freezer and ham sandwich options are not suitable for cooking meat, and while an oven can be used for certain types of meat, it typically involves placing the meat inside the oven rather than on top of it."}}
{"Q": "Minerals can be obtained in what way for a person who avoids leafy greens?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) multivitamin (B) farm (C) michigan (D) earth (E) ore", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If a person avoids leafy greens, they may not be getting enough minerals in their diet. One way to supplement their mineral intake is through a multivitamin, which contains a variety of essential minerals. While minerals can technically be obtained from the earth or ore, it is not a practical or safe way for a person to obtain them for consumption. A farm or Michigan (presumably referring to the state) are not relevant options for obtaining minerals."}}

Therefore, it is more plausible that you would be spending money a few hours after cashing in rather than being happy, receiving more money, getting paid, or selling out."}}
{"Q": "The smelly man was having a bath, but what is he pursuing?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) hydration (B) being clear (C) personal cleanliness (D) will drown (E) use of water", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. personal cleanliness.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the smelly man was having a bath, which implies that he is pursuing personal cleanliness. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Hydration and use of water are not relevant to the sentence, being clear is vague and does not fit the context, and the option of drowning is unlikely as the sentence mentions that he is having a bath, which implies that he is in control of the situation."}}
{"Q": "What might a couple have a lot of when they are deciding on stopping being married to each other?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) pleasure (B) detachment (C) exercise (D) bankruptcy (E) fights", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. fights\nExplanation: When a couple is considering divorce, it is likely that they have been having a lot of arguments and disagreements. This can be a major factor in their decision to end their marriage. While some couples may be able to detach from each other emotionally, it is unlikely that they would be experiencing pleasure or exercise during this difficult time. Bankruptcy may also be a factor in some divorces, but it is not necessarily a common one."}}
{"Q": "If a person is working a lot, what are they likely trying to earn?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) much money (B) own house (C) creativity (D) new car (E) caregiver", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. much money\nExplanation: If a person is working a lot, it is likely that they are trying to earn more money. Working long hours or multiple jobs is often done to increase income and financial stability.

The credit card perks would help offset these costs, making the business man glad. The other options (A) car, (B) theatre, (C) airport, and (E) Disneyland do not fit as well with the context of the sentence."}}

The other options, such as a motel room or nearest public restroom, may not provide the same level of comfort and familiarity as his own bathroom."}}
{"Q": "The forest experienced a cold winter, where is it located?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) earth (B) south america (C) amazon basin (D) temperate zone (E) national park", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. temperate zone\nExplanation: The temperate zone is known for experiencing cold winters, as opposed to tropical regions like South America and the Amazon Basin. The mention of a forest also suggests a location with trees and vegetation, which is common in temperate zones. The option of \"national park\" is too vague and could refer to any location, while \"earth\" is too broad and doesn't provide any specific information about the location."}}
{"Q": "How can you let someone know about your anger without hurting him or her?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) release energy (B) destroy enemy (C) punch (D) write letter (E) lose your temper", "R": {"text": "Answer: Write letter.\nExplanation: Writing a letter can be a good way to express your anger without hurting someone. It allows you to organize your thoughts and emotions, and gives the other person time to process what you are saying without feeling attacked in the moment. It also gives you the opportunity to choose your words carefully and avoid saying something hurtful that you may regret later."}}

It provides a stable surface for the phone and is easily accessible for use. Choosing options like a bar or party may not be appropriate as they are not stable surfaces and may not be appropriate for phone use. A friend's house or office may be suitable, but it depends on the context and situation."}}

{"Q": "How would you express information to a deaf person?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) summarize main points (B) close mouth (C) write down (D) may disagree (E) talk", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Summarize main points.\nExplanation: Summarizing main points is a more plausible answer as it allows the deaf person to understand the key information without overwhelming them with unnecessary details. This can be done through sign language or written communication. Simply closing the mouth or talking may not be effective as the deaf person may not be able to understand spoken language. Writing down information can also be helpful, but summarizing main points can be more efficient and easier to understand. It is important to note that the deaf person may disagree with the information presented, but this is not related to the method of communication used."}}

The other options, such as forest or car show, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The mention of humans in option D may be a clue, but it does not provide a clear answer as to what was polluted. Therefore, option C, air, is the most plausible answer."}}

This means that both parties should be clear about what is being discussed and what actions need to be taken. Misunderstandings, confusion, and silence can all hinder the transfer of information and lead to problems down the line. Learning can also be a goal of communication, but it should not be the primary focus when communicating with your boss."}}

While fish can be found in streams, it is not a guarantee and would require fishing equipment and knowledge of the area. Aquariums are also a possibility, but they are not typically used for obtaining fish for consumption. Refrigerators are used for storing fish, but they are not a location where fish can be found naturally. Boat rides may allow for fishing, but they do not guarantee the presence of fish. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E. market."}}
{"Q": "What are people likely to want to do with their friends?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) own land (B) own home (C) talk to each other (D) believe in god (E) spend time", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. spend time.\nExplanation: People are likely to want to spend time with their friends, whether it's going out to eat, watching a movie, playing sports, or just hanging out.

{"Q": "Where would you put a glass after drinking from it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) ocean (B) water cooler (C) cabinet (D) dishwasher (E) dining room", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. cabinet\nExplanation: Putting a glass in the ocean or water cooler would be inappropriate and potentially harmful to the environment. Putting it in the dishwasher would require washing it first, and putting it in the dining room would be too vague. Therefore, the most plausible answer is to put the glass in the cabinet, where it can be easily accessed for future use or washed if necessary."}}
{"Q": "Where would you buy food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) freezer (B) store (C) home (D) hatred (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "Answer: Store.\nExplanation: The most common and logical place to buy food is a store, where a variety of food items are available for purchase.

Washington D.C.\nExplanation: As the question states that Donald is a prominent figure for the federal government, it is likely that he spends a lot of time in the city where the federal government is located, which is Washington D.C. The other options, such as \"everything,\" \"tourist sites,\" and \"Canada,\" do not make sense in the context of the question. The Capitol Building is located in Washington D.C., so option B could also be a plausible answer, but it is more specific than the general location of Washington D.C."}}
{"Q": "There was more than one bum asking for change or a ticket, it was the cheapest way to travel so it was no surprise sight at the what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) train station (B) beach (C) bus depot (D) bridge (E) stumblebum", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. bus depot\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that asking for change or a ticket was the cheapest way to travel, which suggests that these individuals were likely trying to board a bus.

{"Q": "Joe owned back taxes as well as what other type of taxes?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) anterior (B) front (C) main (D) front (E) current", "R": {"text": "Answer: (E) current\nExplanation: The word \"back\" in \"back taxes\" implies that Joe owes taxes from a previous period. Therefore, the other type of taxes he owes would be current taxes, which are due for the current period. The other answer choices do not make sense in this context. \"Anterior\" means earlier in time, but it is not a commonly used term to describe taxes. \"Front\" and \"main\" do not have any specific meaning in relation to taxes."}}

{"Q": "What is the habitat of the fox?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) hen house (B) burrow (C) california (D) england (E) mountains", "R": {"text": "Answer: (E) mountains\nExplanation: Foxes are known to inhabit a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even urban areas. However, they are particularly well adapted to living in mountainous regions, where they can find shelter in rocky crevices and hunt for prey in the surrounding terrain. While foxes may occasionally raid a hen house for food, this is not their primary habitat. Similarly, while they may dig burrows for shelter, this is not exclusive to their habitat. California and England are both regions where foxes can be found, but they are not specific habitats."}}

We're better at doing what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) eat eggs (B) make tools (C) eat dosa (D) talk to each other (E) smoke pot", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. make tools.\nExplanation: While animals also use tools, humans have developed the ability to create and use a wide variety of tools for various purposes, giving us an advantage in survival and dominance over the planet. Eating eggs, eating dosa, and smoking pot are not unique to humans, and while communication is important, it is not exclusive to humans either. Therefore, making tools is the most plausible answer."}}

They couldn't hear him over the sound of the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) surface of earth (B) teardrops (C) snowflake (D) typhoon (E) motor", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that they couldn't hear him over the sound of the motor. Since Joe was thrown from his boat, it's likely that the boat was still running and the sound of the motor would have been loud enough to drown out his cries for help. The other options (surface of earth, teardrops, snowflake, and typhoon) don't make sense in this context and are unlikely to be loud enough to drown out someone's cries for help."}}

This process of growth and development continues throughout the lifespan of the organism until it reaches maturity. While death is an inevitable part of life, it does not happen immediately after birth. Similarly, reproduction may not occur until the organism reaches sexual maturity, which can take years. Sometimes bad is too vague and does not provide a clear answer. Therefore, the most plausible answer is growing older."}}

Ask question.\nExplanation: The most appropriate and polite way to get someone to repeat something they said is to simply ask them to repeat it.

Walking, thinking, writing in crayon, or sneezing are not effective ways to communicate that you missed something and need it repeated."}}
{"Q": "Where does one store fabric in their own home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sewing room (B) clothing store (C) tailor shop (D) clothes store (E) cotton mill", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. sewing room\nExplanation: Fabric is typically stored in a sewing room in one's own home, as this is where one would typically do sewing projects and have easy access to their fabric stash.

Having fun is also a possibility, but it is not a physical occurrence like sweating. Therefore, sweating is the most plausible answer."}}

A synagogue, bus stop, or building would not provide the necessary medical care. Going for help is a vague option and may not lead to immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C. hospital."}}
{"Q": "The cancer patient was expecting to die, so he made out his what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) not to live (B) write will (C) never want (D) seek help (E) go to hell", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. write will.\nExplanation: When someone is expecting to die, it is common for them to make a will, which is a legal document that outlines how their assets and possessions will be distributed after their death.

Connecticut.\nExplanation: The toll road that meandered from Maine to New Hampshire is likely the Maine Turnpike, which runs through Maine and connects to the New Hampshire Turnpike. Connecticut is a neighboring state to both Maine and New Hampshire, making it a more plausible answer than Massachusetts or New Jersey. My house is not a plausible answer as it is not a state or location."}}
{"Q": "If you partied all night you could find yourself already what, even when just beginning work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) getting tired (B) working (C) procrastination (D) jumping (E) sitting down", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. getting tired\nExplanation: If you partied all night, you would likely be exhausted and tired the next day, even when just beginning work. This could affect your productivity and ability to focus on tasks, making it difficult to get work done efficiently."}}
{"Q": "The cat carefully navigated the area, they do everything they can to avoid what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) get wet (B) eat vegetables (C) falling (D) wool sweater (E) sharp claws", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. falling.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the cat is being cautious and careful while navigating the area, which implies that there might be some obstacles or dangers around. Out of the given options, falling seems to be the most plausible one as it is a common danger for cats while climbing or jumping. The other options like getting wet, eating vegetables, or a wool sweater do not seem to pose any immediate danger to the cat, and sharp claws are a natural part of a cat's body that they use for various purposes."}}
{"Q": "What is someone usually doing if someone else is talking to him or her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) listening (B) language (C) looking at eyes (D) planning the perfect murder (E) voice", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. listening\nExplanation: When someone else is talking to us, we are usually expected to listen to what they are saying. This involves paying attention to their words, tone, and body language in order to understand their message. While language and voice are important factors in communication, they are not the only ones, and looking at someone's eyes can also be a sign of active listening. Planning the perfect murder is not a typical or appropriate response to someone talking to us."}}
{"Q": "What does the sky do before a rain?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) appear beautiful (B) appear blue (C) shows a rainbow (D) rain water (E) cloud over", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. cloud over\nExplanation: Before a rain, the sky usually becomes cloudy and overcast as the moisture in the air condenses and forms clouds. This is a common sign that rain is on its way. While rainbows can sometimes appear after a rain, they are not a reliable indicator of impending rain. The sky may appear beautiful or blue on a clear day, but this is not typically the case before a rain. And while rainwater obviously falls during a rain, it is not something that the sky itself does."}}
{"Q": "Pens, computers, text books and paper clips can all be found where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) desktop (B) university (C) drawer (D) table (E) work", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. drawer\nExplanation: Pens, computers, textbooks, and paper clips are all common office or school supplies that are typically stored in a drawer. While they may also be found on a desktop, table, or at work, the most likely place to find all of these items together is in a drawer where they can be easily organized and accessed. The option of \"university\" is too broad and does not necessarily guarantee the presence of all these items."}}
{"Q": "What geographic area is a lizard likely to be?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) ball stopped (B) west texas (C) arid regions (D) garden (E) warm place", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. Arid regions.\nExplanation: Lizards are cold-blooded reptiles that require warmth to regulate their body temperature. Arid regions, such as deserts, provide the warm and dry climate that lizards need to survive. While lizards can be found in gardens and warm places, these habitats are not as specific as arid regions. Ball stopped and West Texas are not likely habitats for lizards."}}
{"Q": "What do you use to carry your briefcase?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) office building (B) school (C) courtroom (D) airport (E) hand", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. hand\nExplanation: It is common for individuals to carry their own briefcase by hand, especially when traveling to and from work or meetings. While some may use a rolling briefcase or shoulder strap, the most plausible answer is carrying it by hand. The other options (office building, school, courtroom, airport) are locations where one may use a briefcase, but they do not answer the question of how it is carried."}}
{"Q": "He picked up his pace to a run, he wanted to do what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) learn to walk (B) frightened (C) get away from (D) exercise (E) go faster", "R": {"text": "Answer: (E) go faster\nExplanation: The sentence states that he picked up his pace to a run, which implies that he wanted to go faster. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What would a person do if they do not have any friends?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) talk to people (B) try again (C) fall asleep (D) stand alone (E) thank god", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. talk to people.\nExplanation: If a person does not have any friends, the best way to make new friends is to talk to people. They can join clubs or groups that interest them, attend social events, or even strike up conversations with people they meet in everyday life. It may take some effort and time, but by being open and friendly, they can build new relationships and make new friends. Simply standing alone or falling asleep will not help them make friends, and thanking God may not be a practical solution to their social situation. Trying again is also a good option, but it is important to take action and try different approaches to meet new people."}}
{"Q": "As a result of dying, what happens to organic material?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) change of color (B) stop breathing (C) wake up (D) death and decay (E) getting cold", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Death and decay.\nExplanation: When organic material dies, it begins to decompose and break down into simpler compounds. This process is known as decay and involves the action of bacteria, fungi, and other decomposers. As a result, the organic material loses its structure and eventually turns into soil or other organic matter. This process is essential for the recycling of nutrients in ecosystems and the maintenance of life on Earth."}}
{"Q": "What does everyone have in relation to other people?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) feelings (B) food (C) unique personality (D) different standards (E) values", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. different standards.\nExplanation: Everyone has their own set of standards or expectations for themselves and others, which can differ from person to person. These standards can be influenced by a variety of factors such as culture, upbringing, and personal experiences. Therefore, it is common for people to have different standards in relation to others."}}
{"Q": "What do you ask a child to do when you first meet her?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) ask questions (B) count to ten (C) costume (D) state name (E) dress herself", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. State name.\nExplanation: When meeting a child for the first time, it is appropriate to ask them to state their name. This helps establish a connection and allows for proper introductions. Asking questions or requesting the child to count to ten may be overwhelming or intimidating for some children, while asking them to dress themselves or wear a costume is not relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Where can you buy a clock, clothing and wrenches?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) counter (B) train station (C) school room (D) desk (E) department store", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. department store\nExplanation: A department store typically sells a wide variety of products, including clocks, clothing, and hardware tools like wrenches. It is a more plausible option compared to the other choices, which are unlikely to sell all three items together."}}
{"Q": "What do you do when you're in a new place and want to see new things?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) interesting (B) look around (C) take pictures (D) change of surroundings (E) new experience", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. look around.\nExplanation: When you're in a new place and want to see new things, the most plausible thing to do is to look around and explore your surroundings. This will allow you to discover interesting sights and experiences that you may not have known about otherwise. Taking pictures and seeking a change of surroundings can also be helpful, but they are secondary to the primary action of looking around and taking in your new environment."}}
{"Q": "What happens when to ice when it is in the sun?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) carved (B) melted (C) ice cream (D) antarctica (E) sculptured", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. melted.\nExplanation: When ice is exposed to the sun, it absorbs heat and begins to melt, turning into liquid water. This is a natural process that occurs due to the sun's heat energy. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where can you store your dishes in your dwelling?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) drawer (B) shelf (C) pantry (D) apartment (E) cabinet", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. Cabinet.\nExplanation: Cabinets are specifically designed for storing dishes and are commonly found in kitchens. Drawers are more commonly used for utensils and pantry is typically used for storing food items. While shelves can be used for storing dishes, they are not as practical as cabinets as dishes can easily fall off or get dusty. And an apartment is a type of dwelling, not a storage option for dishes."}}
{"Q": "The man laid on the soft moss and looked up at the trees, where was the man?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) niagra falls (B) forest (C) waterfall (D) ground (E) tree", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. forest\nExplanation: The description of the man laying on soft moss and looking up at trees suggests that he is in a forest. Niagara Falls and waterfalls in general would not have soft moss to lay on, and it would be difficult to look up at trees while on a tree. Ground is too general and could be anywhere, but the mention of soft moss suggests a natural environment like a forest."}}
{"Q": "What is someone doing if he or she is sitting quietly and his or her eyes are moving?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) reading (B) meditate (C) fall asleep (D) bunk (E) think", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: If someone is sitting quietly and their eyes are moving, it is likely that they are thinking or daydreaming. Reading would involve more focused eye movement, while meditating typically involves closed eyes and a still body. Falling asleep would involve the eyes closing and no movement, and bunking refers to skipping or avoiding something, which doesn't fit the description of the person sitting quietly."}}
{"Q": "Where can I find a stapler in many places?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) desk drawer (B) office building (C) manual (D) office supply store (E) desktop", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. office supply store\nExplanation: While a stapler may be found in a desk drawer or on a desktop, these options are not guaranteed in many places. An office building may have multiple staplers, but it is not a reliable source. A manual would not provide a physical stapler. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D, an office supply store, where staplers are readily available for purchase."}}
{"Q": "A man takes a seat at a museum outside of Barcelona, where is he likely?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) in cinema (B) martorell (C) falling down (D) show (E) airplane", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Martorell.\nExplanation: The question mentions that the man is sitting at a museum outside of Barcelona. Martorell is a town located outside of Barcelona and is known for its historical sites and museums. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man is in Martorell rather than in a cinema, falling down, at a show, or on an airplane."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a toy soldier that is being played with?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) toy box (B) movies (C) child's hand (D) toybos (E) child park", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. toy box\nExplanation: A toy soldier is a small toy that is often kept in a toy box along with other toys. It is a common place for children to store their toys when they are not playing with them. While a child may play with a toy soldier in their hand or at a park, it is more likely that the toy soldier would be found in a toy box when not in use. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where are you when you're about to use your plane ticket?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pocket (B) terrorists hands (C) airport (D) sea ship (E) briefcase", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. airport.\nExplanation: When you have a plane ticket, you are most likely at the airport, either waiting to board your flight or checking in for your flight. The other options, such as having it in your pocket or briefcase, are possible, but the question specifically asks where you are about to use the ticket, implying that you are about to travel by plane, which would require being at the airport. The option of terrorists' hands is not a plausible answer as it is a dangerous and illegal situation. The option of sea ship is also not a plausible answer as plane tickets are not used for sea travel."}}
{"Q": "Flowers make a good center focal point, just one of many arrangements that look good on a what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) market (B) table (C) countryside (D) anthology (E) vase", "R": {"text": "Answer: Table.\nExplanation: Flowers are often used as a centerpiece on a table, whether it's a dining table, coffee table, or side table. They add color and beauty to the space and can be arranged in various ways to create different looks. While flowers can also be displayed in a vase, the question is asking for the arrangement that looks good on something, and a table is a more fitting option than a market, countryside, or anthology."}}
{"Q": "How can a human cross a river and not mess up their hair?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) wisconsin (B) waterfall (C) hatred (D) bridge (E) valley", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. bridge\nExplanation: Crossing a river using a bridge would not involve getting wet or being exposed to wind or other elements that could mess up one's hair. It is a practical and common solution for crossing rivers without ruining one's appearance. The other options, such as Wisconsin, waterfall, hatred, and valley, do not provide any feasible solution for crossing a river without messing up one's hair."}}
{"Q": "Batman bought beer.  There were no bottles available.  He had to settle for what?.", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) shelf (B) soccer game (C) keg (D) can (E) refrigerator", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Since there were no bottles available, the most plausible option would be to settle for cans of beer. Cans are a common alternative to bottles and are often readily available in stores and at events. The other options (shelf, soccer game, keg, refrigerator) do not make sense in the context of buying beer without bottles."}}
{"Q": "You can find a monkey in what West African region on the Gulf of Guinea", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) south american country (B) rain forest (C) pay debts (D) works (E) nigeria", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Rain forest.\nExplanation: Monkeys are commonly found in rain forests, which are abundant in West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea. Option A, South American country, is incorrect as monkeys are not native to Africa. Option C, pay debts, and option D, works, are not related to the question. Option E, Nigeria, is a country in West Africa but does not provide a specific location where monkeys can be found."}}
{"Q": "Surprising an angry person could lead to what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) humor (B) fight (C) jocose (D) laughter (E) accidents", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. fight.\nExplanation: Surprising an angry person can trigger their fight or flight response, and in some cases, it may lead to physical aggression or violence. It is important to approach angry individuals with caution and try to de-escalate the situation rather than surprising them."}}
{"Q": "Where is a dining area likely to be small?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) cruise ship (B) home (C) mall (D) restaurant (E) dark cave", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. cruise ship\nExplanation: Dining areas on cruise ships are often small due to limited space on the ship. The focus is on maximizing the number of cabins and amenities, so dining areas may be smaller in order to accommodate other features on the ship. In contrast, homes, malls, and restaurants typically have more space available for dining areas. A dark cave is not a plausible option for a dining area at all."}}
{"Q": "Killing people should not cause what emotion?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) vengeance (B) going to prison (C) joy (D) afraid (E) terrible", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: It is morally and ethically wrong to take someone's life, and therefore, killing someone should not cause joy or any positive emotion. It is important to value human life and respect the sanctity of it."}}
{"Q": "James slamed into someone playing football, and not for the first time.  He was concerned about the consequences of many what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) exhilaration (B) interactions (C) head injuries (D) death (E) having fun", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. head injuries.\nExplanation: The context suggests that James has collided with someone while playing football multiple times, which could lead to head injuries. The other options, such as exhilaration, having fun, interactions, and death, do not fit the context as well as head injuries."}}
{"Q": "More people should lower the guard and just have fun, we don't got long just what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) enjoy living (B) happy (C) enjoyable (D) get laid (E) do enjoy", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. enjoy living.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that people should let go of their inhibitions and enjoy life to the fullest because we don't have much time. The phrase \"lower the guard and just have fun\" implies that people are holding back from enjoying life due to various reasons. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A, which emphasizes the importance of enjoying life. The other options, such as B (happy), C (enjoyable), and E (do enjoy), are similar in meaning to A and could also be plausible, but D (get laid) is not a suitable option as it is inappropriate and does not align with the message of the statement."}}
{"Q": "Where can you get a lizard to keep in your home?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) desert country (B) dessert (C) pet shop (D) tropical areas (E) zoo", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. pet shop\nExplanation: Pet shops are a common place to purchase lizards as pets. They often have a variety of species available and can provide information on how to properly care for them. While lizards can be found in desert and tropical areas, it is not recommended to take them from their natural habitats as it can disrupt the ecosystem and be harmful to the lizard population. Zoos typically do not sell animals for private ownership. Desserts, on the other hand, are not a suitable habitat for lizards."}}
{"Q": "What would use a musical instrument?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) guitar (B) music room (C) orchestra (D) case (E) movie", "R": {"text": "Answer: A guitar.\nExplanation: A guitar is a musical instrument that can be played by strumming or plucking its strings.

{"Q": "She was in an affair, what did that end upon discovery by her husband?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) relationship (B) marriage (C) fidelity (D) love (E) divorce", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Upon discovery of the affair, it is likely that the husband would file for divorce, making option E the most plausible answer. While options A, C, and D may also be affected by the discovery of the affair, divorce is the most common outcome in such situations. Option B, marriage, is not a plausible answer as the affair would have already indicated a breach of the marriage contract."}}
{"Q": "What is the most famous constellation out of earth?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) one moon (B) milky way (C) god's creation (D) stars (E) universe", "R": {"text": "Answer: Milky Way.\nExplanation: The Milky Way is not a constellation, but rather a galaxy that contains our solar system and billions of stars. It is the most famous galaxy in the universe and can be seen from Earth as a band of light in the night sky."}}
{"Q": "If a reception is held with hotel guests walking by, what is the likely venue?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) room service (B) church basement (C) lobby (D) large room (E) country club", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: If hotel guests are walking by, it is likely that the reception is being held in the lobby of the hotel. This is a common area where guests can gather and socialize, and it is easily accessible to all guests staying at the hotel. Rooms service and a church basement are unlikely venues for a hotel reception, while a large room or country club may be possible but not as likely as the lobby."}}
{"Q": "What is a place that is far away from your house and where you could consume beer?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) refrigerator (B) friend's house (C) keg (D) neighbor's house (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "Answer: Friend's house.\nExplanation: A friend's house is a plausible option for a place that is far away from your house and where you could consume beer. It is common for people to gather at a friend's house for social events and to enjoy drinks together. Additionally, it is legal to consume alcohol in a private residence as long as all individuals are of legal drinking age."}}
{"Q": "If a court case is dismissed after hearing testimony, what would be a likely cause?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) change of heart (B) anguish (C) anger (D) boredom (E) anxiety", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) boredom.\nExplanation: If a court case is dismissed after hearing testimony, it is likely due to the judge or jury becoming bored with the case and not finding enough evidence or compelling arguments to continue. A change of heart, anguish, anger, or anxiety would not be likely causes for a dismissal after hearing testimony."}}
{"Q": "Sitting down quickly after eating beans could lead to what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) flatulence (B) happiness (C) laziness (D) fall asleep (E) comfort", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. flatulence.\nExplanation: Beans contain complex sugars that are difficult for the body to break down, leading to the production of gas in the digestive system. Sitting down quickly after eating beans can cause the gas to build up and result in flatulence."}}
{"Q": "John was my neighbor, it was easy to talk to him. He was never what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) away (B) distant (C) remote person (D) bore (E) foe", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that John was easy to talk to, which implies that he was friendly and approachable. Therefore, it is unlikely that he was distant or a remote person (C). The sentence does not provide any information about John being away (A) or a foe (E). The only option left is (D) bore, but the sentence does not suggest that John was boring. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (B) distant, as it is the opposite of friendly and approachable."}}
{"Q": "Where do people want to have a lot of coffee?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) table (B) office (C) desk (D) kitchen (E) ocean", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. kitchen\nExplanation: The kitchen is a common place for people to have coffee as it is where the coffee maker is usually located and it is a convenient place to prepare and enjoy a cup of coffee. While people may also have coffee at a table or desk, the office and ocean are less likely places for people to consume coffee regularly."}}
{"Q": "You stop and have food all around you, what are you?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) stay alive (B) wanted to survive (C) nutrition (D) grew (E) full", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. nutrition\nExplanation: The presence of food around you suggests that you have access to nutrients that can sustain your body and provide energy. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that you are surrounded by nutrition."}}
{"Q": "James was meeting a friend.  They had planed a slow day. They didn't want to do much.  They just wanted what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) relaxation (B) panic (C) alarm (D) joy (E) cheer", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The context suggests that James and his friend wanted a slow and easy day, indicating a desire for relaxation rather than panic, alarm, joy, or cheer."}}
{"Q": "The car's steering seem quite loose, but he still considered purchasing it because he needed something small and what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) sturdy (B) faithful (C) bound (D) compact (E) packaged", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. compact.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the person needs something small, which suggests that they are looking for a compact car. The fact that the steering is loose may be a concern, but it does not necessarily negate the need for a small car. Therefore, option D, compact, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Dan was a farmer with just one heifer.  But that was okay, he only kept her for milk, and he didn't think he'd find good farmland in a place as cold as where?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) arizona (B) farm yard (C) michigan (D) german field (E) dairy farm", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: Michigan is known for its cold climate, especially during the winter months. This makes it less likely for Dan to find good farmland in Michigan, as crops may not grow as well in colder temperatures. Arizona, on the other hand, is known for its warm and sunny climate, making it a more plausible location for good farmland. The other options, such as farm yard and dairy farm, do not make sense as they are not specific locations. German field is also unlikely as it does not provide any context or reasoning for why Dan would be farming in Germany."}}
{"Q": "It's Friday night and Alice puts off going to bed because she plans on doing what Saturday?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) hatred (B) sleeping in (C) rest (D) making love (E) insomnia", "R": {"text": "Answer: Sleeping in.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (B) sleeping in because Alice is putting off going to bed on Friday night, indicating that she wants to stay up late and sleep in the next morning. The other options, such as (A) hatred, (C) rest, and (E) insomnia, do not make sense in this context. (D) making love is possible, but there is no indication in the question that Alice has a partner or plans to engage in sexual activity."}}
{"Q": "His phone was dead and they couldn't find the expressway, he opened up the glove compartment and handed his passenger the what to navigate?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) eastern united states (B) michigan (C) map (D) choppers (E) american city", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that he handed his passenger a map to navigate since they couldn't find the expressway and his phone was dead. Maps are commonly kept in glove compartments for this purpose. The other options, such as eastern United States, Michigan, choppers, and American city, do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "What would someone use a personal key for?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) car stand (B) at hotel (C) own home (D) front door (E) bus depot", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. front door\nExplanation: A personal key is typically used to unlock and secure the front door of one's own home or apartment. It is not commonly used at a car stand, hotel, or bus depot. While a personal key could potentially be used at a hotel, it is more likely that a hotel key card or electronic key would be provided for guests."}}
{"Q": "The cat kept pestering it's owner, it was that time of the day and it was what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) litter tray (B) whiskers (C) hungry (D) feline (E) thirsty", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. hungry\nExplanation: The cat's behavior of pestering its owner suggests that it wants something, and since it's a common behavior for cats to ask for food when they're hungry, it's more plausible that the cat is hungry rather than needing to use the litter tray, having issues with its whiskers, being a feline (which is obvious), or being thirsty."}}
{"Q": "Her voice lent her to the alto section, what group did she join?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) symphony (B) concerto (C) choir (D) theater troupe (E) marching band", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. choir\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person's voice is suited for the alto section, which is typically found in choirs.

{"Q": "Where are you likely to find a Japanese restaurant not run by people from Japan?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) california (B) downtown (C) large town (D) tokio (E) china town", "R": {"text": "Answer: California.\nExplanation: California has a large population of people of Japanese descent and a strong Japanese cultural influence, making it a likely location for a Japanese restaurant not run by people from Japan. Downtown and large towns may also have Japanese restaurants, but they could be run by people from Japan or of Japanese descent. Tokyo is in Japan, so it is unlikely to find a Japanese restaurant not run by people from Japan there. Chinatown typically features Chinese restaurants, not Japanese ones."}}
{"Q": "Animals who have hair and don't lay eggs are what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) reproduce asexually (B) males (C) mammals (D) attack (E) ocean", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. mammals\nExplanation: Animals who have hair and don't lay eggs are characteristics of mammals.

England.\nExplanation: Fox hunting is a traditional sport in England, particularly among the aristocracy. It is unlikely that John, an aristocratic fox hunter, would live in any of the other locations listed, as they do not have a strong tradition or culture of fox hunting."}}
{"Q": "Where is a grape likely to be being fed to someone else?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) field (B) bathroom (C) michigan (D) minnesota (E) painting", "R": {"text": "Answer: Field.\nExplanation: Grapes are typically grown in fields and harvested to be consumed or processed into various products. It is unlikely for someone to be fed a grape in a bathroom or while looking at a painting. Michigan and Minnesota are states and do not provide any context for where a grape might be fed to someone else."}}
{"Q": "Some food can be stored at room temperature until you open it, then you should keep it in what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) shop (B) bookcase (C) shelf (D) refrigerators (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. refrigerators\nExplanation: Once you open certain types of food, such as dairy products or meats, they need to be kept at a colder temperature to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage. The best place to store these types of food after opening is in a refrigerator. Choices A, B, and E are not appropriate places to store food, and while a shelf could be used, it would need to be in a refrigerator to maintain the proper temperature."}}
{"Q": "Sam couldn't get back to sleep because of a dream he had.  It was a what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) awake (B) horror (C) dreamworker (D) reality (E) nightmare", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is E, nightmare, as it is common for people to have difficulty falling back asleep after experiencing a particularly vivid or disturbing dream. The word \"nightmare\" specifically refers to a frightening or unpleasant dream, which fits the description given in the question."}}
{"Q": "If you're going to a party in a new town what are you hoping to make?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) getting drunk (B) making new friends (C) new contacts (D) doing drugs (E) set home", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) making new friends.\nExplanation: Going to a party in a new town can be a great opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. It's always exciting to expand your social circle and learn about different cultures and lifestyles. Getting drunk or doing drugs may impair your ability to make meaningful connections, and going home early would defeat the purpose of going to the party in the first place. Making new contacts could also be a valuable outcome, but it's more likely to happen naturally as you socialize and get to know people."}}
{"Q": "How is riding a bike getting it to move?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) practice (B) sense of balance (C) driving (D) good balance (E) pedalling", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Riding a bike involves pedalling, which is the act of pushing the pedals with your feet to turn the wheels and create forward motion. While practice and good balance are important for riding a bike, they are not the primary means of getting the bike to move. Driving is also not applicable as it typically refers to operating a motor vehicle."}}
{"Q": "Where does one usually keep literature?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) books and magazines (B) own home (C) kitchen (D) shelf (E) meeting", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. shelf\nExplanation: Literature, such as books and magazines, are typically kept on shelves in homes, libraries, bookstores, and other places where they can be easily accessed and organized. While some literature may be kept in other locations, such as on a coffee table or in a bedroom, a shelf is the most common and practical storage option."}}
{"Q": "WHat type of keyboard is made up of one or more pipe divisions?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) killing (B) typewriter (C) office (D) terminal (E) organ", "R": {"text": "Answer: Organ.\nExplanation: An organ keyboard is made up of one or more pipe divisions. The pipes are controlled by the keys on the keyboard, and each division produces a different sound. This type of keyboard is commonly found in churches and concert halls. The other options, such as killing, typewriter, office, and terminal, do not have any association with pipe divisions or organs."}}
{"Q": "The bell rang, and the congregation began to what in to the church?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) run away (B) wind instrument (C) funnel (D) blunderbuss (E) associated with telephones", "R": {"text": "Answer: funnel.\nExplanation: The word \"funnel\" means to direct or channel something into a narrow passage or opening. In this context, it makes sense that the congregation would \"funnel\" into the church after the bell rang, as they would be directed towards the entrance in an orderly fashion. The other choices (run away, wind instrument, blunderbuss, associated with telephones) do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "James needed smooth sandpaper, but instead he got what type?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) rough (B) non smooth (C) uneven (D) plastic (E) bumpy", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The opposite of smooth is rough, so it is more plausible that James got rough sandpaper instead of non smooth, uneven, plastic, or bumpy sandpaper."}}
{"Q": "Where would you borrow furniture if you do not have any?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) sewer (B) neighbor's house (C) apartment (D) room (E) floor", "R": {"text": "Answer: Neighbor's house.\nExplanation: Borrowing furniture from a neighbor's house is a more plausible option as it is common for neighbors to lend or share household items with each other. Sewer, floor, and room are not appropriate places to borrow furniture from, while borrowing furniture from an apartment may not be feasible as it may not belong to the person living there."}}
{"Q": "What must happen for an animal to and it's offspring to continue livng?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) death (B) flying (C) reproducing (D) food consumed (E) eventually die", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. reproducing.\nExplanation: In order for an animal and its offspring to continue living, the animal must reproduce to ensure the survival of its species. While food consumption is necessary for survival, it does not guarantee the continuation of the species. Death and eventually dying are not necessary for the continuation of the species, and flying is not applicable to all animals. Therefore, reproducing is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I want my wine stored in darkness, where should it go?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) movies (B) bed (C) moon (D) vault (E) cellar", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. cellar\nExplanation: A cellar is a common place to store wine because it is typically cool, dark, and has a stable temperature. This helps to preserve the quality of the wine over time. Storing wine in a movie theater or on a bed would not provide the necessary conditions for proper storage, and the moon is obviously not a viable option. A vault could work, but it is not as common or practical as a cellar."}}
{"Q": "If I want to open a steakhouse, what should I get first?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) michigan (B) florida (C) wine (D) texas (E) building", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. Building.\nExplanation: The first step in opening a steakhouse would be to secure a location or building to operate from. Without a physical space, it would be impossible to start the business. Once a building is secured, then the other necessary steps such as obtaining licenses, hiring staff, and purchasing equipment can be taken. The location of the building (in Michigan, Florida, Texas, etc.) can be decided based on market research and personal preference. Wine can be a part of the menu, but it is not the first priority in opening a steakhouse."}}
{"Q": "Sarah didn't like to play but she didn't want to be sedentary and bored, either, so she took up what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) serious (B) longplay (C) musical (D) eat cake (E) doing nothing", "R": {"text": "Answer: (C) musical\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Sarah didn't want to be inactive and uninterested, so she decided to take up something that would keep her engaged and active. Option (A) serious and (B) longplay don't make sense in this context. Option (D) eat cake and (E) doing nothing are both passive activities that wouldn't keep Sarah active. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (C) musical, as it suggests that Sarah took up an activity that would require her to move and engage her mind."}}
{"Q": "Joe found spiders while checking something outside.  What might that be?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cupboard (B) closet (C) storage bag (D) mail box (E) garage", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. garage\nExplanation: Spiders are commonly found in garages as they provide shelter and a suitable environment for them to thrive. Cupboards, closets, storage bags, and mailboxes are less likely to be a habitat for spiders."}}
{"Q": "What would you do if your date does not show up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) wait for (B) bathe (C) go for haircut (D) plan revenge (E) dress nice", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Wait for.\nExplanation: It is always best to give the benefit of the doubt and wait for a reasonable amount of time before assuming the worst. Perhaps there was a miscommunication or an emergency that caused the delay. It is important to communicate with the date and try to find out what happened before jumping to conclusions or taking drastic actions."}}
{"Q": "What did the adult do before the job interview?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) work (B) dress himself (C) marry (D) dress herself (E) drive train", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) work\nExplanation: It is common for adults to have a job or be employed before going for a job interview. They may have worked in a similar field or industry, or have gained relevant experience and skills from previous jobs. Therefore, (A) work is the most plausible answer. The other options, such as (B) dress himself/herself, (C) marry, and (E) drive train, are not necessarily related to job interviews and may not be applicable in all situations."}}
{"Q": "Most items in retail stores are what even when they are on sale?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) overpriced (B) purchase (C) expensive (D) park (E) buying", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Most retail stores mark up their prices in order to make a profit, so even when items are on sale, they may still be overpriced compared to their actual value."}}
{"Q": "John farms anemone in what type of facility?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) michigan (B) swimming pool (C) atlantic ocean (D) nursery (E) gulf of mexico", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. nursery\nExplanation: Anemones are typically grown in controlled environments such as nurseries or aquariums, rather than in natural bodies of water like the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico. Michigan and swimming pools are also unlikely options for anemone farming."}}
{"Q": "Brawn opened the curtains so that the sun could do what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) dry clothes (B) warm house (C) warm room (D) shine brightly (E) get dark", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Brawn opened the curtains so that the sun could shine brightly. This would allow more natural light to enter the room and brighten it up. It is not likely that Brawn opened the curtains to dry clothes or warm the house or room, as those tasks would require more than just sunlight. Getting dark is the opposite of what Brawn would want, so option E can be eliminated."}}
{"Q": "How might releasing energy that has built up feel?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) damage (B) wonderful (C) exhaustion (D) orgasm (E) lazy", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. wonderful\nExplanation: Releasing built-up energy can often feel like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders, leaving you feeling lighter and more relaxed. This can lead to a sense of euphoria and a general feeling of well-being, which could be described as \"wonderful.\""}}
{"Q": "What would you do if you have curiosity but are blind and paralyzed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) hear news (B) analyse (C) go somewhere (D) examine thing (E) see favorite show", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Hear news.\nExplanation: If someone is blind and paralyzed, they may not be able to physically explore or analyze things. However, they can still satisfy their curiosity by listening to news and information about the world around them. This can be done through various mediums such as radio, podcasts, audiobooks, and even conversations with others. Hearing news can also help them stay informed and engaged with the world, which can be important for mental stimulation and overall well-being."}}
{"Q": "Where might it be hard to get furniture to?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) apartment (B) loft (C) store (D) rug (E) stairs", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. stairs\nExplanation: Stairs can be narrow or steep, making it difficult to maneuver large pieces of furniture up or down them. This can make it challenging to get furniture to certain areas of a home or building. While apartments and lofts may have stairs, they may also have elevators or other means of getting furniture in and out. Stores typically have loading docks or other access points for deliveries, and rugs can be rolled up and easily transported."}}
{"Q": "A great teacher can be what when you are attending school?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) detention (B) graduate (C) follower (D) inspiration (E) boredom", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: A great teacher can be an inspiration when you are attending school.

{"Q": "Where would you get jeans and other wearable items to take home with you?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) shopping mall (B) museum (C) laundromat (D) clothing store (E) bedroom", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. clothing store.\nExplanation: Clothing stores are specifically designed to sell wearable items such as jeans, shirts, and other clothing items. Shopping malls may also have clothing stores, but they offer a wider range of products. Museums and laundromats are not places where you would typically find wearable items for purchase. Bedrooms are personal spaces and not places where you would purchase clothing items."}}
{"Q": "In what substance do clouds float?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sky (B) top of mountain (C) air (D) ground level (E) outer space", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. air.\nExplanation: Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets or ice crystals that are suspended in the air. They float in the atmosphere, which is composed of gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (C) air."}}
{"Q": "Where is the large area location of the empire state building?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) manhattan (B) office (C) the city (D) fifth avenue (E) new york city", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Manhattan\nExplanation: The Empire State Building is located in Manhattan, one of the five boroughs of New York City. While \"New York City\" and \"the city\" are also mentioned as choices, they are not as specific as \"Manhattan\" and could refer to any of the five boroughs. \"Office\" and \"Fifth Avenue\" are also mentioned, but they are not as large in scope as \"Manhattan.\""}}
{"Q": "Where do most people make coffee?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) coffee shop (B) office (C) table (D) washing (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. kitchen\nExplanation: Most people make coffee in their own homes, which typically includes a kitchen. While coffee shops and offices may also have coffee-making facilities, the majority of coffee consumption likely occurs in the home kitchen."}}
{"Q": "What kind of service is my body a part of when I'm no longer here?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) bodycam (B) home (C) coffin (D) funeral (E) graveyard", "R": {"text": "Answer: Funeral.\nExplanation: When a person passes away, their body is typically prepared for a funeral service, which may include a viewing or visitation, a ceremony, and a burial or cremation. The funeral service is a way for loved ones to honor and remember the deceased, and to provide closure and support for each other. Therefore, the body is a part of the funeral service when the person is no longer here."}}
{"Q": "Many people wanted to leave their country estates for row houses, what did they need to move to?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) living less expensively (B) england (C) prison (D) city (E) town", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. city\nExplanation: The question suggests that people wanted to leave their country estates, which implies that they were living in rural areas. The only logical option from the given choices for them to move to would be a city, where row houses are typically found. Additionally, cities offer more job opportunities and access to amenities, which could be attractive to those looking to live less expensively or improve their quality of life. England and prison are not relevant to the question, and while town could be a possibility, row houses are more commonly associated with cities."}}
{"Q": "Where can someone get a new saw?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) hardware store (B) toolbox (C) logging camp (D) tool kit (E) auger", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. hardware store\nExplanation: A hardware store is a common place to purchase tools such as saws. They typically have a variety of saws available for purchase, including hand saws, power saws, and specialty saws. A toolbox and tool kit may contain a saw, but they are not typically places to purchase a new one. A logging camp may have saws, but it is not a common place for the general public to purchase tools. An auger is a completely different tool and not related to saws."}}
{"Q": "What would you do to a crime scene before asking a question?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) express information (B) touch everything (C) think (D) give clue (E) analyse", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. think.\nExplanation: Before asking a question at a crime scene, it is important to take a moment to think and assess the situation. This includes observing the scene, taking note of any potential evidence, and considering any possible motives or suspects. Rushing into questioning without proper thought and analysis could potentially contaminate the scene or lead to incorrect assumptions."}}
{"Q": "The man didn't do great in college, all his best memories were late night with his brothers at the what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) big city (B) fraternity house (C) school (D) building (E) big town", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. fraternity house.\nExplanation: The mention of \"brothers\" suggests a close group of male friends, which is often associated with fraternity houses in college. Late nights spent with friends at a fraternity house are a common experience for many college students, especially those who may not have excelled academically. Therefore, option B, fraternity house, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "In a horror movie victims usually trip when the run in order to do what in regards to the killer?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) frightened (B) run up stairs (C) get away from (D) go quickly (E) go faster", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. run up stairs\nExplanation: In horror movies, victims often make the mistake of running up stairs to escape the killer, which is a bad decision because it limits their escape routes and puts them in a vulnerable position. This is a common trope in horror movies and is often used to create tension and suspense."}}
{"Q": "The coach decided to make a lineup change, the team's effort was suffering from what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) stagnant (B) stagnation (C) tradition (D) hunger (E) paper money", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The word \"stagnant\" means lacking in activity or progress, which could be a reason for the team's effort to suffer. The coach may have decided to make a lineup change to shake things up and get the team moving again. \"Stagnation\" is a noun form of the same word and doesn't fit the sentence as well. \"Tradition\" and \"paper money\" are completely unrelated to the sentence, and \"hunger\" could be a reason for increased effort, not decreased effort."}}
{"Q": "Where would you go if you want to buy some clothes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) mall (B) grocery store (C) grocery store (D) shop (E) supermarket", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. mall\nExplanation: A mall is a common place to buy clothes as it typically has a variety of clothing stores and options to choose from. Grocery stores and supermarkets primarily sell food and household items, while a shop is a general term that could refer to any type of store."}}
{"Q": "Where is food likely to stay dry?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) etna (B) cupboard (C) oven (D) stomach (E) fridge", "R": {"text": "Answer: Cupboard.\nExplanation: A cupboard is a storage space in a kitchen or pantry that is typically dry and protected from moisture. Food stored in a cupboard is less likely to become wet or damp, making it a good option for keeping food dry. The other options, such as Etna (a volcano), oven, stomach, and fridge, are not typically associated with keeping food dry."}}
{"Q": "What is it called when a person with mental illness is able to lead a relatively normal life?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) managed (B) effectively treated (C) recur (D) cause delusion (E) illusion", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: When a person with mental illness is able to lead a relatively normal life, it is often referred to as \"managed.\" This means that the person's symptoms are under control through a combination of medication, therapy, and other support systems. It does not necessarily mean that the person is cured or free from symptoms, but rather that they are able to function in their daily life with minimal disruption from their illness."}}
{"Q": "Where do you keep musical instrument so it doesn't get scratched?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bank (B) orchestra (C) case (D) music room (E) movie", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. case\nExplanation: Musical instruments are typically kept in cases to protect them from scratches and other damage. Banks and orchestras are not places where instruments are typically stored, and a music room may not have enough space or security to keep instruments safe. Movies are also not relevant to the storage of musical instruments."}}
{"Q": "The woman is watching television and trying to forget her day, what is her goal?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) entertainment (B) falling asleep (C) getting fat (D) crying (E) relaxation", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. relaxation\nExplanation: The woman's goal is to forget her day, which suggests that she wants to unwind and relax. Watching television can be a form of relaxation, especially if she is watching something that she enjoys. The other options, such as getting fat or crying, do not make sense in this context. Falling asleep is a possibility, but it is not explicitly stated in the question. Therefore, E. relaxation is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "While John Candy and Dan Aykroyd didn't run into a gazelle, you'd have to go where to see one?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) eastern hemisphere (B) the city (C) open plain (D) television program (E) great outdoors", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. open plain\nExplanation: Gazelles are typically found in open plains and grasslands in Africa and Asia, which are not typically found in urban areas or on television programs. While John Candy and Dan Aykroyd may have encountered various wildlife in the movie \"The Great Outdoors,\" gazelles are not native to North America, so the most likely place to see one would be in the open plains of the eastern hemisphere."}}
{"Q": "When we are running what are we doing?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) stretches (B) running from police (C) learn to walk (D) go quickly (E) get out of bed", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. go quickly\nExplanation: When we are running, we are moving quickly on foot, usually with the intention of covering a distance or getting somewhere faster than we would by walking."}}
{"Q": "It's dangerous to let pet birds free so it's better to keep them what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) slavery (B) caught (C) caged in (D) topfree (E) prisoner", "R": {"text": "Answer: Caged in.\nExplanation: Keeping pet birds in a cage is a common and safe practice. It provides them with a controlled environment where they can fly, perch, and play without the risk of getting lost or injured. Allowing them to roam free can expose them to predators, harsh weather conditions, and other dangers. Therefore, it's important to provide them with a comfortable and spacious cage that meets their needs. The other options, such as slavery, caught, topfree, and prisoner, are not appropriate or ethical ways to treat pet birds."}}
{"Q": "A beaver is know for building prowess, their supplies come from where?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) british columbia (B) body of water (C) wooded area (D) pay debts (E) zoo", "R": {"text": "Answer: C.

He's not good at it because he suffers from what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) panic (B) discussion (C) attention (D) confusion (E) satisfaction", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Zane's dislike of answering questions is likely due to his suffering from panic. This could manifest as anxiety or fear when put on the spot or feeling like he doesn't know the answer. It can be difficult for individuals with panic to think clearly and respond effectively in these situations."}}
{"Q": "Going public about a common problem can gain what for a celebrity?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) wide acceptance (B) a degree (C) pain (D) getting high (E) press coverage", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Going public about a common problem can gain press coverage for a celebrity, as it often generates media attention and can lead to increased public awareness and discussion of the issue.

However, it may also come with some negative consequences, such as criticism or backlash from those who disagree with the celebrity's stance or actions."}}
{"Q": "The electricity went out and everyone was shrouded in darkness.  They all remained in their seats, because it would have been dangerous to try to find there way out.  Where mihgt they have been?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) opera (B) concert (C) basement (D) bedroom (E) grand canyon", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) opera\nExplanation: The fact that everyone remained in their seats suggests that they were in a public place with assigned seating, such as a theater or opera house. The other options, such as a concert or bedroom, would not have assigned seating and people would have been more likely to move around in the dark. The basement and Grand Canyon are also unlikely options as they are not typically places where large groups of people would be seated together."}}
{"Q": "Where could you find hundreds of beauty salon?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) clerk (B) mall (C) strip mall (D) city (E) neighborhood", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. strip mall\nExplanation: Strip malls typically have multiple businesses in one location, including beauty salons. It is common to find several beauty salons in a strip mall, making it a plausible answer for where you could find hundreds of them. While malls and neighborhoods may also have beauty salons, they may not have as many options as a strip mall. A city may have a large number of beauty salons, but it is unlikely that there would be hundreds in one specific area. A clerk would not be able to provide information on where to find beauty salons."}}
{"Q": "If it is Chrismas time what came most recently before?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) halloween (B) summer (C) easter (D) kwaanza (E) give gift", "R": {"text": "Answer: Easter.\nExplanation: Easter typically falls in the spring, several months before Christmas. Halloween and Kwanzaa are also holidays that occur before Christmas, but they are closer in time to Christmas than Easter.

Adding a niece limb to the family tree would be the most appropriate way to document the new addition to the family. The other options, such as a family picture book or baby shower, are more focused on celebrating the new arrival rather than documenting their place in the family."}}
{"Q": "The criminal insisted he must do the crime to the bank teller, but she tried to convince him there were other ways in life and this was what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) willing (B) optional (C) should not (D) have to (E) unnecessary", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The bank teller is trying to convince the criminal that committing a crime is not the right choice and that he should not do it.

{"Q": "what do you fill with ink to write?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) squid (B) fountain pen (C) pencil case (D) newspaper (E) printer", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Fountain pen.\nExplanation: Fountain pens are writing instruments that use ink as their writing medium. They have a reservoir or cartridge that holds the ink, which is then fed to the nib through a mechanism. Squids are not commonly used for writing, pencil cases are used to store writing instruments, newspapers are printed with ink but not used for writing, and printers use ink to print but are not used for writing by hand."}}
{"Q": "He walked into the room and had a great shock, his friends had what him?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) expected (B) wanting (C) calm (D) thundershock (E) surprised", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The word \"shock\" implies a sudden and unexpected event, so it is more plausible that the person was surprised by what they saw rather than expecting it (A) or wanting it (B). The word \"calm\" (C) does not fit with the context of the sentence. \"Thundershock\" (D) is not a commonly used word and does not make sense in this context. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E, \"surprised.\""}}
{"Q": "He wasn't the hugging type, even when he meet friend he'd just do what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) have sex (B) smile (C) hug each other (D) conversation (E) handshake", "R": {"text": "Answer: (E) handshake\nExplanation: Given the context of the sentence, it is unlikely that the person would immediately have sex with their friend upon meeting them. Smiling is a possibility, but the sentence specifically mentions physical contact, making a handshake a more plausible option than just a smile or conversation. Hugging is explicitly ruled out in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "If you were lost you might need a map, the best place to find one on the road is at any what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) truck stop (B) amusement park (C) atlas (D) mall (E) gas station", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Gas stations often have maps available for purchase or for free, especially those located near highways or major roads. They are also likely to have local maps and directions to nearby attractions or landmarks. Truck stops and rest areas may also have maps, but gas stations are more commonly found and accessible. Amusement parks and malls are unlikely to have maps for general navigation purposes, and an atlas is a book rather than a place to find a map on the road."}}
{"Q": "Where would you put a net if you wanted to use it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) sports (B) fishing gear (C) soccer game (D) fishing boat (E) badminton", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. sports\nExplanation: Nets are commonly used in various sports such as basketball, volleyball, tennis, and even in some forms of hockey. Therefore, it is more plausible to put a net in a sports setting rather than in a fishing boat or using it for fishing gear. While soccer games do use nets, it is not the only sport that uses them. Badminton also uses nets, but it is not as commonly associated with nets as other sports. Therefore, A. sports is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sage loved communicating  He liked doing what with his peers?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) exchanging ideas (B) confusion (C) peer pressure (D) response (E) learning", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Sage loved communicating and one of the things he enjoyed doing with his peers was exchanging ideas.

Freezing is also an option, but it may affect the texture and taste of the steak when it's thawed. The oven and grill are cooking methods and not suitable for storing food, while storing steak on a plate is not airtight and can lead to spoilage."}}

{"Q": "Something had the nerve to break into the garbage last night, what did it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) eyes (B) animal (C) fingertips (D) brainstem (E) human body", "R": {"text": "Answer: Animal.\nExplanation: It is more likely that an animal broke into the garbage than any of the other options given. Animals are known to scavenge for food in garbage cans, while eyes, fingertips, brainstems, and human bodies do not have the ability to physically break into garbage cans."}}
{"Q": "Where would you go to get some pamphlets if you want to own them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bookstore (B) drawer (C) health department (D) mail box (E) library", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. library\nExplanation: Libraries are known for having a wide variety of pamphlets on different topics that people can take for free. Bookstores may have pamphlets for sale, but they are not typically the primary source for pamphlets. Drawers and mailboxes are unlikely places to find pamphlets, and while the health department may have health-related pamphlets, it may not have pamphlets on other topics."}}
{"Q": "The audience cheered when a goal was scored, what were they spectating?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) school (B) sporting event (C) concert hall (D) show (E) television", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. sporting event.\nExplanation: The fact that the audience cheered when a goal was scored indicates that they were most likely watching a sporting event, such as a soccer or hockey game.

{"Q": "Everybody seemed to be crying at the holy site, the tour guide explained that this was what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) profane (B) halibut (C) damaged (D) common (E) halibut", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The word \"common\" means something that is widespread or prevalent. In this context, it is likely that the tour guide was explaining that it is common for people to cry at the holy site due to its emotional and spiritual significance. The other options, such as \"profane\" (meaning disrespectful), \"halibut\" (a type of fish), and \"damaged\" (meaning broken or harmed), do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The smile gave away that the what was one of happiness?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) manual (B) rainbow (C) cry (D) frown (E) make others happy too", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. frown\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the smile was an expression of happiness. The opposite of a smile is a frown, which is an expression of sadness or displeasure. Therefore, option D, frown, is the most plausible answer. The other options, manual, rainbow, and make others happy too, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Option C, cry, is also unlikely as crying is not typically associated with happiness."}}
{"Q": "Where is a public monument likely to be erected by a city?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) municipal park (B) office (C) state park (D) cemetary (E) public gardens", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Municipal park.\nExplanation: Municipal parks are often used as public spaces for community events and gatherings, making them a popular location for public monuments. They are easily accessible to the public and provide a central location for people to visit and appreciate the monument. Office buildings, state parks, cemeteries, and public gardens may also have monuments, but they are less likely to be erected by a city government."}}
{"Q": "Where would a person live if they wanted no neighbors?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) housing estate (B) neighborhood (C) mars (D) woods (E) suburbs", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. woods\nExplanation: If a person wants no neighbors, the best option would be to live in the woods. The woods provide a natural setting with plenty of space and privacy. While living in the suburbs or a housing estate may provide some level of privacy, there will still be neighbors nearby. Living on Mars is not currently feasible, and a neighborhood by definition implies the presence of neighbors. Therefore, the most plausible option is to live in the woods."}}
{"Q": "Where is the control room that controls a PWR located?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) building (B) factory (C) window (D) prison (E) nuclear power plant", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. nuclear power plant\nExplanation: The control room that controls a pressurized water reactor (PWR) is typically located within the nuclear power plant itself. This is where trained operators monitor and control the various systems and processes that make up the PWR, ensuring safe and efficient operation. The control room is a critical component of the plant, and is designed to withstand a variety of potential hazards, including earthquakes, fires, and other emergencies."}}
{"Q": "What happens to a dog before someone puts up posters of them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) get lost (B) require water (C) trained (D) bark (E) roll over", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. get lost\nExplanation: Dogs usually end up on missing posters because they have wandered away from their home or gotten lost.

{"Q": "If you're attending school and are falling asleep you're likely experiencing what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) boredom (B) malaria (C) graduate (D) inspiration (E) detention", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. boredom\nExplanation: If someone is falling asleep while attending school, it is likely that they are bored with the material being presented. This could be due to a lack of interest in the subject or a teaching style that does not engage the student. Malaria, graduate, inspiration, and detention are not likely causes of falling asleep in class."}}
{"Q": "I want to buy a gong, where should I look for one?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) orchestra (B) church (C) chinese temple (D) chinatown (E) music store", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. music store\nExplanation: A music store is the most plausible option for buying a gong as they specialize in selling musical instruments. While orchestras and churches may have gongs, they are not likely to sell them to individuals. Chinese temples and Chinatown may have gongs for sale, but they may not be easily accessible or may not have a wide selection. A music store is the most convenient and reliable option for purchasing a gong."}}
{"Q": "What would friends do if they need each others' help?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) call each other (B) group together (C) understand each other (D) meet for lunch (E) part company", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. call each other.\nExplanation: When friends need each other's help, the most plausible thing to do is to call each other. This way, they can discuss the problem and come up with a solution together. Grouping together or meeting for lunch may not always be possible, especially if the problem requires immediate attention. Understanding each other is important, but it may not necessarily solve the problem at hand. Parting company is not an option when friends need each other's help."}}
{"Q": "When people are playing a game, what is their motivation to play?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) believe in god (B) dance (C) desire to win (D) destroy each other (E) run amok", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. Desire to win.\nExplanation: The primary motivation for most people when playing a game is to win. Winning provides a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, and can also lead to rewards such as prizes or recognition. While some people may play games for other reasons such as socializing or stress relief, the desire to win is a common and powerful motivator for many players. Believing in god, dancing, destroying each other, or running amok are unlikely to be motivations for playing a game."}}
{"Q": "Where could there be a battle that involves words?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) court room (B) war (C) video game (D) iraq (E) church", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. court room\nExplanation: A court room is a place where legal battles take place and arguments are presented using words. Lawyers use their words to persuade the judge and jury to rule in their favor. It is a battle of words and evidence, rather than physical combat."}}

He did not like doing what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) have to wait for (B) standing in line (C) eat cake (D) less confusion (E) being ordered", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: John didn't mind getting in line, but he hated standing in line because it caused him discomfort and inconvenience, such as sore feet and wasted time. Therefore, option B, standing in line, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What is the process of going somewhere?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) fire (B) energy (C) car (D) transporting (E) staying in place", "R": {"text": "Answer: Transporting.\nExplanation: Transporting refers to the act of moving from one place to another, which is the process of going somewhere. Fire and energy are not relevant to the process of going somewhere, while staying in place is the opposite of going somewhere. While a car can be a means of transportation, it is not the only way to go somewhere."}}
{"Q": "The old man needed to have rest multiple times a day, he would do what on the couch and catnap?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) lay in bed (B) lay in bed (C) go to bed (D) relax (E) lie down", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The word \"catnap\" suggests a short period of sleep, and the option \"lie down\" is more appropriate for this situation than \"go to bed\" or \"lay in bed,\" which imply a longer period of rest. \"Relax\" is a possible option, but \"lie down\" specifically indicates that the old man is resting on the couch."}}
{"Q": "The end of the barrel of what primitive firearm is bell shaped?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) barbell (B) funnel (C) blunderbuss (D) wind instrument (E) kettlebell", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. blunderbuss\nExplanation: The end of a blunderbuss firearm is typically bell-shaped, allowing for a wider spread of shot when fired. The other choices, such as barbell, funnel, wind instrument, and kettlebell, do not have any association with firearms."}}
{"Q": "Where is a good place to store pamphlets in your home or office?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) library (B) health department (C) mail box (D) drawer (E) bookstore", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: A drawer is a practical and common place to store pamphlets in both a home or office setting. It keeps them organized and easily accessible while also keeping them out of sight and not cluttering up other areas. The other options, such as a library or bookstore, may be suitable for distributing pamphlets but not necessarily for storing them. The health department may be a relevant option for storing health-related pamphlets, but it may not be accessible or practical for everyone. The mailbox is not a suitable option for storing pamphlets as it is meant for receiving mail."}}
{"Q": "Many humans enjoy fishing and enjoy another relaxing activity at the same time, what activity is it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) getting tied up lure. (B) looking for information (C) get wet (D) drink beer (E) sit quietly", "R": {"text": "Answer: Sit quietly.\nExplanation: Fishing is often seen as a peaceful and relaxing activity, and many people enjoy sitting quietly while waiting for a fish to bite. While some people may drink beer while fishing, it is not necessarily a common or necessary part of the activity. Getting tied up lure and getting wet are both potential frustrations or hazards of fishing, rather than enjoyable activities. Looking for information may be a part of preparing for a fishing trip, but it is not typically something that is done while actively fishing. Therefore, sitting quietly is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get some maps that you own?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) bookstore (B) library (C) electrical circuit (D) cabinet (E) important when traveling", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. library\nExplanation: Libraries typically have a wide selection of maps available for borrowing or reference. While bookstores may also sell maps, owning maps is not necessarily the focus of the question. The other options, electrical circuit and cabinet, are not relevant to obtaining maps. The phrase \"important when traveling\" is not a choice, but rather a statement that emphasizes the usefulness of maps in general."}}

While it can certainly be enjoyed at a restaurant or fast food establishment, the most logical place to put a hamburger would be in a kitchen before it is served or consumed."}}
{"Q": "Where is a handy place to store a steel pen in your office?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) car shop (B) desk drawer (C) car. (D) warehouse (E) hand", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Desk drawer.\nExplanation: Storing a steel pen in a desk drawer is a common and convenient option for office settings. It keeps the pen easily accessible while also keeping it safe and secure when not in use. The other options, such as a car shop, car, warehouse, or hand, are not as practical or appropriate for storing a pen in an office setting."}}
{"Q": "A story about World War II would be set when?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) book or library (B) book or magazine (C) newspaper (D) past (E) future", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. past\nExplanation: World War II took place from 1939 to 1945, so it is a historical event that happened in the past. Therefore, it would be more plausible to find a story about World War II set in the past."}}
{"Q": "What type of geographic area will you find a marmot?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) mountainous area (B) wood pile (C) jungle (D) petting zoo (E) animals", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. mountainous area.\nExplanation: Marmots are typically found in mountainous areas, particularly in rocky alpine and subalpine habitats. They are well adapted to living in high altitude environments and are often seen basking in the sun on rocks or scurrying around in search of food. They are not typically found in wood piles, jungles, or petting zoos."}}
{"Q": "Most people make stupid assumptions that are based on their prejudices.  What might they do instead to achieve better outcomes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) set table (B) think (C) read books (D) play games (E) lie", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Instead of making assumptions based on prejudices, people should take the time to think critically and objectively about the situation. This involves considering all available information and perspectives, and being open to changing one's initial assumptions if new evidence arises. By doing so, people can achieve better outcomes and avoid making harmful or unfair judgments."}}
{"Q": "What is something children can do while traveling in a car?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) listen to music (B) watch television (C) play chess (D) walk (E) play basketball", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. listen to music\nExplanation: Listening to music is a common and safe activity for children to do while traveling in a car. It can help pass the time and keep them entertained without distracting the driver. Watching television or playing basketball are not feasible options while in a car, and playing chess requires a flat surface and pieces that could easily get lost or fall over. Walking is also not possible while in a car."}}
{"Q": "Where would you hear a trumpet along with other instruments made from the same material?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) music store (B) bass (C) brass band (D) orchestra (E) marching band", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. brass band\nExplanation: A brass band typically consists of instruments made from brass, including trumpets, trombones, and tubas. Therefore, it is more likely to hear a trumpet along with other brass instruments in a brass band rather than in a music store, bass, orchestra, or marching band."}}
{"Q": "The audience listened to the orchestra play, where were they watching the performance?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) concert hall (B) museum (C) school (D) hockey game (E) sporting event", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. concert hall\nExplanation: The orchestra is typically associated with classical music, which is often performed in concert halls. Museums and schools may also host musical performances, but they are less likely to feature orchestras. Hockey games and sporting events are not typically associated with orchestral performances. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A. concert hall."}}
{"Q": "Stabbing to death of a person is what sort of way to die?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) pool of blood (B) gruesome (C) charming (D) being arrested (E) killing", "R": {"text": "Answer: Gruesome.\nExplanation: Stabbing to death is a violent and brutal way to die, resulting in a lot of blood loss and physical trauma. It is not a charming or pleasant way to go, and it often involves a lot of pain and suffering for the victim. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is \"gruesome.\""}}
{"Q": "What are you getting from you boss at the end of the week?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) asking for (B) money (C) food (D) work (E) energy", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. money\nExplanation: It is common for employees to receive their salary or wages at the end of the week or month from their boss. Therefore, it is more plausible that the answer is money rather than asking for something, food, work, or energy."}}
{"Q": "If you have a ticket and you are planning to eat hot dogs, where would you go?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) lottery (B) person's hand (C) baseball stadium (D) movie (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. baseball stadium\nExplanation: Baseball stadiums are known for selling hot dogs as a popular food item for fans to enjoy while watching the game.

{"Q": "Where is a great place to buy fresh fruit?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) san francisco (B) refrigerator (C) big box retailer (D) tree (E) market", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. market\nExplanation: Markets are known for selling fresh produce, including fruits. They often source their products locally and have a higher turnover rate, ensuring that the fruits are fresh and of good quality. Additionally, markets often offer a wider variety of fruits compared to big box retailers."}}
{"Q": "The man took paperwork to other people to consult over it, where was he heading?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) desk (B) meeting (C) office (D) table (E) work", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. office\nExplanation: Taking paperwork to other people to consult over it suggests that the man was going to an office where he could discuss the documents with colleagues or superiors. Desks, tables, and work areas are all possible locations within an office, but \"office\" is the most general and likely option. A meeting could also take place in an office, but the sentence does not specifically mention a meeting."}}
{"Q": "Stark was just having fun, and he wasn't hurting anyone.  What might have he been doing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) painting his nails (B) playing marbles (C) constructing (D) need for rest (E) wild ride", "R": {"text": "Answer: Playing marbles.\nExplanation: Playing marbles is a fun activity that doesn't harm anyone. It is a common childhood game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Painting nails and constructing may also be fun activities, but they are not necessarily activities that everyone enjoys. Need for rest and wild ride are not activities that one can do for fun without potentially harming themselves or others. Therefore, playing marbles is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The church was giving assistance, what were they hoping to accomplish?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) exhilliration (B) hardship (C) risk taking (D) helping others (E) happiness", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. helping others.\nExplanation: The church was giving assistance, which implies that their goal was to help others in need. The other options (exhilaration, hardship, risk-taking, and happiness) do not make sense in this context and are not related to the act of giving assistance."}}
{"Q": "I you believe in god, where will you go when you die?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) heaven (B) church (C) imagination (D) synagogue (E) monastery", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Heaven.\nExplanation: If someone believes in God, they likely believe in an afterlife and the concept of heaven. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer. Church, synagogue, and monastery are places of worship and not necessarily where one goes after death. Imagination is not a physical place."}}
{"Q": "What can eating hamburger cause immediately after eating it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) tasty (B) health problems (C) eat cake (D) indigestion (E) gain weight", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Eating a hamburger can cause indigestion immediately after consuming it due to its high fat content and processed ingredients. This can lead to discomfort and digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and heartburn."}}
{"Q": "Where is a shelf likely to be hidden behind a door?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) refrigerator (B) bookstore (C) cupboard (D) school building (E) wardrobe", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. cupboard\nExplanation: A shelf is commonly hidden behind a door in a cupboard, which is a piece of furniture designed for storage.

It is used to keep food and drinks cold and prevent spoilage. An ice pack can also be used for temporary cold storage, but it is not a permanent solution like a refrigerator. A freezer is another type of cold storage found in many households, but it is typically used for long-term storage of frozen foods. A laboratory and warehouse are not typically found in a household setting."}}
{"Q": "Where could you go to between 1000 and 10000 restaurant?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) big city (B) town (C) small town (D) canada (E) yellow pages", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. big city.\nExplanation: Big cities typically have a larger population and more diverse dining options, which would increase the likelihood of having between 1000 and 10000 restaurants. Small towns and towns may not have as many options, and Canada and Yellow Pages are not physical locations where one could go to find restaurants."}}
{"Q": "The pitcher stepped on the mound ready to throw, where was he located specifically?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) hell (B) baseball stadium (C) golf course (D) africa (E) baseball diamond", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. baseball diamond.\nExplanation: The phrase \"stepped on the mound\" is a common expression used in baseball to refer to the pitcher taking their position on the raised area of dirt in the center of the field where they stand to throw the ball.

{"Q": "Where is a statute found on a platform?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) below (B) arena (C) concert hall (D) museum (E) building", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: A platform is typically associated with a building, such as a stage in a theater or a podium in a conference room. Therefore, it is more likely that a statute would be found on a platform in a building, such as a courthouse or government building, rather than in an arena, concert hall, or museum."}}
{"Q": "If it's not used for hair a round brush is an example of what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) hair brush (B) ladies bathroom (C) art supplies (D) shower (E) hair salon", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. art supplies\nExplanation: A round brush can be used for painting or other art projects, in addition to being used for styling hair. It is not limited to just being a hair brush or being found in a ladies bathroom or hair salon. It is also not typically used in the shower. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is an example of art supplies."}}
{"Q": "His parents thought he was suffering from boredom, but the teen loved to lay in bed and just do what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) meet interesting people (B) lift weights (C) listen to music (D) play chess (E) entertain", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. listen to music.\nExplanation: The fact that the teen loves to lay in bed suggests that he is not interested in physical activities like lifting weights or playing chess. Meeting interesting people and entertaining others also seem unlikely as he is alone in his bed. Listening to music, on the other hand, is a common activity that can be done while lying down and can provide entertainment and relaxation. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "At the picnic she was stuck eating hamburger, she was worried because she forgot her chewables to prevent what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) eat cake (B) have fun (C) food poisoning (D) heartburn (E) gain weight", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. food poisoning.\nExplanation: The fact that the person forgot their chewables suggests that they may have been taking some sort of medication or supplement to prevent food poisoning. Hamburger can be a risky food to eat at a picnic if it is not cooked properly or if it has been sitting out in the sun for too long. Forgetting the chewables could leave the person vulnerable to getting sick from the food. The other answer choices (eating cake, having fun, heartburn, gaining weight) do not seem to be related to the situation described in the question."}}
{"Q": "The electrode wouldn't spark, it turned out that the what hadn't been connected?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) battery (B) electronic equipment (C) electrolytic cell (D) charge (E) tube", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. battery\nExplanation: The electrode requires a source of energy to create a spark, which is typically provided by a battery. If the battery is not connected or is dead, the electrode will not spark. The other options (B) electronic equipment, (C) electrolytic cell, (D) charge, and (E) tube are not directly related to the function of the electrode and would not prevent it from sparking if they were not connected."}}
{"Q": "For what entity should the government work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) country (B) democracy (C) canada (D) civilization (E) tax office", "R": {"text": "Answer: Country.\nExplanation: The government should work for the country as a whole, representing the interests of all its citizens and ensuring the well-being and prosperity of the nation. While democracy is an important aspect of the government's function, it is ultimately a means to achieve the goal of serving the country. Canada and civilization are too broad and vague to be considered the primary entity for the government to work for, and the tax office is a specific department within the government that serves a particular function but is not the overarching entity for the government's work."}}
{"Q": "What must a student in engineering do?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) answer question (B) learn language (C) do mathematics (D) be able to count (E) begin to study", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. do mathematics.\nExplanation: Engineering involves a lot of mathematical calculations and problem-solving. Therefore, a student in engineering must have a strong foundation in mathematics and be able to apply it to real-world situations. While language skills and counting ability are important, they are not as essential as mathematical proficiency in the field of engineering. Beginning to study is also important, but it is not specific to engineering and applies to any academic pursuit."}}

This would allow them to solve more complex problems and have a deeper understanding of how numbers work together. Choice C, putting together, and choice D, unity, do not necessarily follow logically from understanding division. Choice A, multiplication, is the most likely answer, as it is the inverse operation of division. Choice E, pay debts, is not related to math concepts and is therefore an irrelevant option."}}

In a tomb or an arena, there would be no need for an elevator, and in a house, the central passage would likely lead to a staircase rather than an elevator. Access rooms could refer to a variety of settings, but a public building is the most likely option."}}

Getting dirty (A) is the opposite of what you want to do, and writing (B) has nothing to do with cleaning clothes. While using water (C) is necessary, it alone won't clean clothes. Soap (E) is also necessary, but it's not enough on its own either. Laundering is the process of using water, soap, and sometimes other cleaning agents to clean clothes."}}

The other options, such as gaining weight or getting bigger, may be related to weight loss but are not directly caused by using a shrink ray backwards."}}
{"Q": "Christine couldn't be having a baby at her age, she thought to herself. What was Christine?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) old person (B) begin to talk (C) adult (D) old man (E) girl", "R": {"text": "Answer: Adult.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Christine is surprised or doubtful about the possibility of her having a baby at her age, which implies that she is not too young or too old.

{"Q": "Joe plays a percussion instrument in something.  What might be play in?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) own home (B) music store (C) marching band (D) orchestra (E) party", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. marching band\nExplanation: Playing a percussion instrument is common in marching bands, where drums and other percussion instruments are used to keep the beat and add rhythm to the music while marching.

Cheating and sabotage are unethical and can result in disqualification or penalties. Practicing is important to improve skills, but it does not necessarily determine the fairness of the competition. Being in competition is a given if one is competing against someone, but it does not address the fairness of the terms. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B. fair."}}

Garments made from silk, such as dresses, blouses, and suits, would be the most appropriate item to showcase the beauty and quality of silk. Jeans and parachutes are made from more durable and practical materials, while mulberry trees are the source of silk production but do not showcase the fabric itself. Expensive clothing is a broad category that could include silk, but garments specifically made from silk would be a more specific and effective choice for showcasing the fabric."}}

{"Q": "Where would you hear a violin along side many string and wind instruments?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) school (B) string quartet (C) orchestra (D) kitchen (E) music room", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. orchestra.\nExplanation: An orchestra typically consists of many string and wind instruments, including the violin. It is a common setting to hear a violin played alongside other instruments in a large ensemble. Schools and music rooms may also have orchestras, but they are not as commonly associated with the presence of multiple instruments as an orchestra is. A string quartet, on the other hand, typically only consists of four string instruments and would not have the same variety of instruments as an orchestra. The kitchen is not a typical location for musical performances."}}
{"Q": "What is the sun ultimately responsible for?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) earth warming (B) sun tan (C) light (D) life on earth (E) heat", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The sun is ultimately responsible for life on earth as it provides the energy necessary for photosynthesis, which is the basis of the food chain. Without the sun, life on earth would not exist. While the sun does provide warmth and heat, it is the energy it provides that is essential for life. Sun tans and light are also a result of the sun's energy, but they are not as fundamental as life itself."}}

{"Q": "Where could a personal ficus live?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cabin in the woods (B) california (C) front yard (D) conservatory (E) tropical forest", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Conservatory.\nExplanation: A personal ficus is a type of indoor plant that requires a specific environment to thrive. While it is possible to keep a ficus in a cabin in the woods or in a tropical forest, it would be difficult to maintain the proper temperature, humidity, and light levels that the plant needs. California and front yards may not provide the ideal conditions for a ficus either. A conservatory, on the other hand, is a controlled environment specifically designed for growing plants, making it the most plausible option for a personal ficus to live."}}
{"Q": "The shark actually counted as evidence, so where did the legal team bring it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) court room (B) shallow waters (C) poker game (D) sea world (E) pond arena", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. court room\nExplanation: The shark was counted as evidence, which means it was likely brought to the court room as part of the legal proceedings.

{"Q": "Her son scraped his knee, she fetched a bottle of peroxide from the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) supermarket (B) diaper bag (C) liquor store (D) hollow log (E) medicine cabinet", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: It is more likely that a bottle of peroxide would be found in a medicine cabinet, as it is commonly used for cleaning wounds. The other options, such as a supermarket or liquor store, do not typically carry medical supplies. A diaper bag may have some first aid items, but peroxide is not a common item to carry in a diaper bag. A hollow log is an unlikely place to find a bottle of peroxide."}}
{"Q": "Where would you expect to find a dictionary along side other writings you can borrow?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) classroom (B) shelf (C) explain meaning of words (D) table (E) library", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: A dictionary is a reference book that is commonly found in a library alongside other writings that can be borrowed. Libraries are known for their vast collection of books, including dictionaries, which are used to explain the meaning of words. While a dictionary may also be found in a classroom or on a table, these locations are less likely to have a wide variety of other writings available for borrowing. A shelf may also be a possible location for a dictionary, but it is not as specific as a library. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E, library."}}

Sweat is a byproduct of physical activity and feeling better is a potential outcome of getting in shape, but exercise is the necessary component."}}
{"Q": "A statue that shoots liquid is called a what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) water fountain (B) large city (C) museum (D) pool (E) central park", "R": {"text": "Answer: Water fountain.\nExplanation: A water fountain is a decorative structure that shoots water or liquid into the air.

How did he usually do it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) clothes get stained (B) with brush (C) wallpaper (D) electrical circuit (E) draw", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. with brush\nExplanation: Since the question states that John loved to paint houses, it is most likely that he used a brush to do so. Option A may be a side effect of painting, but it is not a method of painting. Option C refers to a different type of home improvement, and option D is not related to painting at all. Option E refers to drawing, which is a different activity altogether. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "When you wipe you feet on the door mat and walk through the door where do you enter?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) a chair (B) school (C) living room (D) doorway (E) bathroom", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) doorway\nExplanation: When you wipe your feet on the door mat and walk through the door, the most logical place to enter would be the doorway.

{"Q": "What can you use to store a book while traveling?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) library of congress (B) pocket (C) backpack (D) suitcase (E) synagogue", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. backpack\nExplanation: A backpack is a common and practical item for storing books while traveling.

However, it also involves the risk of losing, which can result in great lows and disappointment. Therefore, winning or losing is the most plausible answer. Aggression, gain, and sweat may be factors in competing, but they do not necessarily lead to great highs and lows. Defeat, on the other hand, is directly related to losing and is a more specific and accurate answer."}}
{"Q": "What blocks sunshine?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) summer (B) park (C) desktop (D) sea (E) moon", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. moon\nExplanation: The moon can block sunshine during a solar eclipse when it passes between the sun and the Earth, casting a shadow on the Earth's surface. This is a natural phenomenon that occurs periodically and can be observed with proper eye protection. The other choices, such as summer, park, desktop, and sea, do not block sunshine."}}
{"Q": "When you feel too much heat in your home you can turn on what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) coolness (B) fan (C) get wet (D) coldness (E) air conditioning", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: When feeling too much heat in your home, the most plausible option to turn on would be air conditioning. This is because air conditioning systems are designed to cool down the temperature of a room or space, making it more comfortable to stay in. Turning on a fan or getting wet may provide temporary relief, but they do not address the root cause of the heat and may not be as effective in cooling down the space."}}

Farmhouse.\nExplanation: Since the kitten is going to grow up to be a mouser like its mother, it should spend most of its time in a place where there are mice to catch. A farmhouse is more likely to have mice than a shelter, living room, or warm place. The floor is also a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee the presence of mice."}}
{"Q": "Where is that man buying silk from?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) space shuttle (B) theater (C) china (D) indian resteraunt (E) bar", "R": {"text": "Answer: C.

Producing food is also a general goal of farming, but it is not specific to creating a maze."}}
{"Q": "For many males hair is a concern as they get older, it begins to what, causing a receding hairline?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) thin out (B) grow in ear (C) fall out (D) bulge (E) composted", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. fall out.\nExplanation: As males age, their hair follicles become more sensitive to the hormone DHT, which causes the hair to gradually fall out. This often starts with a receding hairline at the temples and can progress to baldness on the crown of the head. Thinning out (A) and bulging (D) are not typical symptoms of male pattern baldness, while growing hair in the ear (B) and composting (E) are not related to hair loss at all."}}
{"Q": "What happens someone who is bad play poker?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) think (B) ante up (C) drink (D) win money (E) losing money", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. losing money.\nExplanation: If someone is bad at playing poker, they are more likely to make mistakes and lose money. Poker requires skill, strategy, and a bit of luck, so someone who is not good at it may not be able to make the right decisions and end up losing money. Drinking may impair their judgment even further, and simply thinking or anteing up does not guarantee success in the game. Winning money is possible, but unlikely if the player is not skilled."}}
{"Q": "John loved his snake.  It was the only ting he loved. He hated everyone else and was abrasive to most people, but he loved his snake.   How might you describe the snake?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sun itself (B) tropical forest (C) pet (D) rude (E) sharp", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. pet\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that John loved his snake, indicating that it was a pet to him. The other choices, such as \"sun itself\" or \"tropical forest,\" do not make sense in the context of describing a snake that someone loves. \"Rude\" and \"sharp\" are also unlikely choices as they are typically used to describe human behavior or physical characteristics, not animals."}}
{"Q": "The fresh herbs, flowers, and vegetables will shrivel up if people don't do this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) water plants (B) believe in god (C) drive to the nearest pool (D) speaking english (E) raise children", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. water plants\nExplanation: Plants need water to survive and thrive. Without regular watering, they will not receive the necessary moisture to keep their leaves, stems, and flowers healthy and hydrated. As a result, they will begin to wilt and eventually shrivel up. Therefore, watering plants is essential to keep them alive and healthy."}}
{"Q": "I picked from an apple tree outside of Fort Wayne, where am I?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) woods (B) illinois (C) indiana (D) washington state (E) tampa", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. Indiana\nExplanation: Fort Wayne is a city located in Indiana, so it is most likely that the apple tree is also located in Indiana. The other choices, such as woods or Tampa, do not provide any specific location information and are less likely to be correct. Illinois and Washington state are also possible options, but Indiana is the most plausible answer given the context."}}
{"Q": "The janitor never had much to clean after services, but there was still always a paper or two to pick up where?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) synagogue (B) front porch (C) classroom (D) obesity (E) grocery store", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. synagogue\nExplanation: The context of the sentence suggests that the janitor is cleaning up after some kind of religious service, which is most likely to take place in a synagogue. The other options, such as front porch, classroom, obesity, and grocery store, do not fit the context and are unlikely places for a janitor to be cleaning up after a religious service."}}
{"Q": "If you're celebrating with too many cocktails what may you have in the morning?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) drunkenness (B) have fun (C) headache (D) hang over (E) intimacy", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) hangover\nExplanation: Consuming too many cocktails can lead to a hangover in the morning, which is characterized by symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, and dehydration. It is important to drink responsibly and in moderation to avoid experiencing a hangover."}}
{"Q": "Danny found an old film in a sealed what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) clingfilm (B) disneyland (C) cave (D) cabinet (E) movie", "R": {"text": "Answer: Cabinet.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Danny found the old film in a sealed cabinet. A cabinet is a piece of furniture that is commonly used to store items, and it is possible that the film was stored in a cabinet for safekeeping. The other options, such as clingfilm, Disneyland, cave, and movie, do not make as much sense in the context of finding an old film."}}
{"Q": "Where are you likely to find much more than a drop of blood on the floor?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) crime scene (B) vein (C) blood bank (D) slaughter house (E) needle", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. slaughter house\nExplanation: A slaughter house is a place where animals are killed for meat production, and therefore, it is likely to find much more than a drop of blood on the floor. The other options, such as a crime scene, blood bank, vein, or needle, may have blood present, but it is less likely to be in large quantities."}}
{"Q": "Where is the first place someone leaving the planet ends up?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pay debts (B) galaxy (C) outer space (D) orbit (E) universe", "R": {"text": "Answer: Orbit.\nExplanation: When someone leaves the planet, the first place they end up is in orbit around the Earth. This is because they need to reach a certain altitude and speed to break free from the Earth's gravitational pull and enter outer space. Once they are in orbit, they can then continue on to other destinations such as the galaxy or universe. However, paying debts is not related to leaving the planet and the universe is too vast to be considered a specific destination for someone leaving the planet."}}
{"Q": "The town house went right to the curb, a slot effectively made a mailbox of the what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) apartment building (B) front door (C) back door (D) street corner (E) porch", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The sentence describes how the town house is situated right next to the curb, and a slot is mentioned which effectively turns the town house into a mailbox. This suggests that the slot is located on the town house itself, and the most likely location for a mailbox slot would be on the porch. Therefore, option E, porch, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The architect thought that a mezzanine would look good, but the planning committee rejected it.  They told the architect that they felt it was a potential hazard given the ages of the people who would be using it.  What might they be designing?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) actors (B) theater (C) concert hall (D) floors (E) school", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Given the concern about the potential hazard for people of certain ages, it is likely that the architect was designing a space for a school. Mezzanines are often used in schools as additional classroom space or for storage, but they can pose a safety risk for young children. The planning committee's rejection of the mezzanine suggests that they prioritize safety for the students."}}
{"Q": "The person wasn't bothered by the weather, she had remembered to bring her what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) read book (B) own house (C) apartment (D) more rice (E) warm coat", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is E, warm coat, as it directly relates to being able to withstand cold weather. A read book, own house, apartment, or more rice would not have any impact on the person's ability to tolerate the weather."}}
{"Q": "If you want to learn about the world and understand the real reasons behind cultural norms and mores, you have achieved a sense of what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) enlightenment (B) open mind (C) confusion (D) smartness (E) anger", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. open mind.\nExplanation: To truly learn about the world and understand cultural norms and mores, one must approach the subject matter with an open mind. This means being willing to consider different perspectives and ideas, and being receptive to new information and experiences. Having an open mind allows for personal growth and a deeper understanding of the world around us."}}
{"Q": "What is the hopeful result of going to see a play?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) sit (B) being entertained (C) jobless (D) meet (E) laugh", "R": {"text": "Answer: Being entertained.\nExplanation: The purpose of going to see a play is to be entertained and enjoy the performance. While sitting is a necessary part of watching a play, it is not the hopeful result. Being jobless or meeting someone are not typically the goals of attending a play. While laughing may be a desired outcome, it is not always the case as some plays may have serious or dramatic themes."}}
{"Q": "A person would join a trade school for finding information related to what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) ulcers (B) degree (C) understanding of (D) gaining knowledge (E) happiness", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. degree\nExplanation: Trade schools typically offer vocational or technical training programs that lead to a specific degree or certification in a particular field, such as welding, plumbing, or cosmetology. Therefore, a person would join a trade school to gain the necessary skills and knowledge to obtain a degree or certification in their chosen field."}}
{"Q": "Joan was a baby, so there were many things she couldn't do, which caused problems for her parents.  Name one thing that makes raising a baby difficult.", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) arrive early (B) learn to walk (C) boy or girl (D) bring joy (E) talk nonsense", "R": {"text": "Answer: Learn to walk.\nExplanation: Learning to walk is a major milestone for babies, but it also poses a challenge for parents. Babies are unsteady on their feet and can easily fall or hurt themselves. Parents need to constantly supervise and assist their baby in learning to walk, which can be exhausting and time-consuming. Additionally, babies who are not yet walking may require more carrying and holding, which can be physically demanding for parents."}}
{"Q": "Where would you put some ham if you want to cook it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) hamshackle (B) pizza (C) fridge (D) refrigerator (E) part of meal", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) refrigerator\nExplanation: Ham is a perishable food item that needs to be stored in a cool place to prevent spoilage. The most common place to store ham before cooking is in the refrigerator. This will keep the ham fresh and safe to eat until you are ready to cook it. The other options, such as hamshackle or pizza, do not make sense as places to store ham before cooking."}}
{"Q": "Running errands with screaming kids will likely cause what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) efficiency (B) insanity (C) aggravation (D) tiredness (E) stress", "R": {"text": "Answer: (C) aggravation.\nExplanation: It is highly likely that running errands with screaming kids will cause aggravation as it can be a stressful and frustrating experience. The noise and chaos can make it difficult to focus and complete tasks efficiently, leading to increased stress and irritation."}}
{"Q": "Sam wasn't lying, but he left out important details. He was being what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) dishonesty (B) deceitful (C) imagination (D) deceptive (E) poker face", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) deceptive\nExplanation: Deceptive means intentionally misleading or concealing important information. Sam's actions of not disclosing important details can be considered deceptive, as he was not being completely honest."}}
{"Q": "what does someone have that causes them committing murder?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) problems (B) distress (C) fear (D) go to jail (E) killer", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. problems\nExplanation: People who commit murder often have underlying problems such as mental illness, substance abuse, or a history of trauma. These problems can lead to a lack of impulse control and an inability to cope with stress or difficult situations, which may result in violent behavior. While fear or distress may be contributing factors, they are not necessarily the root cause of someone committing murder. Similarly, the desire to avoid going to jail is not a sufficient explanation for why someone would take another person's life. The term \"killer\" is too broad and does not provide any insight into the specific factors that may have led to the act of murder."}}
{"Q": "What kind of place has a leader?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) army (B) battle (C) wildlife (D) country (E) organization", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. country\nExplanation: A country typically has a leader, such as a president or prime minister, who is responsible for governing and making decisions on behalf of the nation. While other options like an army or organization may also have leaders, a country is the most plausible answer as it is a larger entity that requires a centralized authority to manage its affairs."}}
{"Q": "How is a person likely to communicatewith others?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) say words (B) meet friends (C) open mouth (D) thank god (E) die of cancer", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Say words.\nExplanation: Communication typically involves the use of language, which is expressed through spoken or written words. While meeting friends and opening one's mouth may be part of the process of communication, they are not sufficient on their own. Thanking God and dying of cancer are not relevant to the question. Therefore, saying words is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where may you be if you're buying pork chops at a corner shop?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) england (B) town (C) desert (D) kentucky (E) iowa", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) town\nExplanation: It is more likely that you would find a corner shop selling pork chops in a town rather than in a desert or in a specific state like Kentucky or Iowa. England is also a possibility, but the question does not provide enough information to determine the location."}}
{"Q": "Where is a well used toy car likely to be found?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) child's room (B) boy's bedroom (C) own home (D) toy store (E) house", "R": {"text": "Answer: Child's room.\nExplanation: A well used toy car is most likely to be found in a child's room as that is where they would play with it the most. It is less likely to be found in a boy's bedroom or a toy store as it would have already been purchased and taken home. The option of 'own home' and 'house' are too broad and do not provide a specific location."}}
{"Q": "Where can fisherman store their rods when on a fishing trip?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) hardware store (B) engine (C) fishing camp (D) lake (E) sporting goods store", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. fishing camp\nExplanation: Fishing camps often provide storage options for fishermen to store their rods when not in use. This allows fishermen to easily access their equipment and keep it safe while they are not using it. Hardware stores and sporting goods stores may sell fishing equipment, but they typically do not offer storage options for customers. Storing rods in an engine or at a lake would not be practical or safe."}}
{"Q": "Danny is having fun just dancing and singing with his friends. He wasn't concerned with things that weren't fun. For him having fun is the same as what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) injuries (B) smiling (C) being happy (D) glee (E) jump", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: Danny's focus on having fun suggests that he values happiness and enjoyment. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (C) being happy. The other options, such as injuries, glee, and jumping, do not necessarily align with the idea of having fun. Smiling could be a possible answer, but it is not as strong as being happy, which encompasses a broader range of positive emotions."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find an office worker gossiping with their colleagues?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) water cooler (B) space shuttle (C) baby shower (D) bus stop (E) family", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. water cooler\nExplanation: The water cooler is a common gathering spot in offices where employees take breaks and chat with their colleagues. It is a place where office workers can catch up on the latest news and gossip, making it the most plausible answer. The other options, such as space shuttle, baby shower, bus stop, and family, are not typical places where office workers would gather to gossip."}}
{"Q": "Where would you put nails if they are already packaged?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pocket (B) container (C) cabinet (D) jar (E) store", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Container\nExplanation: If the nails are already packaged, it would be best to put them in a container to keep them organized and prevent them from spilling or getting lost. A pocket would not be secure enough, a cabinet or jar may not be the appropriate size, and \"store\" is not a specific location."}}
{"Q": "What is a person who is good at sports considered?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) lazy (B) own house (C) talented (D) affluent (E) reproduce", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. talented\nExplanation: A person who is good at sports is typically considered talented, as they have developed a skill and ability in a particular physical activity. The other answer choices (lazy, own house, affluent, reproduce) do not accurately describe someone who is good at sports."}}
{"Q": "The man acted ridiculous at the funeral, what attitude should he have taken?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) straightforward (B) serious (C) solemn (D) somber (E) funny", "R": {"text": "Answer: (C) solemn\nExplanation: The man's behavior at a funeral should have been respectful and serious. The appropriate attitude would be solemn, showing respect for the deceased and their family. Acting funny or ridiculous would be inappropriate and disrespectful. Therefore, option (C) solemn is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The pencil sharpener was broken in the classroom, where did the teacher recommend the student go?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) home (B) library (C) stationery store (D) cabinet (E) desk drawer", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. stationery store.\nExplanation: Since the pencil sharpener in the classroom is broken, the teacher would likely recommend the student to go to a place where they can buy a new one. The most plausible option from the given choices is a stationery store, where they can find a variety of school supplies including pencil sharpeners. Going home or searching in a desk drawer or cabinet would not be practical solutions, and the library would not have a pencil sharpener available for purchase."}}
{"Q": "Where does a child likely sit at a desk?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) furniture store (B) schoolroom (C) patio (D) office building (E) library", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. schoolroom\nExplanation: A child is most likely to sit at a desk in a schoolroom, where they attend classes and complete schoolwork. Furniture stores, patios, office buildings, and libraries may have desks, but they are not typically used by children for studying or learning."}}
{"Q": "He was trying to procreate with many individuals, this led to a what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) moaning (B) die (C) kiss (D) std (E) sanity", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Trying to procreate with many individuals without protection can lead to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This is a serious health risk and can have long-term consequences. It is important to practice safe sex and get tested regularly to prevent the spread of STDs."}}
{"Q": "What does playing soccer and winning lead to?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) excitement (B) getting tired (C) overtime (D) anger (E) fights", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. excitement.\nExplanation: Playing soccer and winning can lead to excitement as it is a competitive sport and winning can bring a sense of accomplishment and joy to the players and fans. While there may be some instances of overtime or even fights, these are not the most likely outcomes of playing soccer and winning. Getting tired is also a possibility, but it is not a direct result of winning. Anger is also not a likely outcome, unless there are unsportsmanlike behaviors or unfair play involved."}}
{"Q": "What attraction is sometimes so large that you need a map to find your way around?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) amusement park (B) truck stop (C) mcdonalds (D) backpack (E) classroom", "R": {"text": "Answer: Amusement park.\nExplanation: Amusement parks are often very large and have many different attractions, rides, and areas to explore. It is not uncommon for visitors to need a map to navigate their way around and find the specific attractions they want to visit. Truck stops, McDonald's, backpacks, and classrooms are not typically large enough to require a map for navigation."}}
{"Q": "If my husband never helps me doing housework, what might that lead to?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) boredom (B) arguments (C) headache (D) exhaustion (E) park", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. arguments\nExplanation: If one partner is consistently not contributing to household chores, it can lead to resentment and frustration in the other partner.

They are often used by advertisers to grab the attention of website visitors and promote their products or services. While advertisements can also appear in other forms such as emails or on buses, the use of the term \"pop-up\" suggests that the advertisement appeared on a web page."}}
{"Q": "WHere do people live?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) apartment (B) eat cake (C) bus depot (D) football stadium (E) surface of earth", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) apartment\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (A) apartment because it is a common type of housing for people. Many people live in apartments in cities and urban areas where space is limited and housing costs are high. Apartments offer a convenient and affordable option for people who want to live in the city and be close to work, shopping, and entertainment. The other choices, such as (B) eat cake, (C) bus depot, and (D) football stadium, are not places where people typically live. (E) surface of earth is a broad and vague answer, as people can live in various types of housing on the surface of the earth, including houses, apartments, condos, and more."}}
{"Q": "People are what when you're a stranger?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) train (B) strange (C) human (D) stupid (E) dangerous", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. strange\nExplanation: The lyrics of the song \"People Are Strange\" by The Doors include the line \"People are strange when you're a stranger.\" The word \"strange\" fits the context of the song and the idea that people can seem unfamiliar or unusual when you don't know them well."}}
{"Q": "The juror was quite bored and zoning out but wanted to convey he was hearing testimony, so he just sat there doing what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) take notes (B) nodding (C) change of heart (D) writing down (E) listening", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Nodding would be a more plausible answer as it conveys that the juror is paying attention and acknowledging the testimony being given, while also allowing them to appear engaged without having to actively participate or take notes."}}
{"Q": "They wanted to try blowfish, so they went to get some where?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) atlantic ocean (B) books (C) france (D) aquarium (E) fish market", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. fish market\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is E, fish market, as blowfish is a type of fish that is commonly sold in fish markets in Japan and other parts of Asia. It is considered a delicacy, but also potentially dangerous if not prepared correctly, as certain parts of the fish contain a deadly toxin. The other options, such as the Atlantic Ocean or France, do not necessarily have a direct connection to blowfish consumption. Books and aquariums may provide information about blowfish, but they would not be the place to obtain the actual fish for consumption."}}
{"Q": "When a main artery is used to expedite travel what would it be referred to as?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) neck (B) busy city (C) own brain (D) thruway (E) food", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. thruway\nExplanation: A thruway is a main artery or highway that is designed to expedite travel by providing a direct route with limited access points. It is often used for long-distance travel and can help drivers avoid busy city streets and traffic. The other options (neck, own brain, and food) do not make sense in the context of expedited travel on a main artery."}}
{"Q": "If someone rules the universe of what are they in charge?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) classroom (B) football game (C) everything (D) text book (E) lawbook", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. everything.\nExplanation: If someone rules the universe, they would be in charge of everything that exists within it, including classrooms, football games, textbooks, and lawbooks.

It was very what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) full (B) ample (C) covered (D) bareword (E) ample", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the butt was bare, so options (A) full, (B) ample, and (C) covered can be eliminated. Option (E) ample is a repetition of option (B) and can also be eliminated. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (D) bare, which directly describes the state of the butt in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Where can many stores with clothing be found?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) shop (B) mall (C) department store (D) drawer (E) library", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. mall\nExplanation: A mall is a large shopping center that typically has many stores selling clothing and other items. It is a more plausible answer compared to the other choices, such as a single shop or a drawer. A department store could also be a possible answer, but a mall typically has a wider variety of stores and brands. A library is not a plausible answer as it is not a place where clothing stores are typically found."}}
{"Q": "After working on the car, what did it end up doing?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) going too fast (B) last several years (C) honk the horn (D) go fast (E) start running", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. start running.\nExplanation: Since the question mentions \"working on the car,\" it is more likely that the car was not running before and the goal was to get it to start running again. Therefore, option E is the most plausible answer. The other options do not necessarily relate to the outcome of working on the car."}}
{"Q": "When an elderly person needs help performing daily tasks, who might they call?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) creativity (B) hatred (C) caregiver (D) own house (E) much money", "R": {"text": "Answer: Caregiver.\nExplanation: When an elderly person needs help performing daily tasks, they might call a caregiver. A caregiver is a trained professional who provides assistance with activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, and meal preparation. They can also provide companionship and help with medication management. It is a more plausible answer than creativity, hatred, own house, or much money, as these options do not provide any practical assistance for daily tasks."}}
{"Q": "Where is beer drank by people watching sticks and pucks?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bottle (B) refrigerator (C) hockey game (D) casino (E) bar", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. bar\nExplanation: People often drink beer while watching hockey games, and the most common place to do so is at a bar. While beer can be consumed from a bottle or stored in a refrigerator, these options do not necessarily indicate where the beer is being consumed. A casino may also serve alcohol, but it is not typically associated with watching hockey games."}}
{"Q": "Where is there a telephone book in almost every room?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) at hotel (B) house (C) library (D) bedsit (E) closet", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. at hotel\nExplanation: Hotels often provide telephone books in almost every room for the convenience of their guests.

{"Q": "Where might you see a green field while driving?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) kansas (B) meadow (C) farmland (D) countryside (E) rural area", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. countryside\nExplanation: The countryside is often characterized by vast green fields, making it the most plausible answer. While meadows and farmland may also have green fields, they are more specific and limited in scope. Kansas and rural areas may have green fields, but they are not necessarily a defining feature of those locations."}}
{"Q": "Some people got escorted out of the library, they were probably what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) state facts (B) talking loudly (C) making money (D) amount to nothing (E) believe in god", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. talking loudly.\nExplanation: The fact that they were escorted out of the library suggests that they were causing a disturbance. Talking loudly is a common reason for being asked to leave a library, as it can disrupt other patrons who are trying to study or read. The other options (A, C, D, E) do not seem as likely based on the information given."}}
{"Q": "If there is a pond with trees around it, where it it likely located?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) ground (B) bathroom (C) forest (D) countryside (E) rural area", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. countryside\nExplanation: A pond with trees around it is a common feature in the countryside, where there is more open space and natural surroundings. It is unlikely to be found in a bathroom or on the ground in an urban area. While it could be in a forest, the presence of trees alone does not necessarily indicate a forest environment. A rural area is also a plausible option, but the term \"countryside\" more specifically describes the setting of a pond with trees around it."}}
{"Q": "Blowfish require what specific thing to live?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sea water (B) hatred (C) fish market (D) body of water (E) jungle", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. body of water.\nExplanation: Blowfish are marine animals and require a body of water to live. They cannot survive in a jungle or a fish market. While sea water is important for their survival, it is not the only thing they require. Hatred is not a requirement for their survival. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D. body of water."}}
{"Q": "What is the least likely immediate side effect of eating hamburger?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) nausea (B) death (C) illness (D) health problems (E) gain weight", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) death\nExplanation: While it is possible for contaminated hamburger to cause illness or health problems, and consuming too much of it could lead to weight gain, death is an extremely unlikely immediate side effect of eating hamburger. It would require an extreme allergic reaction or the presence of a deadly toxin in the meat, which is highly unlikely in a properly cooked and prepared hamburger."}}
{"Q": "What would I be doing while going to work and walking?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) listen to radio (B) solve problems (C) driving (D) walk (E) being late", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. listen to radio.\nExplanation: While going to work and walking, it is common for people to listen to the radio to catch up on news, music, or entertainment. This can help pass the time and make the commute more enjoyable. Solving problems or driving would not be applicable if the person is walking, and being late is not a productive activity."}}
{"Q": "A showroom feature washers and refrigerators, where is this showroom located?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) appliance store (B) vegas (C) electronics store (D) car dealership (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Appliance store.\nExplanation: It is common for appliance stores to feature washers and refrigerators in their showrooms as they specialize in selling household appliances. Vegas, electronics stores, car dealerships, and kitchens are not typically associated with selling washers and refrigerators."}}
{"Q": "The man often made smart remarks, like that any restaurant is a mexican restaurant where?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) city (B) mexica (C) san diego (D) spain (E) mexico", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) city\nExplanation: The statement \"any restaurant is a Mexican restaurant\" is a play on words, implying that Mexican cuisine is so popular and widespread that it can be found in any type of restaurant. This statement could apply to any city, not just Mexico or San Diego. Therefore, (A) city is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I am looking for honey right from the source, where should I look?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) last all night (B) beehive (C) farmer's market (D) jar (E) honeyful", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) beehive\nExplanation: The most direct source of honey would be the beehive, where the honey is produced by the bees. One can either purchase honey directly from a beekeeper or visit a local apiary to observe the process of honey production. The other options, such as last all night, jar, honeyful, or farmer's market, may refer to honey products but not necessarily the raw honey straight from the source."}}
{"Q": "Where are there likely to be a variety of flats to choose from?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) london (B) apartment building (C) city (D) falling down (E) town", "R": {"text": "Answer: London.\nExplanation: London is a large city with a diverse range of neighborhoods and housing options, including flats. There are many different types of flats available in London, from modern high-rise apartments to traditional Victorian conversions. Additionally, London is a popular destination for renters and buyers alike, so there is likely to be a wide variety of flats to choose from in different price ranges and locations."}}
{"Q": "A weasel has a thin body and short legs to easier burrow after prey in a what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) tree (B) mulberry bush (C) chicken coop (D) viking ship (E) rabbit warren", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. rabbit warren\nExplanation: Weasels are known for their ability to burrow and chase prey underground. A rabbit warren provides the perfect environment for a weasel to hunt and catch rabbits, which are a common prey for weasels. The other options, such as a tree or viking ship, do not provide the same type of environment for a weasel to hunt and catch prey."}}
{"Q": "What can disease destroy?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) rug (B) third world country (C) human body (D) hospital (E) building", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. human body\nExplanation: Diseases can attack and damage the human body, leading to illness, disability, and even death. While diseases can also have an impact on other things like hospitals and buildings, the destruction of the human body is the most significant and devastating consequence of disease."}}
{"Q": "What does a person from Avalon live in?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) pain (B) meaningful work (C) english house (D) cotton candy (E) headache", "R": {"text": "Answer: English house.\nExplanation: Avalon is a legendary island in Arthurian legend, often associated with the British Isles. Therefore, it is likely that a person from Avalon would live in an English house, which is a common type of housing in the UK. The other options (pain, meaningful work, cotton candy, headache) do not make sense as a place to live in."}}
{"Q": "Where is one likely to find a fan for their stove?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) appliance store (B) sports stadium (C) dress emporium (D) hot room (E) football stadium", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Appliance store.\nExplanation: A fan for a stove is a household appliance and can be found in an appliance store. The other options, such as a sports stadium, dress emporium, hot room, or football stadium, are not relevant to finding a fan for a stove."}}
{"Q": "Jodie felt a tightness in her chest. She was worried but didn't want to go to the hospital. Where might she go instead?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) istanbul (B) concert (C) bedroom (D) antique shop (E) human being", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. bedroom\nExplanation: If Jodie is feeling a tightness in her chest, it could be a sign of a medical emergency. However, if she is hesitant to go to the hospital, she could go to her bedroom to rest and monitor her symptoms. She could also call a doctor or a medical helpline for advice on what to do next. Going to Istanbul, a concert, or an antique shop would not address her medical concerns, and a human being is not a location or a place to seek medical attention."}}
{"Q": "If you're buying beer for a float trip what are you preparing to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) get arrested (B) have fun (C) get sick (D) spend money (E) stupidity", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) have fun.\nExplanation: Buying beer for a float trip typically means that you are preparing to have a fun time floating down a river or stream with friends or family. While excessive drinking can lead to getting sick or making poor decisions, the act of buying beer for a float trip itself does not necessarily imply that. Therefore, (B) have fun is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Piece of land in Canada where you can find marmot?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) north america (B) united states (C) vancouver island (D) american (E) cage", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. Vancouver Island.\nExplanation: Vancouver Island is a large island off the west coast of Canada and is known for its diverse wildlife, including the Vancouver Island marmot, which is an endangered species found only on the island. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer among the given choices."}}
{"Q": "The surgeon's clients had begun to reduce, it seemed girls no longer want to what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) reduction (B) make larger (C) augment (D) gain weight (E) expand", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. augment\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the surgeon's clients had begun to reduce, which means that they were no longer interested in getting a reduction surgery. The word \"seemed\" indicates that this is an observation or perception of the surgeon. The only option that fits this context is \"augment,\" which means to make something larger or increase its size. Therefore, it can be inferred that the girls were no longer interested in getting breast augmentation surgery."}}
{"Q": "While waiting for this appointment, people often read magazines.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) doctor (B) train station (C) newsagent (D) market (E) table", "R": {"text": "Answer: Doctor.\nExplanation: People often read magazines while waiting for their turn at the doctor's office. It is a common practice to pass the time and distract oneself from the anxiety of the appointment. Train stations and newsagents may also have magazines, but they are not specifically associated with waiting for an appointment. Markets and tables are unlikely places to find magazines for reading while waiting."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a fox that is made up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) storybook (B) woods (C) hen house (D) natural habitat (E) back yard", "R": {"text": "Answer: Storybook.\nExplanation: A fox that is made up is likely to be found in a storybook, as it is a fictional creation. It is not likely to be found in the woods, natural habitat, or back yard as those are real-life locations. It is also not likely to be found in a hen house as foxes are known to prey on chickens and would not be welcome in that location. Therefore, the most plausible answer is storybook."}}
{"Q": "In basic training they build you up only to do what, all in hopes of building you up even stronger the next time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) destroying (B) tear down (C) raze (D) mutilate (E) demolition", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. tear down\nExplanation: Basic training is designed to break down the recruits mentally and physically in order to build them up stronger and more disciplined. The phrase \"tear down\" is a more appropriate choice as it implies breaking down in order to rebuild, rather than completely destroying or mutilating."}}
{"Q": "Billy saw a dog running from him and did his best to get away from it.  The leaped up to where the dog couldn't reach and was stuck.  Where might he have been trapped?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) kennel (B) table (C) porch (D) backyard (E) park", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) table\nExplanation: If Billy leaped up to where the dog couldn't reach him, it is likely that he climbed onto a higher surface. Out of the given choices, a table is the most plausible option for a higher surface that a person could climb onto to escape a dog. The other options, such as a kennel or backyard, do not provide a clear explanation for how Billy could have become stuck."}}
{"Q": "John and Judy were parents.  They had two wonderful kids who weren't always well behaved.  They were light tough, though.  They felt it was a parent's job to do what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) control children (B) guide children (C) speak freely (D) cry (E) understand children", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: John and Judy believed that it was their job as parents to guide their children, which suggests that they were focused on helping their children learn and grow rather than simply controlling them. While discipline and boundaries are important, guidance is a more positive and proactive approach to parenting."}}
{"Q": "What are you playing if you're fiddling on a violin?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bluegrass music (B) make music (C) drop (D) string instrument (E) troubles", "R": {"text": "Answer: String instrument.\nExplanation: Fiddling on a violin means playing a string instrument, specifically a violin. While bluegrass music is often associated with the violin, it is not the only genre that uses this instrument. \"Make music\" is too broad and does not specifically refer to playing a violin. \"Drop\" and \"troubles\" are not related to playing a violin at all."}}
{"Q": "If somebody buys something and gives it to me as a free gift, what is the cost status of the gift?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) deadly (B) imprisoned (C) paid for (D) expensive (E) in prison", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: If somebody buys something and gives it to me as a free gift, it means that the item has already been paid for by the giver. Therefore, the cost status of the gift is \"paid for.\" The other options such as \"deadly,\" \"imprisoned,\" \"expensive,\" and \"in prison\" do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Why does someone flirt with many people at once?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) have sex (B) get laid (C) were lonely (D) attract attention (E) dance", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) attract attention.\nExplanation: Some people may flirt with many people at once to feel desired and attract attention. It could be a way to boost their self-esteem or feel more confident. It doesn't necessarily mean they want to have sex or get laid, but rather they enjoy the attention and validation from flirting."}}
{"Q": "James tore the antenna off of his boat due to bad reception as he was crossing the channel from France.  Where was he going?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) river (B) television (C) india (D) england (E) europe", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Since James was crossing the channel from France, it is likely that he was heading towards England, which is separated from France by the English Channel. The other choices (river, television, India, and Europe) do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Why would a band be performing when there are no people nearby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) record album (B) play music (C) hold concert (D) blaring (E) practice", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. practice\nExplanation: It is common for bands to practice their music even when there is no audience present. This allows them to perfect their performance and work on any areas that need improvement."}}
{"Q": "The dogs were protecting their own when they decided to what the bad man?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) bad breath (B) defend (C) run fast (D) ocean (E) attack", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. defend\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the dogs were protecting something that belonged to them, which implies that they were defending it. Option E, attack, is also a possibility, but it is not the only one. Option A, bad breath, and option D, ocean, are completely unrelated to the sentence, while option C, run fast, does not make sense in the context. Therefore, option B, defend, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What is used to grind wheat for bread?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) farmer's field (B) countryside (C) cereal packets (D) bread (E) mill", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. mill\nExplanation: Wheat is typically ground into flour using a mill, which grinds the wheat berries into a fine powder. This flour is then used to make bread dough, which is baked into bread. While wheat is grown in farmer's fields in order to produce the wheat berries, and bread is the end product of the baking process, neither of these options involve the actual grinding of the wheat into flour. Cereal packets may contain wheat-based cereals, but these are already processed and do not require further grinding. The countryside is a general term for rural areas and is not directly related to the process of grinding wheat for bread."}}
{"Q": "If you have a large satchel with you when you fly you'll be asked to store it where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) airport (B) luggage compartment (C) with the pilot (D) room (E) clothing store", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. luggage compartment\nExplanation: When flying, passengers are typically allowed to bring one carry-on bag and one personal item, such as a purse or small backpack. If a passenger has a large satchel that exceeds the size limit for a personal item, they will be asked to store it in the luggage compartment above their seat or in the overhead bins. This is a common practice on airplanes to ensure that there is enough space for all passengers' belongings and to maintain safety during the flight."}}
{"Q": "Where would someone keep their nylon leggings?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) stockings (B) rope (C) car (D) clothing (E) drawer", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. drawer\nExplanation: Nylon leggings are a type of clothing item, so it would make sense for someone to keep them in a clothing drawer. Stockings are a similar type of clothing item, but they are typically made of a different material and have a different style than leggings. Rope and a car are not logical places to store clothing items."}}
{"Q": "If you spend a long time running after a ball how are you likely to feel?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) laughter (B) sweating (C) embarrassed (D) breathing heavily (E) tiredness", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. tiredness\nExplanation: Running after a ball for a long time requires physical exertion and can lead to fatigue and tiredness. Laughter and embarrassment may occur in certain situations, but they are not the most likely outcomes of prolonged physical activity. Sweating and breathing heavily are also possible, but they are more immediate physical responses rather than long-term effects."}}
{"Q": "When you need to rest it's often because you have been doing what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) action (B) sleep (C) sleeping (D) in motion (E) using energy", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: When you need to rest, it's often because you have been using energy. This can be physical energy from activities such as exercise or manual labor, or mental energy from tasks such as studying or problem-solving. Rest allows the body and mind to recover and replenish the energy that has been used."}}
{"Q": "Boredom and hunger led to a wandering waste of time and a cart full of unhealthy snacks during her trip to where?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) new moon (B) play cards (C) read book (D) see art (E) grocery shop", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. grocery shop\nExplanation: The mention of a \"cart full of unhealthy snacks\" suggests that the person was in a place where they could purchase food items. Among the given options, only grocery shopping fits this description. The other options do not involve the possibility of buying snacks or food items."}}
{"Q": "He was beginning to worry they wouldn't get on the ride before closing, they had been standing in queue for a long what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) frustration (B) waiting (C) hair (D) time (E) patience", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (D) time, as the sentence mentions that they had been standing in queue for a long time and the worry is that they wouldn't get on the ride before closing. The other options (A) frustration, (B) waiting, (C) hair, and (E) patience may be related to the situation, but they do not directly answer the question of what they had been standing in queue for a long time for."}}
{"Q": "This is an unavoidable physiological consequence of running.  What is it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) breathlessness (B) increased heart rate (C) falling down (D) muscle bulk (E) calluses", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Breathlessness is an unavoidable physiological consequence of running as it requires increased oxygen intake to meet the demands of the working muscles. This leads to an increase in breathing rate and depth, which can result in breathlessness. Increased heart rate is also a common consequence of running, but it is not necessarily unavoidable as it can be influenced by factors such as fitness level and intensity of exercise. Falling down is not a physiological consequence of running, but rather a potential risk or accident. Muscle bulk can be a desired outcome of running for some individuals, but it is not an unavoidable consequence. Calluses may develop on the feet due to friction and pressure from running, but they are not a physiological consequence of running in the same sense as breathlessness or increased heart rate."}}
{"Q": "Sometimes a person has a fear of water or a dislike of being wet, it is still important to make sure they are having a bath why?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) flooding (B) drowning (C) wet skin (D) get wet (E) rash", "R": {"text": "Answer: (E) rash\nExplanation: Even if a person has a fear of water or a dislike of being wet, it is still important to make sure they are having a bath to prevent the buildup of bacteria and dirt on their skin, which can lead to rashes and other skin irritations. Regular bathing is an important part of maintaining good hygiene and overall health."}}
{"Q": "Where would there be an auditorium with only a single person speaking?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) lights (B) crowd (C) university campus (D) theater (E) park", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. theater.\nExplanation: A theater is a venue specifically designed for performances, including plays, concerts, and lectures. It is common for a single person, such as a speaker or performer, to be on stage speaking to an audience in a theater. The other options, such as lights, park, or university campus, do not typically have an auditorium or a stage for a single person to speak to an audience. A crowd could gather in any of these locations, but it would not necessarily be in an auditorium setting."}}
{"Q": "To get out of there the person had to keep on walking, they had to keep on what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) moving forward (B) locomotion (C) blisters (D) rollerskate (E) exercise", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. moving forward.\nExplanation: The phrase \"keep on walking\" implies that the person needs to continue moving in order to get out of there. Option A, \"moving forward,\" is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the action of walking and progressing towards an exit. Options B, C, D, and E are not as relevant or logical in this context."}}
{"Q": "What very large group of western citizens has bees everywhere?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) united states (B) space station (C) trash can (D) field of flowers (E) bouquet of flowers", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. United States.\nExplanation: Bees are found all over the world, but the United States has a particularly large population of bees due to its vast agricultural industry and the importance of bees in pollinating crops. Additionally, many individuals and organizations in the US keep bees as a hobby or for honey production. Therefore, it is more plausible that the very large group of western citizens with bees everywhere is the United States."}}
{"Q": "Miss Grady took a stick from Bob because he was playing with it during class.  She wanted to make sure that he couldn't get to it so she put it where?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) desk drawer (B) kitchen drawer (C) classroom (D) pocket (E) office", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. classroom\nExplanation: Since Miss Grady took the stick from Bob during class, it is more plausible that she would have put it somewhere within the classroom where she could keep an eye on it and return it to Bob at the end of class. Putting it in a desk drawer or kitchen drawer (options A and B) would not make sense in a classroom setting. Keeping it in her pocket (option D) would not be practical or safe, and putting it in her office (option E) would require her to leave the classroom, which would not be ideal during class time."}}
{"Q": "How does a person begin reproducing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) genetic mutation (B) have sex (C) kiss (D) flirting (E) going on a date", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Have sex.\nExplanation: Reproduction in humans typically begins with sexual intercourse between a male and a female, which allows for the fertilization of an egg by a sperm. This process leads to the formation of a zygote, which will eventually develop into a fetus and result in the birth of a new individual. While genetic mutations can occur during the process of reproduction, they are not the initial step in the process. Kissing and flirting may be part of the courtship process that leads to sexual intercourse, but they are not necessary for reproduction to occur. Going on a date is also not a necessary step in the process of reproduction, although it may be part of the social and cultural context in which reproduction occurs."}}
{"Q": "Joe and Jill didn't want their children to be sedentary.  They might limit the time they children spend doing what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) play sports (B) throw things (C) reading (D) watch tv (E) play with toys", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Joe and Jill didn't want their children to be sedentary, which means they didn't want their children to be inactive or spend too much time sitting. Watching TV is a sedentary activity, so it is the most plausible answer. Playing sports, throwing things, reading, and playing with toys all involve some level of physical activity and would not necessarily make the children sedentary."}}
{"Q": "They were making sauerkraut, the instructor explained the liquid should be above the cabbage in the what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) jar (B) drinking glass (C) pot (D) container (E) can", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. container\nExplanation: Sauerkraut is typically made in a container such as a crock or a large glass jar. The liquid, which is usually a mixture of salt and water, should be above the cabbage to ensure that the fermentation process occurs properly. A drinking glass or can would be too small for making sauerkraut, and a pot may not be the best option as it may not have a lid to keep out air and prevent contamination. Therefore, a container is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "From where would you normally take a cup when you're about to get a drink?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) dishwasher (B) water fountain (C) sand box (D) toilet (E) kitchen cabinet", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. kitchen cabinet\nExplanation: It is common to take a cup from the kitchen cabinet when you want to get a drink. The other options, such as the dishwasher, water fountain, sand box, and toilet, are not appropriate places to take a cup from for drinking."}}
{"Q": "What are you using if there are speakers strapped on your ears?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) take it all in (B) headphones (C) desktop (D) conference (E) concert", "R": {"text": "Answer: Headphones.\nExplanation: If there are speakers strapped on your ears, it is most likely that you are using headphones. Headphones are a type of audio equipment that are worn over the ears to listen to music or other audio content without disturbing others."}}
{"Q": "Because of his anger he couldn't clearly explain or what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cool off (B) write letter (C) get mad (D) illustrate point (E) destroy enemy", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. cool off\nExplanation: When someone is angry, it can be difficult for them to communicate effectively and clearly. Taking a break to cool off and calm down can help them regain their composure and approach the situation with a clearer mind. This can lead to better communication and a more productive outcome. Writing a letter or illustrating a point may also be helpful, but they should be done after the person has had a chance to cool off and collect their thoughts. Getting even angrier or trying to destroy an enemy will only escalate the situation and make it worse."}}
{"Q": "Where is likely to not just have a kosher restaurant?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) jerusalem (B) jewish neighborhoods (C) dining in (D) new york city (E) dining", "R": {"text": "Answer: Dining in.\nExplanation: It is possible to find kosher options in many restaurants, especially in areas with a large Jewish population like Jewish neighborhoods and New York City. Jerusalem is also known for its abundance of kosher restaurants. However, the option \"dining in\" is not a specific location and therefore cannot be considered a likely place to find a kosher restaurant."}}
{"Q": "The bald eagle flew from Mount St Helen's to the Puget Sound and all over what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) washington state (B) utah (C) pacific northwest (D) northern california (E) the desert", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. Pacific Northwest.\nExplanation: The bald eagle is a bird of prey commonly found in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which includes Washington state. It is unlikely that the eagle would fly all the way to Utah, Northern California, or the desert, making option A, D, and E less plausible. Therefore, option C, Pacific Northwest, is the most likely answer."}}
{"Q": "Where could you get some knives if you are planning to bring them outside with you?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sporting goods store (B) backpack (C) kitchen (D) sharp edges (E) dog house", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. sporting goods store\nExplanation: Sporting goods stores often sell knives that are suitable for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and hunting. These knives are designed to be durable and reliable in outdoor environments. It is important to choose a knife that is appropriate for your intended use and to follow all safety guidelines when handling and carrying knives."}}
{"Q": "How can people fulfill their own calorie requirements?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) compete with each other (B) feed themselves (C) feel lonely (D) talk to each other (E) ask a doctor", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Feed themselves.\nExplanation: People can fulfill their own calorie requirements by feeding themselves with a balanced diet that includes the necessary amount of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. This can be achieved by consuming a variety of foods from different food groups in appropriate portions. Competing with others, feeling lonely, talking to others, or asking a doctor may not directly contribute to fulfilling one's calorie requirements."}}
{"Q": "What does a stove do to the place that it's in?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) cool house (B) warm room (C) gas or electric (D) burn child (E) brown meat", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. warm room\nExplanation: A stove is designed to generate heat and cook food, so it will warm up the room it is in. It is not designed to cool a house, burn a child, or brown meat (although it can be used for that purpose). The choice of gas or electric refers to the type of fuel used to power the stove, but it does not describe the effect the stove has on the room."}}
{"Q": "What is the best way to begin going into trance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) religious experience (B) closed eyes (C) loss of control (D) sleep (E) hallucination", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Closed eyes.\nExplanation: Closing your eyes is a common and effective way to begin going into trance. By eliminating visual distractions, you can focus on your internal experience and allow yourself to relax and enter a trance state. This can be done through meditation, hypnosis, or other techniques that encourage relaxation and suggestibility. While religious experiences, loss of control, sleep, and hallucinations can also lead to trance states, they are not as reliable or accessible for most people."}}
{"Q": "A computer user working on an important work assignment is located in what structure?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) office building (B) internet cafe (C) house (D) school (E) internet cafe", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. office building\nExplanation: An office building is the most plausible answer as it is a common location for professionals to work on important assignments. It provides a professional environment with necessary equipment and resources to complete work efficiently. A house or school may also be possible locations, but an office building is the most likely option. An internet cafe may not be a suitable location for an important work assignment as it may not provide a quiet and professional environment."}}
{"Q": "The music was festive but why are the horses dancing in circles", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) carnival (B) night club (C) theatre (D) opera (E) ringmaster", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. carnival\nExplanation: Horses dancing in circles is a common sight in carnivals and circuses where they are trained to perform tricks and entertain the audience. The festive music also supports the idea of a carnival atmosphere. Night clubs, theatres, and operas are unlikely places for horses to dance, and a ringmaster is a person who directs and introduces acts in a circus or carnival, not a location where horses would dance."}}
{"Q": "In the building where James worked there was a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats.  Where might James work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) theater (B) floors (C) concert hall (D) education (E) school", "R": {"text": "Answer: A (theater)\nExplanation: The mention of an auditorium and the addition of a mezzanine to create more seating space suggests that James works in a theater. The other options, such as floors, education, or school, do not typically have auditoriums or mezzanines for seating arrangements. A concert hall is a possibility, but the mention of a small mezzanine suggests a smaller venue like a theater."}}
{"Q": "If you aren't well rested and it's a rainy day what might you do?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) sleep (B) write (C) make bread (D) stay in bed (E) enjoy film", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. \nExplanation: If you aren't well rested and it's a rainy day, it may be tempting to sleep or stay in bed, but that may not necessarily help you feel more energized. Writing or making bread may require too much mental or physical effort. Enjoying a film, on the other hand, can be a relaxing and low-energy activity that can help you pass the time and distract you from any fatigue or gloomy weather."}}
{"Q": "Where would you have a stove if you don't live in a detached dwelling?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) tent (B) car (C) living room (D) friend's house (E) apartment", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. apartment\nExplanation: If you don't live in a detached dwelling, the most plausible option for having a stove would be in an apartment. Tents and cars are not typically equipped with stoves, and it would be unusual to have a stove in a living room or a friend's house unless it was a detached dwelling."}}
{"Q": "What kind of place has a revolving door and has things to buy in it?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) new york (B) public place (C) bank (D) mall (E) supermarket door", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. mall\nExplanation: A mall typically has a revolving door at its entrance and various stores where customers can buy things. While other options like New York or a public place may have revolving doors, they do not necessarily have things to buy inside. A bank may have a revolving door, but it is unlikely to have a variety of things to buy inside. A supermarket door may have things to buy inside, but it typically does not have a revolving door. Therefore, a mall is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where can books be read?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cabinet (B) backpack (C) table (D) shelf (E) sink", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. table\nExplanation: Books can be read on a table, which provides a flat surface for the book to rest on and allows the reader to sit comfortably.

{"Q": "If a lizard is fed by people every day, what has happened to it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) documentary (B) costa rica (C) garden (D) encouragement (E) captivity", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. captivity\nExplanation: If a lizard is being fed by people every day, it is likely that it has become accustomed to human presence and is living in an environment where it is dependent on humans for food. This suggests that the lizard is being kept in captivity, either intentionally or unintentionally."}}
{"Q": "What will happen to someone if his or her spirits cannot elevate?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sadden (B) demote (C) depress (D) drop (E) decrease", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. depress.\nExplanation: If someone's spirits cannot elevate, it means they are unable to feel happy or positive.

{"Q": "If you wanted a license to catch crabs, what government office would you go to?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) most offices (B) fish department (C) fancy restaurant (D) government submarine (E) chesapeake bay", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. fish department\nExplanation: The fish department is responsible for regulating and managing fishing activities, including the issuance of licenses for crabbing. This office would have the necessary information and resources to provide a license for catching crabs. The other options are not relevant to obtaining a crabbing license."}}
{"Q": "What furniture will you normally find near a side chair?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) bedroom (B) table (C) wheel barrow (D) building (E) office", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. table\nExplanation: A side chair is typically used for seating in a living room or sitting area, and it is common to find a small table or end table nearby for placing drinks, books, or other items. A bedroom may have a side chair as well, but it would likely be paired with a vanity or dresser rather than a table. A wheelbarrow and building are not typically associated with side chairs, and while an office may have a side chair, it would likely be paired with a desk rather than a table."}}
{"Q": "Metal is used to make what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) junkyard (B) ore (C) instruments (D) metal fabrication shop (E) bowls", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. instruments\nExplanation: Metal is commonly used to make musical instruments such as guitars, drums, and trumpets. While it can also be used for other purposes like creating a metal fabrication shop or bowls, these options are less common and specific than the use of metal in instrument-making. Junkyards are places where scrap metal is collected, and ore is a raw material that must be processed before it can be used to make metal products."}}
{"Q": "What is the word added to Manchester that signifies what county it is in?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) england (B) united kingdome (C) lancashire (D) greater manchester (E) cheshire", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The word added to Manchester that signifies what county it is in is \"Lancashire.\" Manchester is a city in the county of Lancashire, located in the northwest region of England."}}

Compiling and writing code are not relevant actions for an end user who is experiencing errors in a program."}}
{"Q": "John knew that the sun produced a massive amount of energy in two forms.  If you were on the surface of the sun, what would kill you first?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) ocean (B) heat (C) life on earth (D) wrinkles (E) light", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If you were on the surface of the sun, the extreme heat would kill you first. The temperature on the surface of the sun is around 5,500 degrees Celsius, which is hot enough to vaporize most materials. The heat would cause your body to quickly disintegrate, making it impossible to survive for even a few seconds."}}
{"Q": "Lawyers often talk in front of an audience where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) work (B) courtroom (C) office building (D) press charges (E) theatre", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. courtroom\nExplanation: Lawyers are often seen speaking in front of an audience in a courtroom, where they present their arguments and defend their clients. This is a common setting for legal proceedings and trials. While lawyers may also speak in other settings such as their office building or at work, the most likely scenario where they would address an audience is in a courtroom. Press charges and theatre are not relevant to this context."}}
{"Q": "James bought a new set of tire chains and put them somewhere he could find them.  Where would he put them?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) gear shift (B) garage (C) kitchen (D) jewelry store (E) hardware store", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: James would most likely put his new set of tire chains in his garage, where he stores his car and other automotive equipment. It would be the most logical and convenient place to keep them for when he needs to use them."}}
{"Q": "If I wanted to eat something that is made from plants and needs to be washed, what would it be?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) roots (B) millions of cells (C) see work (D) leaves to gather light (E) flowers on", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. leaves to gather light.\nExplanation: Leaves are a common plant part that needs to be washed before consumption. They are often used in salads, sandwiches, and as a garnish. Roots (A) may also need to be washed, but they are not typically eaten raw. Millions of cells (B) and see work (C) are not specific enough to be a plausible answer. Flowers (E) may be edible, but they are not commonly washed before consumption."}}
{"Q": "Ficus can be planted in a yard to make summer more bearable, what sort of areas do they create?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) shady places (B) screened porch (C) pots (D) ceramics (E) clay pot", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Ficus trees are known for their ability to provide shade, making them a popular choice for planting in yards. They have large, dense foliage that can block out the sun and create a cool, comfortable area to relax in during the hot summer months. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (A) shady places. Choices (B) screened porch, (C) pots, (D) ceramics, and (E) clay pot are not relevant to the question as they do not describe the areas created by planting Ficus trees in a yard."}}
{"Q": "Children's behavior is a direct reflection of their what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) parents (B) old people (C) play ball (D) many adults (E) grown ups", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. parents\nExplanation: Children's behavior is heavily influenced by their parents as they are their primary caregivers and role models. Parents have a significant impact on a child's upbringing, including their values, beliefs, and behavior. Children learn from their parents' actions and words, and they often mimic their behavior. Therefore, parents play a crucial role in shaping their children's behavior."}}

It is a way to show affection and closeness between family members. The other options, such as apartments, listening to music, having friends, and knowing about ophiolites, are not typically associated with family greetings."}}
{"Q": "John bought a new water hose.  But he found his old one near his car.  Where did he find the old one?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) garden shed (B) hardware store (C) greenhouse (D) garage (E) in a van", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: John most likely found his old water hose in his garage, as that is a common place to store outdoor equipment and tools. The other options (garden shed, greenhouse, hardware store, and in a van) are less likely as they are not typically places where one would store a water hose."}}
{"Q": "Where is a control room needed to prevent wide spread disaster?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) airbase (B) prison (C) mill (D) nuclear plant (E) recording studio", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. nuclear plant\nExplanation: A control room is needed in a nuclear plant to monitor and control the nuclear reactions and prevent any potential disasters such as a nuclear meltdown. The control room is responsible for monitoring the plant's systems, detecting any abnormalities, and taking corrective actions to prevent any accidents. Without a control room, a nuclear plant could pose a significant threat to public safety and the environment."}}
{"Q": "Where do you keep your pizza slice before you eat it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) table (B) plate (C) restaurant (D) oven (E) popular", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. plate\nExplanation: It is common practice to place a pizza slice on a plate before eating it. This allows for easier handling and prevents any toppings or grease from getting on the table or other surfaces. While a restaurant may provide a plate, it is not always guaranteed. Keeping a pizza slice in the oven or on a popular surface would not be practical or safe for consumption."}}
{"Q": "Everybody was changing into costumes in the dressing room, it was almost time to take the what stage?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) theater (B) train (C) bathhouse (D) dwelling (E) actors and actresses", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. theater\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that everyone was changing into costumes in a dressing room, which is typically associated with a theater or performance venue. The use of the word \"stage\" also supports this idea, as it is commonly used in the context of a theatrical production. The other options, such as train, bathhouse, dwelling, or actors and actresses, do not fit as well with the given context."}}
{"Q": "The homeowner frowned at the price of gas, what did he have to do later?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) own home (B) mail property tax payments (C) board windows (D) cut grass (E) receive mail", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The homeowner's frown at the price of gas suggests that he needs to use his car to do something, and cutting grass is a common household chore that requires the use of a lawnmower, which runs on gas. The other options (owning a home, mailing property tax payments, and boarding windows) do not necessarily require the use of a car or gas. Receiving mail is also unlikely to be related to the homeowner's frown at the price of gas."}}
{"Q": "A thoroughfare meandered through fields and woods, where was it passing though?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) move about (B) city (C) country (D) town (E) new york city", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. country.\nExplanation: The use of the words \"fields\" and \"woods\" suggest a rural or countryside setting, rather than an urban one. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (C) country."}}
{"Q": "If I want a new ottoman, where should I go?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) furniture store (B) parlor (C) turkey (D) living room (E) den", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. furniture store.\nExplanation: A furniture store is the most plausible option for purchasing a new ottoman. Ottomans are a common piece of furniture and can be found in most furniture stores. A parlor is a room in a house, not a place to buy furniture. Turkey is a country and not a place to buy furniture. Living room and den are rooms in a house, not places to buy furniture."}}
{"Q": "Sean was leaving work and took the roadway that led to his what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) neighborhood (B) city (C) fate (D) countryside (E) maps", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. neighborhood\nExplanation: Since Sean was leaving work, it is more likely that he would take the roadway that leads to his neighborhood, where he lives, rather than the roadway that leads to a city or countryside. The option of fate or maps does not make sense in this context. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What can you use to get a jellyfish?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) adriatic sea (B) mediterranean sea (C) hand (D) see (E) atlantic ocean", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. hand\nExplanation: Using your hand to catch a jellyfish is a plausible answer as it is a common method used by beachgoers and fishermen. The other choices are bodies of water where jellyfish can be found, but they do not provide a method for catching them."}}
{"Q": "What has a shelf that does not allow you to see what is inside of it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) chest of drawers (B) stove (C) hold alcohol (D) bookcase (E) grocery store", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. bookcase\nExplanation: A bookcase typically has shelves with books or other items stored on them, which can obscure the view of what is behind them. Unlike a chest of drawers or stove, which have drawers or doors that can be opened to reveal their contents, a bookcase is designed to display items on its shelves while also providing storage space. While a grocery store may have shelves that are difficult to see behind due to the amount of products stocked on them, it is not a single piece of furniture like a bookcase. Finally, while some types of alcohol may be stored in opaque containers, a shelf that specifically \"holds alcohol\" is not a common household item."}}
{"Q": "What will likely happen after stabbing to death a person?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) gruesome (B) being arrested (C) pool of blood (D) mess (E) grisly", "R": {"text": "Answer: Being arrested.\nExplanation: Stabbing someone to death is a serious crime and is punishable by law. The perpetrator will likely be arrested by the authorities and face legal consequences for their actions. While there may be a pool of blood and a mess at the crime scene, the most immediate and likely outcome is being arrested. The other choices, such as gruesome and grisly, describe the nature of the crime but do not necessarily indicate what will happen after the fact."}}
{"Q": "The boat passenger was explaining his fear of blowfish, but the captain figured he meant piranhas since they were on a river in the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) cuba (B) styx (C) atlantic ocean (D) france (E) jungle", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The fact that they are on a river suggests that they are in a jungle or rainforest area, making option E the most plausible choice. Piranhas are commonly found in rivers in South America, while blowfish are typically found in saltwater environments. Therefore, it is more likely that the passenger was referring to piranhas rather than blowfish."}}
{"Q": "Where could you find only a few office?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) skyscraper (B) new york (C) school building (D) city (E) work", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. school building\nExplanation: School buildings typically have only a few offices, such as the principal's office, guidance counselor's office, and administrative offices. Skyscrapers and cities, on the other hand, usually have many offices, while New York and work are too broad to determine the number of offices present."}}
{"Q": "Where can I go to be a religious gentleman?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) club (B) restaurant (C) university (D) pub (E) church", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. church\nExplanation: A church is a place of worship and is often associated with religious activities and gatherings. It is a more plausible option for someone looking to practice their faith and be a religious gentleman. The other options such as a club, restaurant, university, or pub do not necessarily have a religious connotation and may not provide the same environment for someone looking to be a religious gentleman."}}
{"Q": "I want to see a prepared slide up close, what would I use to help?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) microscope (B) abbreviate (C) glasses (D) camera (E) telescope", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. microscope\nExplanation: A microscope is the most appropriate tool for viewing a prepared slide up close. It allows for magnification and resolution of the specimen on the slide, making it easier to observe and study its details. Glasses, a camera, and a telescope are not suitable for this task, and abbreviate is not a tool but a verb meaning to shorten a word or phrase."}}
{"Q": "Where can you buy a magazine, paper or gum?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) bank (B) rack (C) bed (D) newsstand (E) bus depot", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. newsstand.\nExplanation: A newsstand is a common place to buy magazines, newspapers, and gum. Banks and bus depots may have small convenience stores that sell these items, but it is not their primary function. Racks could refer to magazine racks, but it is not clear where these racks would be located. Bed is not a plausible answer as it is not a place where these items are typically sold."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get some wood if you do not have any?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) carpet (B) boat (C) river (D) lumberyard (E) synagogue", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. lumberyard\nExplanation: A lumberyard is a place where wood is sold and can be easily obtained. Carpets, boats, and rivers do not provide wood, and a synagogue is a place of worship and not a source of wood."}}
{"Q": "The pitcher felt stress and tension on the mound, what did he feel like?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) desert (B) baseball field (C) hell (D) baseball diamond (E) baseball stadium", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. baseball diamond.\nExplanation: The pitcher is on the mound, which is located on the baseball diamond. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would feel like he is on the baseball diamond rather than in a desert, on a baseball field, in hell, or in a baseball stadium."}}
{"Q": "What negative effect can competing in a chess game on a cold day have?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) enemies (B) perform better (C) sweat (D) tension (E) frostbite", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Competing in a chess game on a cold day can cause tension, as the cold weather can make the muscles tense up and increase stress levels. This can negatively affect a player's performance and ability to think clearly. Sweat and frostbite are also possible negative effects, but they are less likely to be caused specifically by competing in a chess game on a cold day. Enemies and performing better are not relevant to the question."}}
{"Q": "Why is it hard for a young child to read a long book?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) knowledge (B) cover (C) no pictures (D) past (E) many words", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: Young children often rely on pictures to help them understand the story and keep their attention. A long book with no pictures can be overwhelming and difficult for them to stay engaged in."}}
{"Q": "On a hot day what can you do to enjoy something cool and sweet?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) dive (B) cool off (C) fresh cake (D) go for swim (E) eat ice cream", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Eating ice cream is a common and enjoyable way to cool off and satisfy a sweet tooth on a hot day.

{"Q": "What is likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) last word (B) conclusion (C) ikea instructions (D) afterword (E) epilogue", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Afterword.\nExplanation: An afterword is a section that comes after the main text of a book and provides additional information or commentary on the content. It is different from a foreword, which is typically written by someone other than the author and appears at the beginning of the book. A conclusion and epilogue are both parts of the main text and would not be found outside of it. IKEA instructions are not typically found in books, and the idea of a \"last word\" is not a specific section or feature of a book."}}
{"Q": "How many hours are in a day?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) week (B) bright (C) night (D) twenty four (E) year", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. twenty four.\nExplanation: There are 24 hours in a day, which is a well-known fact. The other options, such as week, bright, night, and year, are not relevant to the question and do not provide a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Why is religion so hard to understand?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) both positive and negative (B) unknowable (C) important to people (D) ocean (E) confusing", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. both positive and negative\nExplanation: Religion can be hard to understand because it encompasses both positive and negative aspects. On one hand, it can provide comfort, guidance, and a sense of community to believers. On the other hand, it can also be a source of conflict, intolerance, and oppression. Additionally, religious beliefs and practices can vary greatly between different cultures and individuals, making it difficult to generalize or fully comprehend."}}
{"Q": "The couple explained they were having trouble communicating, it seemed every conversation took great what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) thinking (B) effort (C) laugh (D) force (E) medium", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. effort.\nExplanation: The word \"trouble\" implies that the couple is struggling with something, and the fact that \"every conversation took great\" suggests that it requires a lot of work or exertion. Therefore, the most plausible answer is \"effort.\""}}
{"Q": "What would a person need to do if his or her captain dies at sea?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) cross street (B) have a party (C) experience life (D) cross road (E) man crew", "R": {"text": "Answer: Man crew.\nExplanation: If a captain dies at sea, someone needs to take charge of the ship and navigate it to safety. The crew would need to work together to ensure the safety of the ship and its passengers. Therefore, the most plausible answer is to man the crew. The other options are not relevant or appropriate in this situation."}}
{"Q": "What do children require to grow up healthy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) need care (B) come home (C) fast food (D) watch television (E) wash dishes", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. need care.\nExplanation: Children require care from their parents or caregivers to grow up healthy. This includes providing them with nutritious food, ensuring they get enough sleep and exercise, taking them to regular check-ups with a doctor, and providing a safe and nurturing environment. Fast food and excessive television watching can have negative effects on a child's health, while washing dishes is not a requirement for their growth and development."}}
{"Q": "I house outside the center of a community is said to be where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) city (B) subdivision (C) newspaper (D) residential area (E) street", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. residential area.\nExplanation: A house outside the center of a community is most likely located in a residential area, which is a neighborhood or district where people live. The other options, such as city, subdivision, newspaper, and street, do not accurately describe the location of a house outside the center of a community."}}
{"Q": "The field general began to write out a letter to the king, he was told to send what when the enemy was near?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) syllable (B) english alphabet (C) word (D) email (E) invitation", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. word\nExplanation: When the enemy is near, time is of the essence and the field general would need to quickly send a message to the king. Sending a syllable or the English alphabet would not convey any meaningful information, while an email or invitation would not be practical in a wartime situation. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the field general was told to send a word to the king."}}
{"Q": "What will you put on a pen to prevent it from drying out?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) write sentences on paper (B) ink in (C) ink cartridges (D) caps (E) cling film", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. caps\nExplanation: Caps are the most common and effective way to prevent a pen from drying out. When the cap is placed on the pen, it creates an airtight seal that prevents the ink from drying out. Writing on paper or using ink cartridges may help maintain the ink flow, but they do not prevent the pen from drying out completely. Cling film may also work, but it is not a practical solution as it can be difficult to wrap the pen tightly enough to create an airtight seal. Therefore, the best option is to always replace the cap on the pen when it is not in use."}}
{"Q": "After climbing the mountains, the explored found the cave, what was the general goegraphy of the region he found it in?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) west virginia (B) kentucky (C) desert (D) sea (E) rocky hills", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. rocky hills\nExplanation: The fact that the explorer climbed mountains suggests that the region is mountainous and therefore rocky. It is more likely that the cave would be found in rocky hills rather than a desert, sea, or states like West Virginia or Kentucky which are not necessarily known for their mountainous terrain."}}
{"Q": "They dealt with combustible mixtures in their experiments, this is why they kept a fire extinguisher where?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) hospital (B) chemistry lab (C) most businesses (D) classroom (E) public building", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (B) chemistry lab because combustible mixtures are commonly used in chemical experiments. It is standard practice to keep a fire extinguisher in a chemistry lab as a safety precaution. Hospitals, classrooms, and public buildings may also have fire extinguishers, but they are not as likely to deal with combustible mixtures as a chemistry lab. Most businesses may have fire extinguishers, but it would depend on the type of business and the potential fire hazards involved."}}
{"Q": "If someone mean wanted to insult somebody by calling them a fruit, where is probably not the smartest place to do it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) gay bar (B) market (C) grocery store (D) refrigerator (E) container", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Calling someone a fruit is often used as a derogatory term for someone who is gay. Therefore, it would not be wise to use this insult in a gay bar where it could potentially lead to a physical altercation or other negative consequences. The other options (market, grocery store, refrigerator, container) do not have the same potential for offense or danger."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get a toothpick if you do not have any?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) box (B) grocery store (C) eyes (D) chewing (E) mouth", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. box\nExplanation: Toothpicks are commonly found in boxes, either in restaurants or in households. It is unlikely that one would find a toothpick in a grocery store, as they are not typically sold individually. Using one's eyes or chewing on something else would not be effective in obtaining a toothpick. While it is possible to use one's mouth to remove food particles, it is not a reliable method for obtaining a toothpick. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A. box."}}
{"Q": "What would you be building if you designed a place for an annoying critter to stay?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) spread disease (B) swamp (C) fly away (D) cat condo (E) bug campers", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Cat condo.\nExplanation: A cat condo would be a suitable place for an annoying critter to stay as it would keep them contained and away from causing any harm or spreading disease. Additionally, cats are natural predators and could potentially help control the critter population."}}
{"Q": "The man working in the attic swatted away a bee, but soon the single bee was an entire what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) swarm (B) pack (C) countryside (D) soft drink (E) field of flowers", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. swarm.\nExplanation: When a single bee is swatted, it releases a pheromone that signals danger to other bees in the vicinity. This can cause them to swarm and attack the perceived threat. Therefore, it is more plausible that the single bee turned into a swarm rather than a pack, countryside, soft drink, or field of flowers."}}
{"Q": "What do you need to wear when hiking?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) cast iron stomach (B) physical exertion (C) shin splints (D) adventure (E) fatigue", "R": {"text": "Answer: Physical exertion.\nExplanation: When hiking, it is important to wear appropriate clothing and footwear that will allow for physical exertion. This includes comfortable and breathable clothing, sturdy hiking boots, and possibly a hat and sunglasses for sun protection. A cast iron stomach, shin splints, adventure, and fatigue are not items that can be worn or carried while hiking."}}
{"Q": "What type of store would have lots of sports equipment?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) mall (B) office supply store (C) school (D) sporting goods store (E) sporting event", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. sporting goods store\nExplanation: A sporting goods store specializes in selling sports equipment and gear, making it the most plausible option for a store with a lot of sports equipment.

Jewelry stores are known for selling high-end watches, making it a more plausible option than the other choices. A case or jewelry box would be used to store the watch, not purchase it. Shopping is too vague and could refer to any type of store. Hock refers to a pawn shop, which is unlikely to sell expensive luxury items."}}

The first step is that it will show you how to declare what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) tax return (B) bankruptcy (C) pleasure (D) debt (E) spending money", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. tax return\nExplanation: The new buying products are designed to help people who have no money, so it is likely that the first step would be to show them how to declare their tax return. This would help them to identify any potential refunds or credits they may be eligible for, which could provide them with some much-needed cash. Bankruptcy, pleasure, and spending money are not relevant to this context, while debt may be addressed later in the process."}}
{"Q": "Where can you buy a replacement ax handle?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) bathroom (B) hardware store (C) water fountain (D) grocery store (E) fridge", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is \"ridiculous,\" which means deserving or inviting mockery or derision. The other answer choices do not accurately reflect the meaning of the question."}}
{"Q": "Which group of states is Louisiana part of?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) deep south (B) 98 of world's crayfish (C) united states (D) gulf states (E) bible belt", "R": {"text": "Answer: D.

Putting it in the kitchen cupboard would be putting away a dirty dish, putting it on the floor or flea market would be inappropriate, and leaving it on the table would be messy and unsanitary."}}
{"Q": "James couldn't get comfortable.  There was too much dirt.  He needed to clean out what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) ground (B) subway (C) bank (D) bed (E) street", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: James couldn't get comfortable, which implies that he was trying to sleep or rest. The options (A), (B), (C), and (E) are all public places where it would be unlikely for James to be trying to sleep or rest. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (D) bed, as it is a place where one would typically try to get comfortable and rest. The mention of dirt also supports this answer, as it is common to clean out dirt or debris from a bed to make it more comfortable."}}
{"Q": "The rats were hiding in the house, where were they?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) sewers (B) laboratory (C) basement (D) clinic (E) cellar", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. basement\nExplanation: Rats are known to seek shelter in dark and secluded places, and a basement in a house would provide just that. Sewers and laboratories are not typically found in a house, and clinics and cellars may not be large enough to accommodate a significant number of rats. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the rats were hiding in the basement of the house."}}
{"Q": "What do people do when they don't understand something?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) ask questions (B) experience joy (C) believe in god (D) talk to each other (E) get sick", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. ask questions.\nExplanation: When people don't understand something, the most common and effective way to clarify their doubts is by asking questions.

Where did the string begin?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) end of line (B) hobby shop (C) his hand (D) toy store (E) child's hand", "R": {"text": "Answer: (E) child's hand\nExplanation: Since James saw a kite flying in the sky and traced the string back to its origin, it is more plausible that the string began in the hand of a child who was flying the kite. The other options, such as the end of a line or a hobby shop, do not make as much sense in the context of the scenario."}}

{"Q": "Where do people get beer after a bit of gambling?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bottle (B) grocery store (C) casino (D) spaceship (E) hockey game", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. casino\nExplanation: It is common for casinos to have bars or restaurants where patrons can purchase alcoholic beverages, including beer, after gambling. It is unlikely that people would go to a grocery store or hockey game specifically to get beer after gambling, and getting beer from a spaceship is not a realistic option. While it is possible to purchase beer in a bottle, the question does not specify where the bottle would be obtained from. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that people would get beer from a casino."}}

San Francisco.\nExplanation: San Francisco is a major city in the United States and has a well-established baseball team, the San Francisco Giants. It is also known for its modern architecture and innovative design, making it a likely location for a new baseball stadium. Phoenix and Chicago are also cities with baseball teams and could potentially have new stadiums, but San Francisco is the most plausible option out of the given choices. Antarctica and urban areas are not realistic options for a new baseball stadium."}}

Hotels, condominiums, and office buildings may also have ground floor entrances, but they are less likely to have a stoop. \"Entering building\" is too vague to be a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "If the wood texture is not smooth it is what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) gilded (B) porous (C) solid (D) painted (E) less dense than water", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. porous\nExplanation: If the wood texture is not smooth, it means that it has small holes or spaces on its surface, which makes it porous. Gilded means covered with a thin layer of gold, solid means having no holes or spaces, painted means covered with paint, and less dense than water means it will float on water. Therefore, porous is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What might happen if someone is not losing weight?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) loose skin (B) beauty (C) miss universe (D) death (E) healthier", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. healthier\nExplanation: Not losing weight may not necessarily lead to loose skin, beauty, or winning Miss Universe, but it could have negative health consequences if the person is overweight or obese.

Therefore, not losing weight could lead to a less healthy lifestyle and potentially shorten one's lifespan."}}
{"Q": "Billy lived in the capital of his country, then he moved.  Where might he move to?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) small town (B) jail (C) lower case (D) contain governmental activities (E) lowercase", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. small town\nExplanation: If Billy lived in the capital of his country, he may have moved to a smaller town for a change of pace or to be closer to nature. Moving to jail or a place that contains governmental activities seems unlikely without further context. \"Lower case\" is not a plausible answer as it does not refer to a location."}}

{"Q": "When getting in shape, this is something that does wonders?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) eat more (B) starve (C) give up (D) period of recovery (E) jogging", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. jogging\nExplanation: Jogging is a form of cardiovascular exercise that can help improve overall fitness and aid in weight loss. It can also improve mental health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.

While a period of recovery is important for muscle growth and repair, it is not the primary factor in getting in shape."}}
{"Q": "What could prevent a driving car from continuing to drive?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) automobile accidents (B) backache (C) pollution (D) smoke (E) low fuel tank", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.

They may feel free from the constant negativity and emotional abuse that they may have experienced during the marriage. While they may also experience grief or anger, relief is a common feeling after leaving a toxic relationship. Isolation may also occur, but it is not necessarily a direct result of the end of the marriage. Happiness may come later, but it is not an immediate reaction."}}
{"Q": "Despite the large crowds, how did the depressed man feel?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) small group (B) alone (C) solitary (D) solitude (E) panic", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. alone\nExplanation: The word \"despite\" indicates that the large crowds did not have a positive effect on the man's mood. Therefore, options A, C, and D, which suggest being alone or in solitude, are more likely to be the correct answer. Option E, panic, does not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, option B, alone, is the most plausible answer as it suggests that the man felt isolated despite being surrounded by a large crowd."}}
{"Q": "Where does a maid empty a trash can?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) bus stop (B) corner (C) hockey game (D) motel (E) alley", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. motel\nExplanation: A maid is typically employed at a motel or hotel to clean and maintain guest rooms. It is common for them to empty trash cans in the guest rooms and dispose of the waste in a designated area, such as a dumpster or trash compactor on the motel's property.

The most likely reason for a dog to be tired is from physical activity, such as going for a walk. Therefore, option A, walked, is the most plausible answer.

{"Q": "He used an umbrella while tanning, where was he likely?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) waves (B) seattle (C) suitcase (D) beach (E) jacket closet", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. beach\nExplanation: It is common for people to use an umbrella while tanning on the beach to protect themselves from the sun.

This involves doing exercises such as scales, lip trills, and breathing exercises to prepare their voice for the performance. Using microphones and clearing throats may be necessary during the show, but warming up is essential beforehand. Creating music and sounding beautiful are ongoing processes that require practice and skill development, but warming up is a specific pre-show activity."}}

The goal of treatment is to effectively manage symptoms and improve the person's quality of life. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer. Options A, B, and E are incorrect because they suggest negative outcomes of treatment, which is not the case. Option D is partially correct, but it does not fully capture the idea of effective treatment."}}
{"Q": "What type of feeling is performing for the first time likely to produce?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) action (B) butterflies (C) happiness (D) a sense of calm (E) anxiety", "R": {"text": "Answer: (E) anxiety\nExplanation: Performing for the first time can be nerve-wracking and anxiety-inducing. It is natural to feel nervous and unsure of oneself when stepping onto a stage or in front of an audience for the first time. This feeling is commonly referred to as \"butterflies\" in the stomach. While some performers may feel a sense of excitement or action, it is more likely that they will experience anxiety before their first performance."}}
{"Q": "If someone is found to be committing murder, what did they do to someone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) misery (B) kill (C) distress (D) tickel (E) go to jail", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. kill.\nExplanation: If someone is found to be committing murder, it means they have taken someone's life intentionally, which is the definition of killing.

It also has no atmosphere to protect from solar radiation and has a weak magnetic field. Additionally, the planet's surface is covered in craters, cliffs, and rocky terrain, making it difficult for humans to live and work there. Therefore, it is considered uninhabitable."}}

{"Q": "A creek could be located in the opposite for the city which is called what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) meadow (B) stick (C) valley (D) forest (E) countryside", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: A creek is a small stream of water that is usually found in rural or natural areas. The term \"countryside\" refers to the rural areas outside of cities and towns, which would be a more likely location for a creek than the other options. A meadow is a grassy field, a stick is an object made of wood, a valley is a low area between hills or mountains, and a forest is a dense area of trees. While a creek could potentially be found in any of these locations, the most likely option is the countryside."}}

Tide pool.\nExplanation: Anemones are marine animals that are commonly found in tide pools along the eastern coast of the United States. They attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces and use their tentacles to capture prey. While anemones can also be found in aquariums, it is more likely to encounter them in their natural habitat of a tide pool. They would not be found in a flower bed or the Coral Sea, and while there are some species of anemones in the Florida Keys, they are not as common as in tide pools."}}
{"Q": "Where are traveling clothes often kept?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) suitcase (B) bedroom (C) closet (D) draws (E) dresser", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. suitcase\nExplanation: Traveling clothes are often kept in a suitcase because they are specifically packed for a trip. Suitcases are designed to hold clothing and other items needed for travel, making them the most plausible option for where traveling clothes are kept.

Go to movies.\nExplanation: To see new films, the most plausible option is to go to the movies. This is because new films are typically released in theaters before they are available for home viewing. While it is true that you need to open your eyes to see the movie, it is not a sufficient answer as you can open your eyes and not be in a position to see a new film. Kicking a ball and making art are not related to seeing new films, so they are not plausible answers. Looking for new films may involve searching online or asking friends for recommendations, but ultimately you still need to go to the movies to see them."}}
{"Q": "What can happen when you contemplate alone for a long time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) daydream (B) headache (C) get ideas (D) sleep (E) become distracted", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. get ideas.\nExplanation: When you contemplate alone for a long time, you are giving your mind the opportunity to wander and explore different thoughts and ideas. This can lead to new insights and perspectives, and ultimately result in generating new ideas. While daydreaming and becoming distracted are also possible outcomes, getting a headache or falling asleep are less likely as they are not directly related to the act of contemplation."}}
{"Q": "The pioneer went to the general store for storage measures, what was he looking for?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) checkers (B) barrels (C) baking soda (D) buffalo (E) salt", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. barrels\nExplanation: The pioneer went to the general store for storage measures, which suggests that he needed something to store goods in. Checkers, baking soda, and buffalo are not storage measures, while salt could be stored in barrels but it is more commonly stored in bags. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B. barrels."}}
{"Q": "I was apprehensive to buy the expensive equipment to play a game with so much walking and swinging around in grass, but now I understand why people what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) care less (B) play golf (C) shake hands (D) believe in god (E) trip over", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. care less.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the speaker was hesitant to buy expensive equipment for a game that involves a lot of physical activity. However, the speaker now understands why people enjoy the game so much. Therefore, it is likely that the speaker has become less concerned about the cost of the equipment and more interested in playing the game. Choice A, \"care less,\" is the most plausible answer as it aligns with the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "What can a newspaper be used to do to an engagement?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) announce (B) communicate (C) educate (D) inform (E) cancel", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. communicate\nExplanation: A newspaper can be used to communicate information about an engagement, such as the date, time, and location of an event. It can also provide details about the couple, their families, and any other relevant information. While a newspaper can also inform and educate readers, the primary purpose in this context would be to communicate the details of the engagement. Announcing or canceling an engagement would typically be done through other means, such as social media or personal communication."}}
{"Q": "John needed a straight wire.  Unfortunately, this one had endured some abuse and had become what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bent (B) bent (C) crooked (D) straightforth (E) curved", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The sentence states that John needed a straight wire, but unfortunately, the wire had endured some abuse. This implies that the wire is no longer straight, so options A, B, and D can be eliminated. The word \"crooked\" means not straight, so option C is the most plausible answer. Option E, \"curved,\" is not necessarily the same as being crooked or not straight."}}
{"Q": "Metal is taken from what which is pulled from the ground?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) dirt (B) instruments (C) ore (D) car (E) junkyard", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: Metal is typically extracted from ore, which is a naturally occurring mineral or rock that contains a high enough concentration of metal to be economically viable to extract. Dirt, instruments, cars, and junkyards may contain metal, but they are not the primary source of metal."}}
{"Q": "When not in use where on your property would you store you bucket?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) utility closet (B) outside (C) well (D) garden shed (E) garage", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) garden shed\nExplanation: Storing a bucket outside or in a well may expose it to the elements and cause it to deteriorate faster. Storing it in a utility closet or garage may take up valuable space needed for other items. A garden shed provides a secure and dry location for storing a bucket when not in use, while also keeping it easily accessible for future use."}}
{"Q": "What does someone do to relax at night?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) find time (B) check mail (C) listen to music (D) go to bed (E) stop worrying", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. listen to music.\nExplanation: Listening to music is a common way for people to relax at night. It can help to calm the mind and reduce stress, making it easier to fall asleep. Checking mail or worrying can actually have the opposite effect and keep someone awake, while going to bed is the ultimate goal but not necessarily a way to relax. Finding time is also important, but it is not a specific activity that promotes relaxation."}}
{"Q": "Where might the stapler be if I cannot find it?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) office building (B) office supply store (C) desk drawer (D) with dwight (E) desktop", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. desk drawer\nExplanation: The most likely place for a stapler to be is in a desk drawer, as it is a common storage location for office supplies. While it is possible that the stapler could be in an office building or an office supply store, these options are less likely as they are not specific locations where an individual would typically keep their personal stapler. The option of \"with Dwight\" is a reference to a character from the TV show The Office and is not a realistic possibility. The option of \"desktop\" is also a possibility, but less likely than the desk drawer as it is a more visible location and the stapler would be more easily found."}}
{"Q": "Many homes in this country are built around a courtyard. Where is it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) candidate (B) spain (C) lawn (D) asshole (E) office complex", "R": {"text": "Answer: Spain.\nExplanation: Spain is known for its traditional architecture that often includes homes built around a central courtyard, known as a \"patio\" in Spanish. This design is common in many regions of Spain, particularly in Andalusia, where the hot climate makes it ideal for outdoor living spaces. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer among the given choices."}}
{"Q": "Sean was a wreck.  He  loved to build houses, but in his current state, he couldn't do what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) stand up (B) produce (C) construct (D) make (E) build", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. construct\nExplanation: The sentence states that Sean loved to build houses, but he was a wreck. This implies that he was not in a good mental or physical state to construct houses. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) construct."}}
{"Q": "What would be happening if you are pretending to be a police officer?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) fighting (B) misunderstanding (C) deception (D) play (E) distrust", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. deception\nExplanation: Pretending to be a police officer involves deceiving others into believing that you have the authority and power of a law enforcement officer. This is a form of deception and can have serious legal consequences."}}
{"Q": "Where would you buy a finely crafted writing instrument?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) nasa (B) classroom (C) stationery store (D) purse (E) office supply store", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. stationery store\nExplanation: A stationery store is a more plausible answer as it specializes in selling writing instruments and other office supplies. They are likely to have a variety of options for finely crafted writing instruments, such as fountain pens or high-end ballpoint pens. NASA, classroom, purse, and office supply stores are not likely to have a significant selection of finely crafted writing instruments."}}
{"Q": "The detective was finding information from witnesses, why would he do that?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) fun (B) ulcers (C) get answers (D) happiness (E) power", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. get answers.\nExplanation: The detective's job is to solve a crime or mystery, and gathering information from witnesses is a crucial part of that process. By talking to witnesses, the detective can gather important details and clues that can help them piece together what happened and identify potential suspects. It is not likely that the detective is doing this for fun, happiness, or power, and it is certainly not a pleasant task that would bring ulcers."}}
{"Q": "Joe found spiders in the place where he keeps his tools.  Where might that be?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) cupboard (B) toolbox (C) closet (D) garage (E) mail box", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. toolbox\nExplanation: Spiders are often found in dark and secluded places, and a toolbox is a common place to store tools. Cupboards and closets may also be possible locations, but a garage or mailbox would be less likely places to find spiders in relation to tools."}}
{"Q": "While on the fan boat he thought he'd see swamps and gators, but he was surprised to spot a bald eagle in what nature area?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) everglades (B) high places (C) natural habitat (D) new york (E) colorado", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. everglades\nExplanation: The Everglades is a well-known nature area in Florida that is home to many species of wildlife, including alligators and bald eagles. It is a popular destination for fan boat tours, so it is plausible that the person on the fan boat would spot a bald eagle in this area. The other choices, such as \"high places\" and \"New York,\" do not make as much sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "Where are you likely to find a supermarket?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) buy food for family (B) city or town (C) get supplies (D) strip mall (E) vermont", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. city or town.\nExplanation: Supermarkets are typically located in urban or suburban areas where there is a high population density and demand for groceries. While supermarkets can be found in strip malls, they are also commonly standalone buildings or part of larger shopping centers. The purpose of a supermarket is to provide a convenient location for people to buy food and household supplies, so it is unlikely to be found in a rural area like Vermont where there may not be enough demand to support a large grocery store."}}
{"Q": "Where would you need to use a lantern?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) grocery store (B) antique shop (C) house (D) dark place (E) street", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. dark place\nExplanation: A lantern is typically used in a dark place where there is no or limited source of light. It can be used during camping, power outages, or in areas with poor lighting. It is not commonly used in a grocery store, antique shop, house, or on a well-lit street."}}
{"Q": "What area does a police officer patrol?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) direct traffic (B) city (C) beat (D) street (E) park", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. beat\nExplanation: A police officer typically patrols a designated area known as their beat. This can be a specific neighborhood or section of a city that they are responsible for monitoring and responding to any incidents or emergencies that may occur. While they may direct traffic or patrol streets and parks within their beat, the beat itself encompasses a larger area than just one street or park. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Why would a woman kill a stranger she met in a dark alley?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) being raped (B) get rid of (C) they didn't know the passcode (D) get revenge (E) were evil", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. being raped\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a woman would kill a stranger she met in a dark alley if she was being raped or felt threatened with sexual assault. This is a common scenario where women may resort to self-defense to protect themselves from harm. The other options such as getting rid of, not knowing the passcode, getting revenge, or being evil do not provide a clear motive for killing a stranger in a dark alley."}}
{"Q": "The baby was cranky, it needed to eat breakfast but refused to what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) buy food (B) open mouth (C) get out of bed (D) cry (E) wake up", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence states that the baby needed to eat breakfast, but refused to do something. The only option that makes sense in this context is \"open mouth,\" as that is the action required to eat breakfast. The other options do not fit the context or are not actions that would solve the problem of the baby being cranky and needing to eat."}}
{"Q": "What is made up of people?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) buildings (B) audience (C) apartment (D) classroom (E) falling down", "R": {"text": "Answer: Audience.\nExplanation: An audience is made up of people who are gathered to watch or listen to a performance or presentation. Buildings, apartments, and classrooms are physical structures that can contain people, but they are not made up of people themselves. \"Falling down\" is not a valid answer as it does not make sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "He was afraid he would die from his cold, so he wisely decided to what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) ocean (B) write will (C) never want (D) were shot (E) seek help", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The most logical choice is to seek help, as a cold is typically not life-threatening and can be treated with medication and rest. Seeking medical attention would be the wise decision to ensure that the cold does not develop into a more serious illness. The other options, such as going to the ocean or writing a will, do not address the immediate concern of the cold and are not relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get a pen if you do not have one?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) briefcase (B) desk drawer (C) friend's house (D) pocket (E) sidewalk", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. pocket\nExplanation: It is more likely that someone would have a pen in their pocket than finding one on the sidewalk or in a friend's house. A briefcase or desk drawer may also be possible options, but it depends on the individual's occupation or location."}}
{"Q": "Why would a small dog pant if it's hot outside?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) outside (B) europe (C) heat (D) wet (E) dog show", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: Small dogs, like all dogs, pant to regulate their body temperature. When it's hot outside, they pant more to release heat and cool down. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (C) heat. The other options, such as (A) outside, (B) Europe, (D) wet, and (E) dog show, do not directly relate to why a small dog would pant in hot weather."}}
{"Q": "She asked her little boy why, he replied that he didn't know and it was just what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) case (B) reason (C) how (D) because (E) answer", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The little boy's response of \"he didn't know\" suggests that he was asked for a reason or explanation for something. Therefore, the most plausible answer is \"because,\" which would complete the sentence as \"he didn't know because it was just...\""}}
{"Q": "Where would you display a picture on a horizontal surface?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) microwave (B) desktop (C) shelf (D) art show (E) wall", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. shelf\nExplanation: A picture would be most commonly displayed on a shelf, as it is a flat horizontal surface that is often used for decorative purposes. A microwave is not a suitable surface for displaying pictures, as it is meant for cooking food. A desktop could be used for displaying pictures, but it is not as common as a shelf. An art show is a temporary exhibition space for artwork, and a wall is a vertical surface."}}
{"Q": "What skill is needed for riding a bike?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) wheels (B) feet (C) pedalling (D) practice (E) good balance", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. good balance\nExplanation: Riding a bike requires good balance in order to stay upright and avoid falling off. While wheels and pedalling are necessary components of a bike, they alone do not ensure successful riding. Feet are used to push off and maintain balance, but good balance is the key skill needed for riding a bike. Practice can certainly improve one's balance and overall bike riding ability, but it is not the sole skill needed."}}
{"Q": "He looked at the field of pumps, all slowing churning oil out of the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) manual (B) street (C) restaurant (D) ground (E) service station", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. ground.\nExplanation: The context suggests that the pumps are churning oil out of the ground, which is a common location for oil extraction. The other options (manual, street, restaurant, service station) do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The department to where vendors deliver goods for sale is called what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) delivered (B) take away (C) receiving (D) pick up (E) keep", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The department to where vendors deliver goods for sale is called the receiving department. This is where the goods are received and checked for quality and quantity before being distributed to other departments or put up for sale. Option A, delivered, is incorrect as it refers to the action of delivering goods rather than the department. Option B, take away, is also incorrect as it implies that the vendors take away the goods instead of delivering them. Option D, pick up, is also incorrect as it implies that the department is where vendors come to pick up goods instead of delivering them. Option E, keep, is also incorrect as it does not relate to the department where goods are received."}}
{"Q": "Where is the worst place to be in a ticket office?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) at the top (B) movie theaters (C) train station (D) end of line (E) opera house", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) end of line\nExplanation: Being at the end of the line in a ticket office means that you have to wait the longest to be served. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially if there are a lot of people in front of you. Additionally, if the ticket office is busy, there may be a higher chance of tickets selling out before you reach the front of the line."}}
{"Q": "Exercise is very good for you, for faster recovery you should always do what afterwards?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) stretch (B) lower cholesterol (C) weigh (D) track (E) expend energy", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Stretching after exercise helps to increase blood flow to the muscles, reduce muscle soreness, and improve flexibility. This can lead to faster recovery and better overall performance in future workouts. Lowering cholesterol, weighing, tracking, and expending energy are all important for overall health, but they are not specifically related to post-exercise recovery."}}
{"Q": "What happens when you go somewhere and forget something at home?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) arriving (B) arrive there (C) turn around (D) go back (E) fart", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. go back.\nExplanation: If you forget something at home, the most logical thing to do is to go back and retrieve it. Turning around or farting are not viable options, and arriving or arrive there do not address the issue of the forgotten item."}}
{"Q": "Where would you acquire a wind instrument for you own use?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) band practice (B) concert (C) music store (D) symphony (E) music room", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. music store\nExplanation: A music store is the most likely place to acquire a wind instrument for personal use. They specialize in selling musical instruments and have a wide variety of options to choose from. Band practice, concerts, symphonies, and music rooms are all places where wind instruments may be played, but they are not typically where one would go to purchase an instrument for personal use."}}
{"Q": "Where would a person light alcohol on fire to observe the reaction?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) supermarket (B) bar (C) pub (D) restaurants (E) chemistry lab", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Lighting alcohol on fire is a common experiment in chemistry labs to observe the reaction and properties of the substance. It is not safe or appropriate to do so in public places like supermarkets, bars, pubs, or restaurants. Therefore, the most plausible answer is E, chemistry lab."}}
{"Q": "If a storey contained a panoramic view, what kind of structure would it be in?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) horizontal room (B) storey book (C) mall (D) tall building (E) book of stories", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tall building.\nExplanation: A panoramic view is typically associated with a high vantage point, which would be found in a tall building. A horizontal room or mall may have windows, but they would not necessarily provide a panoramic view. A storey book or book of stories are not physical structures and would not contain a panoramic view."}}
{"Q": "Where does lettuce arrive by large trucks?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) kitchen (B) supermarket (C) farmer's market (D) salad (E) refrigerator", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. supermarket.\nExplanation: Lettuce is typically transported by large trucks to supermarkets where it is sold to consumers. While lettuce may also be sold at farmer's markets, it is less likely to be transported in large quantities by trucks to these smaller venues. The kitchen and refrigerator are not locations where lettuce is typically transported to, and \"salad\" is not a location at all."}}
{"Q": "Why do people who are dying receive social security payments?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) rejuvenation (B) born again (C) no longer exist (D) unable to work (E) change of color", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Unable to work.\nExplanation: Social security payments are intended to provide financial support to individuals who are no longer able to work due to age, disability, or other reasons. People who are dying may be unable to work due to their medical condition, and therefore may be eligible for social security payments."}}
{"Q": "What should I do with a jumping rope?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) fatigue (B) sweating (C) get tired (D) tiredness (E) hopping", "R": {"text": "Answer: Hopping.\nExplanation: Jumping rope involves hopping over a rope that is swung over the head and under the feet. Therefore, the most plausible answer is hopping. The other choices are related to the physical effects of exercise, but do not accurately describe what one should do with a jumping rope."}}
{"Q": "What do geese do every fall in fields?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) guard house (B) fly (C) eat (D) follow ultralight airplane (E) group together", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: Geese are known to migrate during the fall season, and one of their main activities during this time is to eat and fatten up for their long journey. They often stop in fields to feed on leftover crops and grasses. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that they eat in fields during the fall."}}
{"Q": "I took my seat, the curtains drew back and I enjoyed the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) airplane (B) movie (C) auditorium (D) theatre (E) show", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. theatre.\nExplanation: The context suggests that the person is sitting in a place where curtains are drawn back, which is a common feature in a theatre. Additionally, the word \"seat\" also implies that the person is in a theatre. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (D) theatre."}}
{"Q": "What should everyone do who doesn't want to fight anymore?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) explicate (B) pay tribute to king (C) hope for peace (D) wear shoes (E) do well", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. hope for peace.\nExplanation: If someone doesn't want to fight anymore, the most plausible option would be to hope for peace. This means that they are willing to find a peaceful solution to the conflict rather than resorting to violence. Explicating or explaining their position may not necessarily lead to peace, paying tribute to a king may not be relevant in all situations, and wearing shoes or doing well are not directly related to resolving conflicts. Therefore, hoping for peace is the most appropriate and practical option."}}
{"Q": "Where is the ideal location for a post office?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) building (B) business district (C) above ground (D) most towns (E) center of town", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. center of town\nExplanation: The center of town is the most convenient location for a post office as it is easily accessible to all residents and businesses in the area. It is also a central location for mail carriers to distribute mail to surrounding neighborhoods. Additionally, having a post office in the center of town can attract foot traffic and potentially boost local businesses."}}
{"Q": "Where outside of a city would a squirrel live?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) roof (B) inside home (C) forest (D) yard (E) park", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. forest\nExplanation: Squirrels are wild animals and typically live in natural habitats such as forests, woodlands, and parks with trees. They build their nests, called dreys, in the branches of trees and use the surrounding environment to find food and shelter. While squirrels may occasionally venture into yards or parks near cities, it is unlikely that they would live on a roof or inside a home."}}
{"Q": "You should watch out for snakes if floating down what African body of water?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) wet grass (B) western texas (C) high grass (D) amazon river (E) tree", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. high grass\nExplanation: Snakes are known to inhabit areas with high grass, as it provides cover and shelter for them. Therefore, if you are floating down a body of water in Africa and there is high grass along the banks, you should watch out for snakes. The other options, such as wet grass, western Texas, the Amazon River, and trees, are not specific enough to suggest a higher likelihood of encountering snakes."}}
{"Q": "At the end of the day as he began to eat he paused and thanked her, it wasn't often she would what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cook dinner (B) did chores (C) make food (D) stretch out (E) get food", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the person paused to thank her before beginning to eat, implying that she had done something for him. The options (A) cook dinner and (B) did chores are too broad and could refer to any number of tasks, while (D) stretch out and (E) get food don't make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, (C) make food is the most plausible answer as it specifically refers to the act of preparing a meal, which is something that the person would likely be grateful for."}}
{"Q": "To what do trees roots cling?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) yard (B) orchard (C) museum (D) countryside (E) surface of earth", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. surface of earth\nExplanation: Tree roots cling to the surface of the earth in order to anchor the tree and absorb nutrients and water from the soil. The other choices, such as yard, orchard, museum, and countryside, do not accurately describe what tree roots cling to."}}
{"Q": "What probably has a lot of dust in the back?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) closet (B) door (C) corner (D) shelf (E) library", "R": {"text": "Answer: Closet.\nExplanation: Closets are often used to store items that are not frequently used, such as seasonal clothing or old belongings. These items can accumulate dust over time, especially if the closet is not regularly cleaned. Therefore, it is more likely that a closet has a lot of dust in the back compared to a door, corner, shelf, or library."}}
{"Q": "At the new comic store he found himself making friends, it was nice to meet people with what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) smiling (B) smile (C) open mind (D) common interests (E) laughter", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (D) common interests because the sentence suggests that the protagonist found it nice to meet people at the comic store, which implies that they share a common interest in comics. The other options, such as (A) smiling, (B) smile, and (E) laughter, may be positive attributes of the people the protagonist met, but they do not necessarily indicate a shared interest in comics. (C) open mind is also a positive attribute, but it does not necessarily relate to the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "The student explained he had a clue what neuroepithelium was and got really nervous, he then lost his balance because a what issue?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) tastebud (B) retina (C) inner ear (D) nasal cavity (E) autistic", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. inner ear\nExplanation: The inner ear is responsible for balance and equilibrium. Losing balance can be a symptom of inner ear issues such as vertigo or Meniere's disease. The other options (tastebud, retina, nasal cavity, autistic) do not directly relate to balance or the inner ear."}}
{"Q": "What could people do that involves talking?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) confession (B) state park (C) sing (D) carnival (E) opera", "R": {"text": "Answer: Confession.\nExplanation: Confession involves talking to a religious leader or counselor about one's sins or problems. It is a common practice in many religions and can be a way for individuals to seek guidance and forgiveness."}}
{"Q": "If you're a child answering questions and an adult is asking them that adult is doing what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) discussion (B) explaning (C) teaching (D) confusion (E) correct", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: If an adult is asking a child questions, they are likely trying to teach or educate the child on a particular topic. The adult may be trying to gauge the child's understanding or encourage critical thinking. Therefore, the most plausible answer is teaching."}}
{"Q": "He has lactose intolerant, but was eating dinner made of cheese, what followed for him?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) digestive (B) feel better (C) sleepiness (D) indigestion (E) illness", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. indigestion\nExplanation: Since he is lactose intolerant, his body cannot properly digest lactose, which is found in dairy products like cheese. Eating dinner made of cheese would likely result in indigestion, as his body would struggle to break down the lactose. Symptoms of lactose intolerance can include bloating, gas, diarrhea, and stomach pain."}}
{"Q": "The teacher played on the upright piano, she was explaining the song to all the students in the what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) music room (B) bathroom (C) house (D) living room (E) music store", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. music room.\nExplanation: It is most likely that the teacher was explaining the song to the students in a music room, as this is a common location for music lessons and rehearsals. The other options, such as bathroom, house, living room, and music store, are less likely to be the location for a music lesson."}}
{"Q": "When you get an F, you fail. If you get A's you are?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) passed (B) completing (C) passed (D) passing (E) succeeding", "R": {"text": "Answer: Passing.\nExplanation: Getting an F means failing, so the opposite of that would be passing. A's are typically associated with good grades and academic success, so it makes sense to say that if you get A's, you are passing. The other options don't quite fit as well - \"passed\" implies that you've already completed something, \"completing\" suggests that you're in the process of finishing something, and \"succeeding\" is a bit too broad and doesn't necessarily relate specifically to grades or academic performance."}}
{"Q": "What is the main purpose of having a bath?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cleanness (B) wetness (C) exfoliation (D) use water (E) hygiene", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. cleanness\nExplanation: The main purpose of having a bath is to clean oneself and remove dirt, sweat, and bacteria from the body. Bathing also helps to refresh and relax the body and mind. While wetness and the use of water are necessary components of bathing, they are not the main purpose. Exfoliation and hygiene can be secondary benefits of bathing, but the primary goal is to achieve cleanness."}}
{"Q": "The ball was hit over a boundary and struck an audience member.  What kind of game were they playing?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sporting event (B) sporting (C) basketball (D) society (E) ranch country", "R": {"text": "Answer: A sporting event.\nExplanation: The fact that a ball was hit over a boundary suggests that it was a game with defined boundaries, which is common in many sports. Additionally, the mention of an audience member implies that it was a game that is typically watched by spectators, further supporting the idea that it was a sporting event."}}
{"Q": "What is someone operating a vehicle likely to be accused of after becoming inebriated?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) punish (B) arrest (C) automobile accidents (D) drunk driving (E) talking nonsense", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. drunk driving.\nExplanation: When someone becomes inebriated while operating a vehicle, they are likely to be accused of drunk driving. This is a serious offense that can result in legal consequences such as fines, license suspension, and even imprisonment. It is important to never drink and drive to ensure the safety of oneself and others on the road."}}
{"Q": "Where would you get jewelry if you do not have any?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) vault (B) suitcase (C) neighbour's house (D) department store (E) safe deposit box", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. department store.\nExplanation: Department stores are a common place to purchase jewelry. They have a wide variety of options and price ranges to choose from. The other options, such as a vault, suitcase, neighbor's house, or safe deposit box, are not typical places to obtain jewelry."}}
{"Q": "What is a philosopher waiting for to eventually gain through his studies?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) job (B) boredom (C) anxiety (D) impatience (E) wisdom", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. wisdom\nExplanation: Philosophers study to gain knowledge and understanding of the world and human existence. The ultimate goal of their studies is to gain wisdom, which is the ability to apply knowledge and understanding to make wise decisions and live a fulfilling life. A philosopher is not necessarily waiting for a job, boredom, anxiety, or impatience to gain anything from their studies."}}
{"Q": "What do young boys do on the ice in the winter?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) ski (B) play hockey (C) summer (D) knit (E) warm", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Young boys often play hockey on the ice in the winter. It is a popular winter sport in many countries, especially in Canada and the northern United States. Skiing is also a popular winter activity, but it is not as common among young boys as hockey. Summer and knitting are not related to winter ice activities. \"Warm\" is not an activity, but rather a state of being."}}
{"Q": "She loved spending money at the thrift store on knickknacks, this resulted in a lot of what on every shelf in her house?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) poverty (B) clutter (C) getting (D) satisfaction (E) more happiness", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. clutter.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the woman enjoys buying knickknacks from the thrift store, which implies that she has a lot of them. The phrase \"resulted in a lot of\" indicates that there is an excess of something, and the word \"knickknacks\" implies small decorative items that can easily accumulate and create clutter. Therefore, option B, clutter, is the most plausible answer. Options A, C, D, and E do not fit the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "I listened to lecture intensely, what is my goal?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) gain confidence (B) concentrate (C) get attention (D) pay attention (E) stop talking", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. pay attention.\nExplanation: The statement \"I listened to lecture intensely\" implies that the goal was to focus and concentrate on the lecture, which is the definition of paying attention. The other options, such as gaining confidence or getting attention, do not fit the context of the statement."}}
{"Q": "If a person is using a computer to talk to their granddaughter, what might the computer cause for them?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) program created (B) stress (C) happiness (D) ocean (E) headache", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. happiness\nExplanation: The computer is being used to talk to the person's granddaughter, which suggests that they are likely having a positive interaction. Therefore, it is more plausible that the computer is causing happiness rather than stress, an ocean, or a headache. While a program may be involved in facilitating the conversation, it is not the most likely outcome of using a computer to talk to a loved one."}}
{"Q": "Joe was there to meet a large number of people.  As he filed though the entrance hall, he saw many strangers who came from far away.  What sort of building is he probably in?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) person (B) box (C) convention center (D) public building (E) large building", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. convention center\nExplanation: The description of Joe meeting a large number of people who came from far away suggests that he is in a place where events or gatherings are held, such as a convention center. Choices A and B are not plausible as they do not describe a type of building, while choices D and E are too broad and do not provide enough specific information."}}
{"Q": "John wanted scatter his wife's remains in a lake in the wilderness.  He had to delay before of where he lived.  Where did he live?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) mountains (B) dead body (C) pay debts (D) state park (E) new york", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) mountains\nExplanation: The fact that John wanted to scatter his wife's remains in a lake in the wilderness suggests that he lived in a remote area, possibly in the mountains. The other choices (dead body, pay debts, state park, New York) do not seem to be relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Many towns and cities have trash cans where on sidewalks?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) hospital (B) park (C) corner (D) motel (E) office", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. park\nExplanation: It is common for towns and cities to have trash cans placed on sidewalks near parks, as people often generate waste while enjoying outdoor activities. Hospitals, motels, and offices may have their own designated waste disposal systems, while corners may not be the most convenient or accessible location for trash cans."}}
{"Q": "The family wanted to adopt for enviro-ethical reasons, what did they abhor?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) orphan (B) biological child (C) give away (D) foster child (E) abandon", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. abandon\nExplanation: The family's desire to adopt for enviro-ethical reasons suggests that they are concerned about the impact of overpopulation on the environment. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would want to contribute to the problem by having a biological child or giving away a child they already have. Similarly, fostering a child would not necessarily reduce the overall population. Adopting an orphan would be a positive action, but it is not necessarily related to environmental concerns. Abandonment, on the other hand, is a clear example of irresponsible behavior that can contribute to overpopulation and environmental degradation. Therefore, it is plausible that the family would abhor abandonment and seek to adopt a child who has been abandoned or is at risk of being abandoned."}}
{"Q": "What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) stall (B) start melting (C) taxi (D) crash (E) speed up", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: If airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight, the airplane will lose power and altitude, eventually leading to a crash. Without the engines, the airplane cannot maintain lift and will fall out of the sky."}}
{"Q": "Where would you be concerned about finding a cavity?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) solid object (B) molar (C) dentist (D) unbrushed tooth (E) teeth", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Molar\nExplanation: Molars are the teeth located at the back of the mouth that are used for grinding and chewing food. They have many grooves and crevices that can trap food particles and bacteria, making them more susceptible to developing cavities. It is important to maintain good oral hygiene and visit the dentist regularly to prevent and treat cavities in molars."}}
{"Q": "Human beings learn about current events from what print item?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) question authority (B) melt (C) read newspapers (D) act (E) dictionary", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: Reading newspapers is a common and widely accepted way for human beings to learn about current events. Newspapers provide up-to-date information on local, national, and international news, as well as opinions and analysis from journalists and experts. While questioning authority and taking action are important aspects of being an informed citizen, they are not necessarily the primary ways in which people learn about current events. Melt and dictionary are not relevant to the question."}}
{"Q": "In what kind of environment does an anemone live?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) nursery (B) south pacific (C) desert (D) sea water (E) atlantic ocean", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. sea water\nExplanation: Anemones are aquatic animals that live in the sea water. They are commonly found in coral reefs, rocky shores, and tide pools. They have a symbiotic relationship with clownfish, which live among their tentacles for protection. Therefore, the most plausible answer is sea water."}}
{"Q": "He wanted lodging in the actual what, so that he was already where he needed to be?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) a yurt (B) resort area (C) big city (D) michigan (E) going on vacation", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. big city\nExplanation: The phrase \"actual what\" is a bit unclear, but the context suggests that the person is looking for lodging in a specific location where they need to be. Option A, a yurt, is unlikely to be the desired location for most people. Option B, resort area, is too broad and doesn't provide a specific location. Option D, Michigan, is a state and not a specific location. Option E, going on vacation, is not a location at all. Therefore, option C, big city, is the most plausible answer as it provides a specific type of location where one might need to be for work or other purposes."}}
{"Q": "If I am suffering from boredom, and I want to see something beautiful, what should I do?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) see art (B) see ghost (C) watch film (D) grocery shop (E) do crossword puzzle", "R": {"text": "Answer: See art.\nExplanation: Seeing art can be a great way to alleviate boredom and appreciate beauty. Art can come in many forms, such as paintings, sculptures, or even street art. Visiting a museum or art gallery can provide a stimulating and visually pleasing experience. Additionally, many cities have public art installations that can be enjoyed for free."}}
{"Q": "The goal was to hit the target, but a projectile ball can't hit anything if it isn't in what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) motion (B) ocean (C) flintlock (D) arcade (E) tennis court", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. motion\nExplanation: In order for a projectile ball to hit a target, it must be in motion. Without motion, the ball will not be able to travel towards the target and make contact with it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Options B, C, D, and E are irrelevant to the scenario and do not contribute to the ball's ability to hit the target."}}
{"Q": "Where is a good place to set a cup of coffee while relaxing?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) coffee shop (B) kitchen (C) hand (D) table (E) office", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. table\nExplanation: A table is a more plausible answer as it provides a stable surface to set the cup of coffee on while relaxing. A coffee shop or office may have tables available, but a kitchen may not always be the most comfortable or relaxing place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee. Holding the cup in hand may also not be the most comfortable or practical option for extended periods of relaxation."}}
{"Q": "If a fried egg was runny and there was no toast to sop it up, after the meal there'd be a messy what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) henhouse (B) garden (C) plate (D) supermarket (E) bird's nest", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (C) plate, as a runny egg would likely leave a mess on the plate if there was no toast to soak it up. The other options, such as henhouse, garden, supermarket, and bird's nest, do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "If I want to behave with proper aplomb, what manners should I avoid?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) inappropriate (B) incomplete (C) impolite (D) none (E) incorrect", "R": {"text": "Answer: (C) impolite\nExplanation: Aplomb refers to behaving in a confident and composed manner, especially in difficult situations. To exhibit proper aplomb, one should avoid impolite manners such as interrupting others, speaking rudely, or being disrespectful. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "Before lifting weights he liked to warm up on the squash court, he really enjoyed the facilities of the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) swimming pool (B) rich person's house (C) country club (D) fitness center (E) park", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) fitness center\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that he likes to warm up on the squash court before lifting weights, which suggests that he is at a place where there are both a squash court and weightlifting equipment. The most likely place for this would be a fitness center, which typically has a variety of exercise facilities. The other options, such as a swimming pool or a park, do not necessarily have weightlifting equipment or squash courts readily available. The option of a rich person's house or country club may have these facilities, but it is less likely that the sentence would mention them in such a casual way."}}
{"Q": "What will happen to animals after eating food?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bite (B) digestion (C) feel pleasure (D) pass water (E) listen to each other", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. digestion\nExplanation: After animals eat food, it goes through the process of digestion where it is broken down and absorbed by the body for energy and nutrients. This is a natural process that occurs in all animals, including humans. Choices A, C, D, and E are not relevant to the process of eating and digesting food."}}
{"Q": "If I wanted to grow plants, where could I put a lot of dirt?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) corner (B) street (C) closet (D) garden (E) bathtub", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. garden\nExplanation: A garden is a designated area for growing plants and is typically filled with soil or dirt. It provides ample space for plants to grow and allows for proper drainage and sunlight. A corner, street, closet, or bathtub would not be suitable locations for growing plants due to lack of space, proper drainage, and sunlight."}}
{"Q": "What does a person often feel about someone judging them guilty?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) controversy (B) responsibility (C) resentment (D) judge feelings (E) hurt feelings", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. resentment\nExplanation: When someone judges a person guilty, they often feel resentment towards that person. This is because being judged guilty can feel like an attack on one's character and can be seen as unfair or unjust. The person may feel angry or bitter towards the person who judged them guilty, and may even hold a grudge."}}
{"Q": "A town between two mountains is located in a what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) valley (B) hospital (C) state (D) train station (E) michigan", "R": {"text": "Answer: A) valley\nExplanation: A town located between two mountains is most likely situated in a valley, which is a low area of land between two higher points. This is a common geographical feature and makes the most sense as an answer choice. The other options, such as hospital, state, train station, and Michigan, do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "James need to use a toilet but there were no public ones in sight.  Eventually he broke down and did something very expensive so that he could get a toilet.  Where might he have gone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) motel room (B) apartment (C) bathroom (D) games (E) house", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. motel room\nExplanation: Motel rooms often have private bathrooms for guests, making them a plausible option for someone in need of a toilet. While apartments and houses may also have bathrooms, they are not typically accessible to the public. \"Bathroom\" is too general of an answer and does not specify where the bathroom is located. \"Games\" is not a relevant option for finding a toilet."}}
{"Q": "Why did the heavy metal band need electricity at the stadium?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) concert (B) bedroom (C) make person sick (D) building (E) church", "R": {"text": "Answer: Concert.\nExplanation: Heavy metal bands typically perform at concerts, which require electricity to power their instruments and sound equipment. A bedroom, building, or church may also have electricity, but it is not necessary for the same purpose as a concert. Making a person sick has nothing to do with the need for electricity."}}
{"Q": "What is a person looking for when completing puzzles or riddles?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) avoid pain (B) compliments (C) intellectual challenge (D) passing grade (E) attention", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. intellectual challenge.\nExplanation: People who enjoy completing puzzles or riddles are often seeking a mental challenge and the satisfaction of solving a problem. They may enjoy the feeling of accomplishment that comes with figuring out a difficult puzzle or riddle. While some people may enjoy receiving compliments or attention for their puzzle-solving abilities, these are not typically the primary motivations for completing puzzles or riddles. Similarly, avoiding pain or earning a passing grade are not typically associated with puzzle-solving activities."}}
{"Q": "If someone was making breakfast, they'd probably put two slices of bread in the what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) plastic bag (B) pantry (C) supermarket (D) toaster (E) prison", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Toaster.\nExplanation: Toaster is the most plausible answer as it is the appliance used to toast bread. Placing two slices of bread in a plastic bag or pantry would not make sense, and a supermarket is a place to buy groceries, not to make breakfast. Prison is also an unlikely option as it is not a place where someone would typically make breakfast."}}
{"Q": "His house was a mess, he began doing housework to get what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) boredom (B) nice home (C) michigan (D) feeling satisfied (E) house clean", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (D) feeling satisfied. The sentence implies that the person's house was messy and needed cleaning. By doing housework, the person would feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in having a clean and organized home. The other options, such as boredom, Michigan, and a nice home, do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Where would a corpse be covered by a blanket?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) bath store (B) bedroom (C) hospital (D) flower garden (E) michigan", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. hospital\nExplanation: It is common practice in hospitals to cover a deceased person with a blanket as a sign of respect and to maintain their dignity. In a bath store or flower garden, it would be highly unlikely to find a corpse, and in a bedroom, it would depend on the circumstances of the death. Michigan is a state and not a location where a corpse would typically be covered by a blanket."}}
{"Q": "The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) accelerate (B) putting together (C) working (D) construct (E) train", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The person in the car was trying to kill the man, so it would make sense for them to accelerate and try to catch up to him. None of the other choices make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The trucker plopped on the bench with a sense of relief, where did he arrive?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) bordello (B) rest area (C) garden (D) bus stop (E) state park", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (B) rest area because it is a common place for truckers to take a break and rest during long drives. A bordello, garden, bus stop, or state park would not be typical places for a trucker to stop and take a break."}}
{"Q": "What is part of a republic like the USA?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) state (B) democratic (C) kingdom (D) democracy (E) dictatorship", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. state\nExplanation: A republic like the USA is composed of individual states that have their own governments and laws, but are united under a federal government. This is a fundamental aspect of the US political system and distinguishes it from a unitary state or a kingdom. While the US is also a democracy, this is not the defining characteristic of a republic."}}
{"Q": "Where do you keep extra clothing on a hike?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) person (B) hamper (C) closet (D) upstairs (E) backpack", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. backpack\nExplanation: When going on a hike, it is common to bring a backpack to carry necessary items such as water, snacks, and extra clothing. Therefore, it is more plausible to keep extra clothing in a backpack rather than a hamper, closet, or upstairs. While it is possible to keep extra clothing on your person, it may be uncomfortable or impractical to do so for an extended period of time."}}
{"Q": "What could an apple tree do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) new hampshire (B) bloom (C) washington state (D) sunshine (E) spontaneously combust", "R": {"text": "Answer: Bloom.\nExplanation: Apple trees are known for producing flowers in the spring, which eventually turn into apples. Therefore, it is plausible that an apple tree could bloom. The other options, such as New Hampshire and Washington State, are locations and not actions that an apple tree could take. Sunshine is a necessary factor for an apple tree to grow, but it is not something that the tree itself can do. Spontaneously combusting is not a natural or plausible action for an apple tree."}}
{"Q": "What very cold area in the east can a crab be found?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) fish market (B) shallow waters (C) atlantic ocean (D) fresh water (E) shore line", "R": {"text": "Answer: (C) Atlantic Ocean\nExplanation: Crabs can be found in the Atlantic Ocean, particularly in colder areas such as the northern Atlantic. They are often caught by fishermen and sold in fish markets, but they are not typically found in shallow waters or fresh water. While they may occasionally be found on the shoreline, the most likely place to find a crab in the east is in the Atlantic Ocean."}}
{"Q": "The chef wanted to perfect his craft, what did he do?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) thin potatos (B) prepare food (C) study french cooking (D) drink (E) cook dinner", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. study french cooking.\nExplanation: If the chef wanted to perfect his craft, he would likely seek to improve his skills and knowledge in the culinary arts. Studying French cooking, which is known for its precision and attention to detail, would be a logical step for a chef looking to improve their craft. Thin potatoes, preparing food, and cooking dinner are all tasks that a chef would already be doing as part of their job, so they wouldn't necessarily lead to significant improvement. Drinking may actually hinder the chef's ability to improve their skills."}}
{"Q": "She wanted a kitten and puppy so why did she only get the puppy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) one choice for pet (B) cute (C) kennel (D) soft (E) waxy", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. one choice for pet.\nExplanation: The sentence states that she wanted both a kitten and a puppy, but it doesn't mention any reason why she couldn't have both. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that she was only allowed to choose one pet, and she chose the puppy."}}
{"Q": "There was no shade for Jenny.  She was forced to lie there exposed to what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) full sunlight (B) bright sunshine (C) sunny place (D) eat cake (E) direct sunlight", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: The sentence states that there was no shade for Jenny, which means she was not protected from the sun. The most plausible answer would be \"direct sunlight\" as it accurately describes the situation of Jenny being exposed to the sun without any shade. The other options, such as \"full sunlight,\" \"bright sunshine,\" and \"sunny place,\" are similar in meaning but do not specifically convey the idea of direct exposure to the sun. Option D, \"eat cake,\" is clearly not a relevant answer."}}
{"Q": "What could happen to you after you are cleaning house for a long time?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) neatness (B) tiredness (C) order (D) exhaustion (E) sneezing", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Cleaning house for a long time can be physically demanding and can lead to exhaustion. This is especially true if you are doing tasks like scrubbing floors, lifting heavy objects, or moving furniture. It is important to take breaks and stay hydrated while cleaning to avoid exhaustion."}}
{"Q": "What is someone doing when scheduling when to go to party?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) rumpspringa (B) meeting new people (C) having fun (D) meet new people (E) plan", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. plan\nExplanation: When someone schedules when to go to a party, they are making plans for their attendance. They are deciding on a specific date and time to attend the party. Therefore, option E, \"plan,\" is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "What kind of path do comets tend to have?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) ice (B) set orbits (C) universe (D) space (E) solid nucleus", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Set orbits.\nExplanation: Comets tend to have set orbits around the sun, which can be predicted and observed. These orbits can be highly elliptical, meaning the comet spends most of its time far away from the sun and then swings in close for a brief period of time. The orbits of comets can be influenced by the gravity of other planets, causing them to change over time. However, they still follow a predictable path around the sun."}}
{"Q": "What do people feel after having sex that requires them to shower?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) bedroom (B) pleasant (C) obesity (D) painful (E) dirty", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. dirty\nExplanation: It is common for people to feel sweaty and sticky after having sex, which can make them feel dirty and in need of a shower. This is especially true if there was a lot of physical activity involved or if there was any bodily fluids exchanged. It is important to maintain good hygiene after sexual activity to prevent infections and promote overall health."}}
{"Q": "The vet found malignant tumors on the animals, what is their likely fate?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) euthanasia (B) pass water (C) die of cancer (D) feel pain (E) feel pleasure", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. die of cancer.\nExplanation: Malignant tumors are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body. If left untreated, the cancer can progress and ultimately lead to the animal's death. While euthanasia may be an option in some cases, it is not the only outcome for animals with cancer. Passing water, feeling pain, and feeling pleasure are not directly related to the presence of malignant tumors."}}
{"Q": "What is the thing that is agitated in your head when kissing?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) sexual stimulation (B) herpes (C) headache (D) catch cold (E) happiness", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: When kissing, the thing that is agitated in your head is most likely happiness. Kissing releases endorphins, which are feel-good hormones that can create a sense of pleasure and happiness. While sexual stimulation may also occur during kissing, it is not the only thing that is happening in the brain. Herpes, headache, and catching a cold are all possible negative outcomes of kissing, but they are not the thing that is being agitated in the head during the act itself."}}
{"Q": "Billy was reading the newspaper as he commuted to work, but once he got to his destination he balled it up and put it somewhere. Where did it put it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) trash (B) floor (C) subway (D) ground (E) lawn", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is common for people to dispose of newspapers in the trash after reading them, especially if they are commuting and do not have a designated recycling bin nearby. It is unlikely that Billy would have thrown the newspaper on the floor, subway, ground, or lawn as this would be littering and disrespectful to the environment."}}
{"Q": "Where do you keep a pail in your house?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) garage (B) pool (C) utility room (D) hardware store (E) wishing well", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. utility room\nExplanation: A pail is typically used for household chores such as cleaning or carrying items. The garage and pool are not common places to keep a pail unless it is specifically used for those areas. The hardware store is not a place to keep a pail, as it is a place to purchase one. A wishing well is not a practical place to keep a pail. The utility room, however, is a logical place to store cleaning supplies and tools, including a pail."}}
{"Q": "what is printed with ink and distributed daily?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) fountain pen (B) squid (C) newspaper (D) book (E) printer", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. newspaper.\nExplanation: Newspapers are printed with ink and distributed daily to provide news and information to readers. While fountain pens, books, and printers also use ink, they are not typically distributed daily like newspapers. Squid may release ink, but they are not printed or distributed for daily use."}}
{"Q": "What are people likely to do when an unexpected decent outcome occurs?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) kill each other (B) thank god (C) experience pain (D) hatred (E) talk to each other", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. talk to each other.\nExplanation: When an unexpected decent outcome occurs, people are likely to feel relieved and happy. This can lead to them wanting to share their experience with others and talk about what happened. It is a natural human tendency to want to share good news and positive experiences with others. Killing each other, experiencing pain, or feeling hatred are unlikely responses to a positive outcome. Thanking God may be a response for some individuals, but it is not a universal response."}}
{"Q": "The terrace had Kanji written on it, indicating that it was made where?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) japan (B) rice paddy (C) garden (D) michigan (E) italy", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Japan\nExplanation: Kanji is a system of writing used in Japan, so it is likely that the terrace with Kanji written on it was made in Japan. The other choices, such as rice paddy, garden, Michigan, and Italy, do not necessarily have a strong connection to Kanji or Japanese culture."}}
{"Q": "The company sent off many purchases, they used recycled cardboard as their what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) packaging materials (B) recycle bin (C) box factory (D) warehouse (E) bowler hats", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. packaging materials.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the company sent off many purchases, which implies that they needed to package the items for shipping. The fact that they used recycled cardboard suggests that they are environmentally conscious and are trying to reduce waste. Therefore, it is most likely that they used the recycled cardboard as packaging materials. The other options, such as a recycle bin, box factory, warehouse, or bowler hats, do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Why might a person be known as a liar?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) have no home (B) false information (C) hungry (D) made fun of (E) brain tumor", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) false information\nExplanation: A person may be known as a liar if they consistently provide false information or deceive others.

{"Q": "The man was giving assistance to a pan handler in the streets, how did he give assistance?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) feeling good (B) killing (C) law suits (D) out of pocket (E) feel loved", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) out of pocket\nExplanation: The phrase \"out of pocket\" typically means that someone is spending their own money to help someone else. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer for how the man gave assistance to the pan handler in the streets. The other options, such as \"killing\" and \"law suits,\" are clearly not appropriate actions for giving assistance. \"Feeling good\" and \"feel loved\" may be positive outcomes of giving assistance, but they do not describe the actual action taken by the man."}}

A brother's house or a party may also be possible, but they are not as specific to family gatherings as a family reunion. A family picture book and family tree are not physical locations where you can run into someone."}}

{"Q": "What uses a ribbon to put words on paper?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) wrapping paper (B) girl's hair (C) bath (D) floral arrangement (E) typewriter", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. typewriter\nExplanation: A typewriter uses a ribbon to put words on paper. The ribbon is a strip of inked fabric that is wound between two spools and moves as the keys are struck, leaving ink impressions on the paper. The other options, such as wrapping paper, girl's hair, bath, and floral arrangement, do not involve the use of a ribbon to put words on paper."}}
{"Q": "Where are sheep likely to live?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) school (B) meadow (C) lamb (D) farm (E) fairgrounds", "R": {"text": "Answer: (D) farm\nExplanation: Sheep are commonly raised on farms for their wool, meat, and milk.

Turning on the fan would help circulate the air and make the living room more comfortable. The other options (hockey game, bathroom, football stadium, hot room) do not fit the context of the scenario."}}
{"Q": "While walking the student needed to store his writing insturment away, where did he put it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) desk drawer (B) cabinet (C) purse (D) classroom (E) pocket", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. pocket\nExplanation: Since the student is walking, it is more likely that they would store their writing instrument in their pocket for easy access rather than in a desk drawer or cabinet. A purse may be a possibility if the student is carrying one, but it is not mentioned in the question. The classroom is too broad of a location and does not specify where in the classroom the student would store their writing instrument."}}
{"Q": "Who watches a play in an auditorium?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) building (B) crowd (C) city (D) group (E) high school", "R": {"text": "Answer: Group.\nExplanation: An auditorium is a place where people gather to watch a performance, such as a play or a concert. The most likely answer is \"group\" because it refers to a collection of individuals who have come together for a common purpose, in this case, to watch a play. The other choices, such as \"building,\" \"city,\" \"crowd,\" and \"high school,\" do not accurately describe who is watching the play in the auditorium."}}
{"Q": "What is a possible outcome for committing murder?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) problems (B) incarceration (C) trial (D) imprisonment (E) prosecution", "R": {"text": "Answer: D.

Kill animals.\nExplanation: Throughout history, humans have relied on hunting and gathering for food. While agriculture and other forms of food production have become more prevalent, many people still rely on hunting and fishing to provide for themselves and their families. Therefore, killing animals is a more plausible answer for what people do for food."}}
{"Q": "There was many a bottle to choose from behind the cashier where?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) grocery store (B) diaper bag (C) gas station (D) liquor store (E) medicine cabinet", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. liquor store.\nExplanation: The phrase \"many a bottle\" suggests a large selection of bottles, which is more likely to be found in a liquor store than in a grocery store, gas station, diaper bag, or medicine cabinet. Additionally, the fact that the bottles are behind the cashier further supports the idea that this is a retail establishment, rather than a personal item like a diaper bag or medicine cabinet."}}
{"Q": "They had to know where to go, they got on the national highway after consulting the what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) canada (B) atlas (C) united states (D) major cities (E) book", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (B) atlas, as an atlas is a book of maps that would provide directions and information on major highways and roads. It is common for travelers to consult an atlas or map when planning a route or navigating to a destination. Canada and the United States are countries, and major cities would not necessarily provide information on which highways to take. \"Book\" is too general and does not specify what type of book would be consulted for directions."}}
{"Q": "What do professors primarily do?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) master physics (B) state facts (C) wear wrinkled tweed jackets (D) school students (E) teach courses", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. Teach courses.\nExplanation: While some professors may specialize in a particular subject area, their primary role is to teach courses to students. They may also conduct research, advise students, and participate in academic committees, but teaching is a fundamental aspect of their job. While some professors may wear tweed jackets, this is not a defining characteristic of their profession."}}
{"Q": "Where do you throw a ball at pins?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bowling alley (B) football stadium (C) soccer field (D) sporting event (E) sporting goods store", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. bowling alley.\nExplanation: Bowling is a sport where players roll a ball down a lane to knock down pins at the end of the lane. This activity takes place in a bowling alley, which is specifically designed for this sport. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer. The other options, such as football stadium, soccer field, sporting event, and sporting goods store, do not involve the activity of throwing a ball at pins."}}
{"Q": "What might you need to do cleaning?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) sing a song (B) neatness (C) allergies (D) healthy living (E) using water", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. using water\nExplanation: Cleaning often involves the use of water to wash away dirt, dust, and other debris. While singing a song or striving for neatness may be helpful for motivation and organization, they are not essential for the act of cleaning itself. Allergies and healthy living may be factors to consider when choosing cleaning products, but they are not necessary for the act of cleaning itself."}}
{"Q": "If i were to spit a lot without noticing i may have extra what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) phlegm (B) saliva nd mouth (C) disease (D) germs (E) spittle", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. phlegm\nExplanation: Excessive spitting can be a symptom of increased production of phlegm in the respiratory system. Phlegm is a thick, sticky substance that is produced by the mucous membranes in the respiratory tract in response to inflammation or infection. If you are spitting a lot, it may be a sign that you have an underlying respiratory condition that is causing an increase in phlegm production. It is important to consult a healthcare professional if you are experiencing excessive spitting or coughing up phlegm."}}

{"Q": "What is the animal trying to accomplish?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) sand trap (B) live long (C) leave home (D) feel pain (E) eating", "R": {"text": "Answer: Eating.\nExplanation: The animal's goal is to satisfy its hunger by eating. This is a basic survival instinct for most animals, and it is necessary for them to consume food in order to live and thrive. The other options, such as sand trap or leaving home, do not make sense in the context of an animal's basic needs and instincts."}}
{"Q": "James and Holly went dancing together. As they danced, he  pressed himself against her what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) euphoria (B) moving body (C) rhythmic movement (D) happiness (E) fatigue", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. rhythmic movement.\nExplanation: The phrase \"pressed himself against her\" suggests that James was dancing closely with Holly, and the word \"rhythmic\" implies that they were moving in sync with the music. Option A, euphoria, and option D, happiness, suggest emotional states rather than physical movements. Option B, moving body, is too general and doesn't specifically describe the interaction between James and Holly. Option E, fatigue, is unlikely given that they are dancing together and presumably enjoying themselves. Therefore, option C, rhythmic movement, is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "If a house has a subscription, what likely shows up in the driveway every morning?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) subdivision (B) newspaper (C) street (D) laundry mat (E) surface of earth", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. newspaper.\nExplanation: If a house has a subscription, it is likely that a newspaper will show up in the driveway every morning. This is a common practice for newspaper delivery services. The other options, such as subdivision, street, laundry mat, and surface of earth, do not make sense in this context."}}

Therefore, the person was worried about their energy levels for participating in wrestling."}}
{"Q": "what does a person do to stay healthy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) fever (B) eat every day (C) excited (D) headache (E) expressive", "R": {"text": "Answer: Eat every day.\nExplanation: Eating a balanced diet every day is essential for maintaining good health.

{"Q": "Who is the guard here for?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) man post (B) attack (C) intimidation (D) prisoner (E) unprotected", "R": {"text": "Answer: Prisoner.\nExplanation: The presence of a guard usually indicates that there is someone or something that needs to be protected or monitored. In this case, the most plausible answer is that the guard is there for a prisoner. The other options, such as man post, attack, intimidation, and unprotected, do not provide a clear reason for why a guard would be necessary."}}
{"Q": "If a person stutters when he experiences anxiety or excitement, he'll have difficult doing what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) express information (B) dance (C) library (D) go somewhere (E) study", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. express information.\nExplanation: Stuttering is a speech disorder that affects a person's ability to speak fluently. When a person experiences anxiety or excitement, their stuttering may become more pronounced, making it difficult for them to express information clearly and effectively. Dancing, going to the library, going somewhere, or studying may not necessarily be affected by stuttering, but expressing information through speech can be a challenge for someone who stutters."}}
{"Q": "Where can you keep letter opener when it likely to be needed soon?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) office supply store (B) stationery store (C) dek (D) martyr's chest (E) refrigerator", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. Desk.\nExplanation: Keeping a letter opener in a desk is a common and practical solution as it is easily accessible when needed for opening letters or packages. It is also a logical place to store office supplies and stationery. The other options, such as an office supply store or refrigerator, are not practical or logical places to keep a personal letter opener. A stationery store may sell letter openers, but it is not a place to store them for personal use. A martyr's chest is not a common item and would not be a practical place to store a letter opener."}}
{"Q": "Danny found that the carpet did not ,match the drapes, which was disappointing, because this place was expensive.  But it was the only place in town that wasn't booked solid for the week and he needed it while he was in town, so he couldn't complain.   Where might this place be?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) brothel (B) restaurant (C) building (D) bowling alley (E) at hotel", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. \nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the place is a hotel. The fact that it was expensive and the only place in town that wasn't fully booked suggests that it is a popular accommodation option. The mention of the carpet and drapes also suggests that it is a place where guests stay overnight, such as a hotel. The other options, such as a brothel or bowling alley, are less likely to be expensive and fully booked, and the mention of the carpet and drapes would be less relevant."}}
{"Q": "What do people need to do to change their lives?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) face problems (B) better themselves (C) pay bills (D) become disillusioned (E) eat chicken", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. better themselves.\nExplanation: In order to change their lives, people need to focus on self-improvement and personal growth. This can involve setting goals, learning new skills, and making positive changes to their habits and behaviors. While facing problems and paying bills are important aspects of life, they are not necessarily the key to making significant changes and achieving long-term success. Becoming disillusioned may lead to a desire for change, but it is not a proactive or productive approach. Eating chicken, while delicious, is not relevant to changing one's life."}}
{"Q": "Humans need shelter to survive.

{"Q": "Someone who had a very bad flight might be given a trip in this to make up for it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) first class (B) propitious (C) reputable (D) one (E) sufficient", "R": {"text": "Answer: First class.\nExplanation: If someone had a very bad flight, it is possible that the airline or travel company may offer them a trip in first class as a way to make up for the bad experience. First class is a higher level of service and comfort than economy class, and it could be seen as a way to compensate for the inconvenience or discomfort of a bad flight. The other answer choices do not make sense in this context. \"Propitious\" means favorable or lucky, but it does not relate to travel or compensation. \"Reputable\" means having a good reputation, but it does not relate to making up for a bad flight. \"One\" and \"sufficient\" are too vague and do not provide any specific solution or compensation for a bad flight."}}
{"Q": "Nature can be good and bad for the person who walks, what are some things?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) seeing bear (B) see beautiful views (C) get wet (D) getting lost (E) murdered by a landshark", "R": {"text": "Answer: A and C.\nExplanation: Seeing a bear can be dangerous and scary for a person who is walking in nature. Getting wet can also be uncomfortable and potentially lead to hypothermia if not properly prepared. However, seeing beautiful views can be a positive experience and getting lost can be an opportunity for adventure and exploration if the person is prepared and has the necessary skills. Option E is not a plausible answer as landsharks do not exist in reality."}}
{"Q": "Jim decided to lose weight.  He thought that exercise is the best way to lose weight because you can't get rid of what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) need for food (B) fitness (C) sweating (D) fastfood (E) thirst", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. need for food\nExplanation: Exercise can help burn calories and increase metabolism, but ultimately weight loss also requires a reduction in calorie intake.

{"Q": "Nature creates more beautiful structures than those that are what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) artificial (B) indoors (C) city (D) man made (E) eat cake", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. man made\nExplanation: Nature has a way of creating intricate and awe-inspiring structures that are often unmatched by anything man-made. From the intricate patterns of a snowflake to the grandeur of a mountain range, nature's beauty is unparalleled. While man-made structures can be impressive, they often lack the organic beauty and complexity found in nature."}}
{"Q": "The water in clouds turn in to what when it gets cold?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) typhoon (B) snowflake (C) laddle (D) teardrops (E) sink", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When the water in clouds gets cold, it turns into snowflakes. This is because the water molecules freeze and form ice crystals, which then combine to form snowflakes.

{"Q": "When going to sleep what happens to your body?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) snoring (B) latency (C) dreams (D) relaxation (E) dreaming", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Relaxation.\nExplanation: When going to sleep, the body goes through a process of relaxation. The muscles in the body become less tense, the heart rate slows down, and breathing becomes more regular. This relaxation allows the body to enter a state of rest and repair, which is essential for overall health and well-being. While snoring and dreaming may occur during sleep, they are not necessarily a universal experience and do not happen to everyone. Latency refers to the time it takes to fall asleep, which is also a part of the process of relaxation."}}
{"Q": "Where is a monkey likely to enjoy being?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) banana tree (B) sailor suit (C) theatre (D) mulberry bush (E) research laboratory", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Banana tree.\nExplanation: Monkeys are known to love bananas, so it is likely that they would enjoy being in a place where they can easily access and eat bananas, such as a banana tree. The other options, such as a sailor suit, theatre, mulberry bush, or research laboratory, do not provide any clear benefit or enjoyment for a monkey."}}
{"Q": "What is a form of anaerobic exercising?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) shortness of breath (B) lift weights (C) error (D) fall down (E) run", "R": {"text": "Answer: Lift weights.\nExplanation: Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that involves short bursts of intense activity, such as weightlifting or sprinting, that do not rely on oxygen for energy. Shortness of breath and falling down are not forms of exercise, and \"error\" is not a relevant option. Running can be both aerobic and anaerobic depending on the intensity and duration. Therefore, the most plausible answer is lifting weights as it is a common form of anaerobic exercise."}}
{"Q": "The earth is one planet in what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) tree (B) orbit (C) solar system (D) fotograph (E) dreams", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. solar system.\nExplanation: The earth is one planet in our solar system, which consists of eight planets, including Earth, and their respective moons, as well as other celestial bodies such as asteroids and comets. The solar system is a collection of celestial objects that orbit around the sun, which is at the center of the system. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer. Options A, D, and E are not related to the earth's position in the universe, and option B is incomplete as it does not specify what the earth is in orbit around."}}
{"Q": "Where would you put a container can after you buy it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) pantry (B) store (C) gas (D) liquid (E) garage", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.

{"Q": "Where did you meet your best friend since Kindergarten?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) friend's house (B) school (C) fraternity house (D) internet cafe (E) airplane", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. school.\nExplanation: It is more likely that someone would meet their best friend since Kindergarten at school, as they would have been in the same class or classes together for several years. The other options, such as meeting at a fraternity house or an internet cafe, are less likely scenarios for a friendship that has lasted since childhood."}}
{"Q": "James was below the balloon.  He watched it rise.

Envy and jealousy may occur if someone is comparing their own gifts to others, but it is not the most plausible answer in this scenario. Education and fear are not relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Joe's cat smelled something delicious and jumped into this, causing him to panic and fear for its life. Where might it have jumped?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) meat loaf (B) bedroom (C) microwave (D) living room (E) floor", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. meat loaf\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cat jumped into a meat loaf, as cats are known to be attracted to the smell of meat. Jumping into a bedroom, living room, or onto the floor would not necessarily cause panic and fear for the cat's life. Jumping into a microwave would be dangerous for the cat, but it is unlikely that the cat would be able to open the microwave on its own."}}

He was really troubled  and fearful because of what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) happiness (B) problems (C) prosecution (D) distress (E) misery", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: James was troubled and fearful because he knew that committing murder was a crime and he could face prosecution if caught.

Among the given choices, sandplain is the most plausible option as it is a flat and sandy area that can extend to the coast.

This can be done by finding a higher paying job, taking on a second job, or starting a side business. Ignoring the problem or throwing a party will not solve the issue, and while acknowledging the problem is important, it is not a solution in itself.

However, his agreement that it was \"unlikely\" indicates that he recognizes the difficulty or unlikelihood of the situation.

{"Q": "What was the man encouraged to do after he expressed his anger violently?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cool off (B) punch (C) illustrate point (D) fight (E) release energy", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. cool off\nExplanation: When someone expresses their anger violently, it is important for them to take a step back and cool off. This can help them to calm down and think more clearly about the situation. Punching, fighting, or releasing energy in a violent way is not a healthy or productive way to deal with anger. Illustrating a point may be a more constructive way to express oneself, but it still may not be the best option in a situation where emotions are running high. Therefore, cooling off is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where can a student learn to play a triangle?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) math class (B) math book (C) in pythagorus' band (D) orchestra (E) music class", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Orchestra.\nExplanation: The triangle is a percussion instrument commonly used in orchestras. Therefore, it is most likely that a student would learn to play the triangle in an orchestra setting, rather than in a math class or book, or in Pythagoras' band (which is not a real band). Music class is also a plausible answer, but the specificity of the question suggests that the answer should be more specific to the instrument."}}
{"Q": "What do you need to do to use television if it is already turned on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) get wet (B) open eyes (C) kill (D) plug in (E) first turn on power", "R": {"text": "Answer: Open eyes.\nExplanation: To use television if it is already turned on, you need to open your eyes to see the screen and watch whatever is being broadcasted. Getting wet, killing, or plugging in are not relevant actions to using a television that is already turned on. And if the television is already turned on, then the power is already on, so there is no need to first turn on the power."}}
{"Q": "The guys had a regular poker game, rather than going to the movies this what their what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) competition (B) fun game (C) losing money (D) fun (E) social event", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. social event\nExplanation: The fact that the guys had a regular poker game suggests that it was a recurring event that they looked forward to. Additionally, the use of the word \"regular\" implies that it was more than just a one-time competition or fun game. Going to the movies could also be considered a social event, but the fact that they chose to have a regular poker game instead suggests that it was a preferred activity for them to socialize and spend time together."}}
{"Q": "When you stroke a dogs fur what have you done?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) start fighting (B) play (C) lots of attention (D) petted (E) bone", "R": {"text": "Answer: Petted.\nExplanation: When you stroke a dog's fur, you are giving them affection and attention by gently running your hand over their coat.

He did this because he was what than ever before?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) kitchen (B) drunker (C) tavern (D) restaurant (E) shorter", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (B) drunker, as falling off a bar stool is a common occurrence for someone who has had too much to drink. The other options (A) kitchen, (C) tavern, (D) restaurant, and (E) shorter do not provide a logical explanation for why Dan fell off the bar stool."}}
{"Q": "The wood was still rough to the touch, what did the woodworker have to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) petrify (B) sanded (C) warp (D) composted (E) clean", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. sanded.\nExplanation: Sanding is a common technique used by woodworkers to smooth out rough surfaces. It involves using sandpaper or a sanding machine to remove the rough outer layer of the wood, leaving a smooth and polished finish. Petrifying, warping, composting, and cleaning are not relevant actions for smoothing rough wood."}}
{"Q": "The chief saw his entire tribe wiped out, he was a leader with a single what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) peon (B) indian (C) minister (D) follower (E) employee", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. follower\nExplanation: The word \"chief\" implies that he was a leader of a group, and the fact that his entire tribe was wiped out suggests that he had followers. The other options (peon, Indian, minister, employee) do not accurately describe the relationship between a chief and his people."}}
{"Q": "The flower grew tall to compete for sunlight, what did its neighbor do?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) blossom (B) park (C) open (D) cast shadow (E) vase", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The neighbor of the tall-growing flower would most likely cast a shadow, as it is also trying to grow and compete for sunlight. This is a common occurrence in nature, where plants and trees will grow taller to reach sunlight, and their neighbors will adjust their growth patterns to avoid being overshadowed."}}
{"Q": "If while driving to work another car makes a careless maneuver, what emotion might you feel?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) boredom (B) happiness (C) transportation cost (D) getting there (E) road rage", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Road rage is the most plausible emotion that one might feel in this situation. A careless maneuver by another driver can be frustrating and dangerous, leading to anger and aggression towards the other driver. This can result in road rage, which is a common problem on the roads and can lead to accidents and other negative consequences."}}
{"Q": "What kind of food makes someone sick?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) boat (B) necessary to live (C) edible (D) unhealthy (E) kitchen", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. unhealthy\nExplanation: Unhealthy food can contain harmful bacteria, viruses, or toxins that can make someone sick.

{"Q": "Where would you find the sharpest parts of a triangle?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) three vertices (B) point (C) 3 sides (D) three sides (E) math book", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. three vertices\nExplanation: The vertices of a triangle are the points where the three sides meet. These points are also known as the corners of the triangle. Since the vertices are the sharpest points of the triangle, they are the correct answer to this question. The sides and points of a triangle may also be sharp, but they are not as sharp as the vertices. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How might a automobile get off a freeway?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) exit ramp (B) garage (C) driveway (D) repair shop (E) stop light", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Exit ramp.\nExplanation: An exit ramp is a designated route for vehicles to leave a freeway or highway. It allows drivers to safely slow down and exit the freeway at a lower speed. Garages, driveways, and repair shops are not typically located directly off of freeways, and stop lights are not a designated exit route. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A, exit ramp."}}
{"Q": "What does going to bed with your spouse for sex lead to?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) bad dreams (B) a good nights sleep (C) rest (D) sleepiness (E) get pregnant", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. a good night's sleep.\nExplanation: Going to bed with your spouse for sex can lead to physical and emotional intimacy, which can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. This can lead to a better quality of sleep, resulting in feeling more rested and refreshed in the morning. While getting pregnant is a possibility, it is not a guaranteed outcome and requires additional factors such as timing and fertility. Bad dreams and sleepiness are not necessarily related to sexual activity with a spouse."}}
{"Q": "What would it be if they get a surprising show over and over?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) surprise (B) fight (C) annoyance (D) might scare (E) irritated", "R": {"text": "Answer: Annoyance.\nExplanation: If someone keeps getting a surprising show over and over, it is likely to become annoying rather than surprising or scary. The repetition of the surprise would lose its effect and become a nuisance."}}

If she pushed more what might happen?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) pressure (B) trying harder (C) put harder (D) enemies (E) death", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. trying harder.\nExplanation: If Sally pushed more, she might try harder to compete and overcome her fears and doubts. It is unlikely that she would face pressure, put harder, or make enemies. Death is not a plausible outcome in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "John is sitting in a toilet stall in a bathroom, outside he can hear cars going around in circles.  What is the function of the place he is most likely at?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) eating food (B) public place (C) race track (D) at hotel (E) public building", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The sound of cars going around in circles suggests that John is at a race track or some other location where cars are being driven in circles, such as a go-kart track. This is not likely to be a hotel or a public building, and it is unlikely that he would be eating food in a toilet stall. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that he is at a race track."}}
{"Q": "What event might one buy tickets for seats?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) park (B) show (C) auditorium (D) movies (E) rest area", "R": {"text": "Answer: Show.\nExplanation: One would typically buy tickets for seats to attend a show, such as a concert, theater performance, or comedy show. Parks and rest areas do not typically require tickets for seating, while auditoriums and movie theaters may have assigned seating but tickets are usually purchased for the event being held in the space. However, shows are the most common event for which one would buy tickets for seats."}}
{"Q": "The merchant wanted to open in a high-traffic space, where did he rent space?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) mall (B) business (C) store (D) sale (E) sell goods", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. mall\nExplanation: A mall is typically a high-traffic space with many stores and shoppers, making it an ideal location for a merchant looking to attract customers. Business and store are too general and could refer to any type of location, while sale and sell goods are not locations at all."}}
{"Q": "The newlyweds began copulating their marriage, they wanted many what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) babies (B) odors (C) sadness (D) rapport (E) ejaculation", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. babies.\nExplanation: The word \"copulating\" refers to sexual intercourse, which is often associated with procreation and having children. Therefore, it is likely that the newlyweds wanted to have babies. The other options, such as odors, sadness, rapport, and ejaculation, do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "How does a planet usually move around the sun?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) writing (B) universe (C) outer space (D) outerspace (E) orbit", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: A planet usually moves around the sun in an orbit, which is a path that is determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.

{"Q": "When a group of people are talking at work they might be doing what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) having a concert. (B) cough (C) sharing of ideas (D) speak (E) sneeze", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. sharing of ideas.\nExplanation: When a group of people are talking at work, it is most likely that they are sharing ideas, discussing work-related topics, or having a meeting. A concert or coughing/sneezing would not be appropriate in a work setting. Speaking is a general term that could apply to any situation, but sharing of ideas specifically relates to a work environment."}}
{"Q": "What emotion leads to punching?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) fists (B) hitting (C) boxing gloves (D) anger (E) hands", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Anger is the emotion that often leads to punching. When someone is angry, they may feel the need to release their frustration physically, which can result in punching. Fists, hitting, and hands are all physical actions that can be used to punch, but they are not emotions. Boxing gloves are a tool used in the sport of boxing, but they do not necessarily lead to punching outside of the ring."}}
{"Q": "They kept doing things the same, she suggested they also try doing things what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) differently (B) otherwise (C) expensive (D) only (E) mere", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The word \"also\" suggests that the suggestion is to do something in addition to what they were already doing. The word \"differently\" is the most appropriate choice as it means to do things in a different way."}}
{"Q": "Where could you find a shark before it was caught?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) pool hall (B) tomales bay (C) marine museum (D) business (E) desert", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. marine museum\nExplanation: Sharks are typically found in bodies of water such as oceans, seas, and rivers. Therefore, it is most likely that a shark would be found in a place that is related to marine life, such as a marine museum. The other options, such as a pool hall, desert, or business, are not suitable habitats for sharks. Tamales Bay is a body of water, but it is not known for having a large population of sharks."}}
{"Q": "Where is one likely to find poker chips?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) supermarket (B) pantry (C) motherboard (D) bar (E) bar", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. bar\nExplanation: Poker chips are commonly used in gambling games, particularly in poker. Bars often have poker nights or other events where gambling is involved, making it a more likely place to find poker chips compared to a supermarket or pantry. A motherboard is a computer component and has no relation to poker chips. The option \"E\" is a duplicate of \"D\"."}}
{"Q": "Dance can be elegant and specific, or you can just have fun and what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) falling down (B) trip (C) fall down (D) move around (E) celebrate", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. move around.\nExplanation: While dancing can certainly involve elegance and precision, it can also be a fun and freeform activity where you simply move around to the music. Choices A, B, and C suggest clumsiness or accidents, which are not necessarily inherent to dancing. Choice E suggests a specific type of celebration, which may not be applicable to all types of dancing. Therefore, D is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where can one obtain a bass fiddle?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) jazz band (B) string quartet (C) group band (D) nursery rhyme (E) music store", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. music store\nExplanation: A bass fiddle, also known as a double bass or upright bass, is a common instrument found in many genres of music, including jazz, classical, and rock. While it is possible to find a bass fiddle in a jazz band, string quartet, or group band, the most likely place to obtain one is at a music store. Music stores specialize in selling a variety of instruments, including bass fiddles, and often have a range of options to choose from. Additionally, music stores may offer rental options for those who are not ready to commit to purchasing a bass fiddle outright."}}
{"Q": "Why does having a disability sometimes making academic tasks hard for a person?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) mentally challenged (B) have choice (C) lots of space (D) hungry (E) acknowledgment", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Having a disability can affect a person's cognitive abilities, making it harder for them to process information, understand instructions, and complete academic tasks.

It is important to provide accommodations and support to help individuals with disabilities succeed academically."}}
{"Q": "What is the purpose of playing games for children?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) winning (B) learning (C) losing (D) fatigue (E) skill", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The purpose of playing games for children is primarily learning. Through games, children can develop various skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, social skills, and physical coordination. Winning and losing are secondary to the learning experience, and games should not be played to the point of fatigue. Developing skills is the primary goal of playing games for children."}}

{"Q": "If someone laughs after surprising them they have a good sense of what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) joy (B) fight (C) frightened (D) humor (E) laughter", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: If someone laughs after being surprised, it indicates that they have a good sense of humor. This means that they are able to find amusement or enjoyment in unexpected situations, which is a positive trait."}}
{"Q": "People played a variety of games in the soccer field.  It was the closest thing they had to what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) town (B) beach (C) park (D) near (E) outside", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that people played games in a soccer field, which suggests that the location was a recreational area. Among the choices, only \"park\" fits this description. \"Town\" and \"near\" are too general, \"beach\" is unlikely as it is not mentioned in the sentence, and \"outside\" is too vague. Therefore, the closest thing to a soccer field where people played games is a park."}}
{"Q": "What is likely to have a better school cafeteria?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) high school (B) canteen (C) polytechnic (D) large room (E) all kinds of schools", "R": {"text": "Answer: Polytechnic.\nExplanation: Polytechnics are institutions that offer technical and vocational education, and they often have a focus on practical skills and hands-on learning. As such, they may have a better-equipped cafeteria that caters to the needs of students who are studying subjects like culinary arts, hospitality, and food science. Additionally, polytechnics may have more resources to invest in their cafeteria facilities and staff, as they often receive funding from industry partners and government agencies. While it's possible that other types of schools may also have good cafeterias, polytechnics are likely to have a better one due to their focus on practical skills and industry partnerships."}}
{"Q": "When someone has little knowledge and is judging someone they are considered what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) objectivity (B) knowing yourself (C) experience (D) ignorance (E) introduction", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. ignorance\nExplanation: When someone has little knowledge and is judging someone, they are considered ignorant.

{"Q": "She wanted to get in shape, but she couldn't stay focused on the hour long what?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) sweating (B) excercise (C) work out (D) video (E) swim", "R": {"text": "Answer: C\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the woman wanted to get in shape but had trouble staying focused on something for an hour. The most plausible answer is \"work out\" as it is a common phrase used to describe physical activity aimed at improving fitness. The other options, such as \"sweating\" and \"exercise,\" are too general and do not provide enough context to fully understand what the woman was struggling with. \"Video\" and \"swim\" are also unlikely options as they do not fit with the rest of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "When you do something and have fun, its something you?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) spontaneous (B) stop working (C) pay for (D) do like (E) do enjoy", "R": {"text": "Answer: (E) do enjoy\nExplanation: When you do something and have fun, it means you enjoy doing it.

This involves identifying potential customers, presenting the product or service in a compelling way, and closing the sale. While traveling to different locations and servicing accounts may be part of the job, the ultimate goal is to generate sales and revenue for the company. Getting fired or dealing with books may be secondary responsibilities, but not the primary responsibility of a salesman."}}
{"Q": "How does going jogging generally affect one's self esteem?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) feel better (B) feel pride (C) sweating (D) ocean (E) arthritis", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. feel better.\nExplanation: Going jogging generally has a positive effect on one's self esteem as it releases endorphins, which are known to improve mood and reduce stress. This can lead to an overall feeling of well-being and a boost in self-confidence. Sweating and arthritis may be physical effects of jogging, but they do not necessarily have a direct impact on self esteem. Ocean is not related to jogging or self esteem. Feeling pride may be a result of achieving a personal goal while jogging, but it is not a general effect that applies to everyone. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find people standing in a line outside?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bus depot (B) end of line (C) opera (D) neighbor's house (E) meeting", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Bus depot.\nExplanation: People often stand in a line outside a bus depot waiting for their bus to arrive. The other options, such as end of line, opera, neighbor's house, and meeting, do not necessarily require people to stand in a line outside."}}

Therefore, if you want to find the meaning of \"ficus,\" you would consult a dictionary. The other options, such as apartment, library, and Middle East, are not relevant to finding the meaning of a word. An arboretum may have ficus trees, but it would not necessarily provide the meaning of the word \"ficus.\""}}
{"Q": "When are people buying products more?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) debt (B) economic boom (C) being able to use (D) disagreements (E) trading", "R": {"text": "Answer: Economic boom.\nExplanation: During an economic boom, people tend to have more disposable income and are more willing to spend money on products.

{"Q": "The buildings were intended to not have residential kitchens in them, what were they designed for?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) large city (B) small (C) eat cake (D) university (E) town", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. university\nExplanation: The fact that the buildings were not intended to have residential kitchens suggests that they were designed for a setting where people would not be living permanently, but rather for a temporary or communal living situation. Universities often have dormitories or other types of student housing where students live for a few years, but typically do not have full kitchens in their individual rooms. Instead, they may have communal kitchens or dining halls where meals are prepared and served. Therefore, it is more plausible that the buildings were designed for a university setting."}}
{"Q": "Animals come in all types, some fly thanks to their lightweight hollow what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) tails (B) bones (C) eyes (D) heads (E) bodies", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Animals that fly, such as birds and bats, have lightweight hollow bones that allow them to be light enough to take off and stay in the air.

{"Q": "The child felt like it was all pretend, he didn't understand what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) people believe (B) daydreams (C) transcendentalism (D) laughter (E) religion", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. people believe\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the child feels like everything around him is not real or genuine. The phrase \"it was all pretend\" implies that he thinks people are pretending or not being truthful. Option A, \"people believe,\" fits this context as it suggests that the child doesn't understand why people believe in things that he perceives as fake or pretend. The other options, such as daydreams, transcendentalism, laughter, and religion, do not fit the context as well."}}
{"Q": "Where is a lake likely to be glacial?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) michigan (B) new york (C) new york (D) mountains (E) countryside", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. mountains\nExplanation: Glaciers are formed in areas with high elevation and cold temperatures, such as mountains. Lakes in mountainous regions are more likely to be glacial in origin due to the presence of glaciers that can carve out basins and deposit sediment to form lakes. Michigan and New York are states with many lakes, but they are not necessarily glacial in origin. The countryside is too broad of a term to determine the likelihood of a lake being glacial."}}
{"Q": "They needed grape juice for their party, they went to buy it and other snacks at the what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) field (B) restaurant (C) salad (D) market (E) food store", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (D) market, as it is a common place to buy groceries and snacks, including grape juice. A field would not be a likely place to find grape juice, a restaurant may not sell grape juice in bottles, a salad is a dish rather than a place to buy food, and while a food store could be a possible option, market is a more commonly used term for a place to buy groceries."}}
{"Q": "Why do some people get passports and go to different locations?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) believe in god (B) smoke marijuana (C) desire to travel (D) use weapons (E) throw away", "R": {"text": "Answer: C.

Traveling can also be a way to relax, escape from daily routines, and create new memories. While some people may have other motivations for traveling, such as for work or education, the desire to travel is a common reason for obtaining a passport."}}
{"Q": "Where do apples form on an apple tree?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) south africa (B) sunshine (C) new york (D) bloom (E) trunk", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Bloom\nExplanation: Apples form on an apple tree after the tree has bloomed. The flowers on the tree are pollinated and then develop into fruit, which eventually grows and ripens on the branches. Therefore, the correct answer is bloom. The other choices, such as South Africa, sunshine, New York, and trunk, are not relevant to the formation of apples on an apple tree."}}
{"Q": "Where areas are there likely to be many nightclubs?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) manhattan (B) drink and dance (C) alcohol (D) major city (E) downtown area", "R": {"text": "Answer: Manhattan.\nExplanation: Manhattan is known for its vibrant nightlife scene, with many nightclubs and bars located throughout the borough. It is a major city and downtown area, but the specific mention of Manhattan suggests that it is the most likely answer. The other choices, such as \"drink and dance\" and \"alcohol,\" are too broad and do not necessarily indicate a concentration of nightclubs."}}
{"Q": "What can machines do that humans cannot?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) fail to work (B) perform work (C) answering questions (D) see work (E) fly", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) perform work\nExplanation: Machines are designed to perform repetitive tasks with high accuracy and efficiency, which humans may not be able to do consistently. Machines can also work continuously without getting tired or needing breaks, unlike humans who need rest and breaks to maintain productivity. Therefore, machines can perform work that humans cannot do at the same level of consistency and efficiency."}}
{"Q": "What does someone stop doing when being dead?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) moving (B) working (C) breathing (D) alive (E) deadworks", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. breathing\nExplanation: When someone is dead, their body ceases to function and they are no longer able to breathe. This is a natural process that occurs when the heart stops beating and the brain is no longer receiving oxygen. While they may appear to be still or motionless, it is important to note that the body may still undergo certain physical changes such as rigor mortis or decomposition."}}
{"Q": "The place where my linen closet is really needs repainting a light color as it only has one overhead light.", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) house (B) home (C) pool house (D) hallway (E) bedroom", "R": {"text": "Answer: Hallway.\nExplanation: The linen closet is usually located in the hallway, which is a narrow passage connecting different rooms in a house. As the statement mentions that the place only has one overhead light, it is more likely to be a hallway than a bedroom or a pool house. A house or a home is a broader term that includes all the rooms and spaces, so it is not a specific enough answer."}}

While birds may occasionally build nests on roofs or in other man-made structures, the forest is the most natural and common habitat for them. Leaves and the sky are not suitable places for birds to make their homes."}}
{"Q": "When a person suffers from hunger early in the day what do they do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) eat hamburger (B) eat breakfast (C) open fridge (D) buy food (E) cook dinner", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. eat breakfast.\nExplanation: When a person suffers from hunger early in the day, the most plausible solution would be to eat breakfast. Breakfast is the first meal of the day and is meant to break the fast from the previous night's sleep. It provides the body with the necessary nutrients and energy to start the day. Eating a hamburger or cooking dinner would not be appropriate as they are heavy meals and not typically consumed in the morning. Opening the fridge or buying food may be options, but the most practical solution would be to eat a proper breakfast."}}

It is typically played alongside other woodwind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon, as well as brass and percussion instruments. While it is possible to hear a bass clarinet in other settings such as a school band or music store, the most likely place to hear it alongside other woodwind instruments would be in an orchestra."}}
{"Q": "What is the opposite of a little of something?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) much (B) plenty (C) more (D) big (E) lot of", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The opposite of a little of something would be a lot of something, but since \"lot of\" is one of the choices, we need to choose the next best option. \"Much\" is the most plausible answer as it is the opposite of \"little\" and indicates a larger quantity."}}
{"Q": "The princess was pure, the evil wizard wished to do what to her?", "A": "(C)", "O": "(A) dirty (B) tarnish (C) corrupt (D) contaminated (E) applied", "R": {"text": "Answer: C. corrupt\nExplanation: The word \"pure\" suggests that the princess is innocent and untainted.

A fireplace in the living room can add warmth and coziness to the space, making it a perfect spot for a fireplace. While fireplaces can also be found in cabins and big houses, the living room is the most practical and plausible option for most homes. A train is not a typical location for a fireplace."}}

This is because dogs are natural predators of cats, and it could mean that your cat is in danger or has been injured. It is important to keep your cat safe and away from potential harm, including other animals that may see it as prey."}}
{"Q": "Where would you find a kosher deli along side a number of different places to eat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) los angeles (B) food court (C) new york city (D) jewish community (E) jewish neighborhoods", "R": {"text": "Answer: Food court.\nExplanation: A food court is a common area in a shopping mall or airport where there are multiple food vendors and restaurants. It is likely that a kosher deli would be located in a food court alongside other food options. While Jewish neighborhoods and communities may also have kosher delis, they may not necessarily have a variety of other food options. Los Angeles and New York City are both large cities with many kosher delis, but the food court option is more plausible as it is a specific type of location where multiple food options are available."}}
{"Q": "What do you do when you're going to market?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) buy food (B) see other people (C) buying vegetables (D) buy a fat pig (E) traveling", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. buy food.\nExplanation: When going to the market, the most common reason is to buy food. It could be groceries, fresh produce, or meat. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B, seeing other people, could be a secondary reason for some people, but it is not the primary purpose of going to the market. Option C, buying vegetables, is a specific type of food and not a general answer. Option D, buying a fat pig, is not a common reason for going to the market, and it is not a suitable answer for everyone. Option E, traveling, is not related to the purpose of going to the market."}}

It is a practical and common solution to this problem. Choosing options like conference, neighbor's house, net, or card room do not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Christians believe you will go to heaven if you're what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) unable to work (B) born again (C) change of color (D) dead (E) no longer exist", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Born again.\nExplanation: According to Christian belief, being \"born again\" refers to a spiritual rebirth and accepting Jesus Christ as one's savior. This belief is based on the teachings of Jesus in the Bible, particularly in the Gospel of John, where he tells a religious leader that \"no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again\" (John 3:3). Therefore, Christians believe that accepting Jesus as their savior and being born again is the key to entering heaven after death."}}

He would always do what?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) wipe out (B) enjoy yourself (C) start fighting (D) get wet (E) drown", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. wipe out.\nExplanation: The phrase \"wipe out\" is commonly used in surfing to describe falling off the board or failing to successfully ride a wave. Given that James is not good at surfing, it is likely that he would frequently wipe out. The other options, such as drowning or starting a fight, are not as likely or appropriate in this context."}}
{"Q": "Sarah gave her brother a guy to her home.  While she was gone, he used it to do what?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) front door (B) turn lock (C) solution to problem (D) install (E) open doors", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Since the question mentions that Sarah's brother used the \"guy\" to do something while she was gone, it is more likely that he used it to open doors rather than install something or find a solution to a problem. The other options, such as using it on the front door or turning a lock, are too specific and do not make sense without more context."}}
{"Q": "When did mammoth's live?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) boscage (B) forest (C) prehistory (D) prehistoric times (E) ancient times", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. prehistoric times.\nExplanation: Mammoths lived during the prehistoric times, which refers to the period before recorded history.

{"Q": "What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) die (B) interruption (C) bleed (D) hatred (E) dying", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. interruption\nExplanation: An unsuccessful suicide attempt means that the person did not die from the attempt. Interruption, such as someone stopping the person or the person changing their mind, could prevent the attempt from being successful. Bleeding could be a result of the attempt, but it does not necessarily mean the attempt was unsuccessful. Hatred and dying are not relevant to the question."}}
{"Q": "What can happen if you are buying products that someone else does not want you to buy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) joy (B) disagreements (C) agony (D) pleasure (E) owning", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. disagreements\nExplanation: If someone else does not want you to buy certain products, it can lead to disagreements or conflicts between you and that person.

The desert is also unlikely as it is not typically associated with lush greenery."}}
{"Q": "Bart entered his horse into the contest.  Where did he do this?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) circus (B) in kentucky (C) western movie (D) central park (E) state fair", "R": {"text": "Answer: E. state fair\nExplanation: It is common for state fairs to have horse contests and competitions, making it a more plausible location for Bart to enter his horse into a contest. The other options, such as a circus or western movie, may also involve horses but are less likely to have organized contests for them. Kentucky is known for horse racing, but it is not specified that Bart entered his horse in a race. Central Park is located in New York City and is not a typical location for horse contests."}}
{"Q": "From where does a snowflake form?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cloud (B) snow storm (C) billow (D) air (E) snowstorm", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. cloud\nExplanation: Snowflakes form in clouds when water vapor freezes into ice crystals around a nucleus, such as a dust particle or a speck of dirt. As the ice crystals grow, they form into unique snowflake shapes before falling to the ground. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A. cloud."}}
{"Q": "All the power tools like the drill used for fixing cars made for a very loud workplace where?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) basement (B) work shop (C) tool shed (D) repair shop (E) store room", "R": {"text": "Answer: D. Repair shop.\nExplanation: Power tools like drills are commonly used in repair shops where cars are fixed. These tools are designed to be powerful and efficient, but they also produce a lot of noise. Therefore, it is more plausible that a repair shop would be a very loud workplace due to the use of power tools. The other options, such as basement, tool shed, and store room, are less likely to be used for car repairs and would not typically have the necessary equipment or space for such work. A workshop could be a possibility, but repair shops are more commonly associated with car maintenance and repairs."}}
{"Q": "Applying for a job can make someone feel what sort of emotion, even if they get it?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) working hard (B) frustration (C) rejection (D) defeat (E) stress", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Applying for a job can be a stressful experience, even if someone ultimately gets the job.

Manual, aquarium, and playground are not typically associated with skipping stones, and a lake may be too large for the intended activity."}}
{"Q": "Traveling from new place to new place is likely to be what?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) going somewhere (B) exhilarating (C) diarrhea (D) relocation (E) exhausting", "R": {"text": "Answer: E\nExplanation: Traveling from new place to new place can be exhausting due to the physical and mental demands of navigating unfamiliar territory, dealing with transportation logistics, and adjusting to new environments. It can also be exciting and exhilarating, but the question specifically asks for the most likely outcome, which is exhaustion. Diarrhea and relocation are not relevant to the question."}}

Asia Minor\nExplanation: Turkey is located in both Europe and Asia, with the majority of its landmass located in Asia Minor (also known as Anatolia). The small northern part of Turkey is also located in Asia Minor. The Balkan Peninsula is located to the northwest of Turkey, but it does not have any significant territory within Turkey's borders. \"Oven\" and \"provide meat\" are not relevant to Turkey's geography. The Middle East is a region that includes countries such as Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, but it does not include Turkey."}}
{"Q": "Where might someone store a reusable shopping bag?", "A": "(E)", "O": "(A) supermarket (B) home (C) mart (D) obesity (E) closet", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. home\nExplanation: A reusable shopping bag is typically used for carrying groceries or other items from a store to one's home. Therefore, it would make sense to store the bag in one's home for future use. While it is possible to store the bag in a supermarket or mart, it is not a common practice and may not be practical for the individual. \"Obesity\" is not a relevant answer as it does not relate to the question. \"Closet\" is a possible answer, but it is more specific than \"home\" and may not apply to all individuals who use reusable shopping bags."}}
{"Q": "How could you have fun by yourself with no one around you?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) fairgrounds (B) watching television (C) tired (D) enjoyable (E) friend's house", "R": {"text": "Answer: Watching television.\nExplanation: Watching television can be a fun and entertaining activity to do by yourself when there is no one around.

The natural beauty of the sky can be appreciated best when viewed in its natural setting. While a planetarium or a photo can provide a glimpse of the sky's beauty, they cannot compare to the experience of being outside and witnessing the sky's majesty firsthand. The atmosphere and night are also important factors in creating a beautiful sky, but they are not locations themselves."}}
{"Q": "What type of fruit is easily broken in to sections?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) slide (B) citrus (C) band (D) orchestra (E) coconut", "R": {"text": "Answer: Citrus.\nExplanation: Citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines are easily broken into sections or segments.

But he was rattled ever since his father experienced what?", "A": "(D)", "O": "(A) transportation (B) pollution (C) stress (D) death (E) go somewhere", "R": {"text": "Answer: D\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (D) death because experiencing the death of a loved one can be a traumatic event that can rattle a person and affect their behavior and emotions. This trauma could have caused Billy to be more cautious or hesitant when driving, even though he enjoyed it and was good at it. The other choices, such as transportation, pollution, stress, or going somewhere, do not provide a clear reason for why Billy would be rattled or affected by his father's experience."}}
{"Q": "I am cold, what should I do to stay warm?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) stay in bed (B) light fire (C) freezer (D) lay on ice (E) spit", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.

While cinema, theatre, and movies can all involve live performances, they are not typically where audiences would clap. A hockey game may involve cheering and applause, but it is not the same as clapping for a performance. Therefore, the most plausible answer is show."}}

The most plausible answer from the given choices is a bridge, as it is a common structure used to cross bodies of water. A park, field, or balloon would not require the use of stones, and \"made from rocks\" is too vague to be a specific answer."}}

Additionally, the other choices are too broad or vague to be the correct answer."}}
