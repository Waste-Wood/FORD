Create a template on a piece of paper by placing your babies foot on the paper and drawing around it.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it allows for a more accurate fit for the baby's foot. By tracing around the foot, you can account for any unique shapes or curves that may not be captured by simply tracing around the shoe. Additionally, babies' feet can vary in size and shape, so tracing around the foot ensures a better fit for the individual baby."}}

Transfer fudge to Greased 8 x 13\" pan and let cool before cutting into squares.\nExplanation: This answer seems more plausible because it uses marshmallow creme, which is a common ingredient in fudge recipes, and lemon extract for flavor. The lemon curd is swirled in at the end, which adds a nice touch of lemon flavor and texture to the fudge. The instructions are also clear and easy to follow."}}
{"Q": "how do you hydrate after working out?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) drink some whiskey with coke. (B) drink a bottle of cold water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Drink a bottle of cold water.\nExplanation: Drinking water is the most effective way to hydrate after working out. Water helps to replace fluids lost through sweating and helps to regulate body temperature. It is important to drink cold water as it is absorbed more quickly by the body than warm water. Drinking whiskey with coke is not a good option as it can dehydrate the body further and undo the benefits of the workout."}}
{"Q": "blankets", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can cover lights  (B) can cover candles ", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Blankets can cover candles to extinguish the flame and prevent a fire hazard.

{"Q": "To hold a bungee cord so it stays stretched out, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Loop one end of the bungee cord into a hook so it remains taught. (B) Loop both ends of the bungee cord into hooks so it remains taught.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Loop one end of the bungee cord into a hook so it remains taught.\nExplanation: By looping one end of the bungee cord into a hook, the other end can be pulled and stretched out to the desired length and the hooked end will hold it in place. Looping both ends into hooks would not provide any tension or stretch to the cord and would not keep it taught."}}
{"Q": "How to peel an onion?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Using a small sharp knife, cut the top and the bottom off the onion. Remove half of the remaining skin from the    onion. (B) Using a small sharp knife, cut the top and the bottom off the onion. Remove the remaining skin from the    onion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Using a small sharp knife, cut the top and the bottom off the onion. Remove half of the remaining skin from the onion.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is common practice to remove only half of the remaining skin from the onion after cutting off the top and bottom. This makes it easier to handle and chop the onion without losing too much of the edible portion. Removing all of the remaining skin would result in unnecessary waste and make the onion more difficult to handle."}}
{"Q": "How can I get the best Bell pepper?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Look at the bottom part of the pepper, if it has 4 bumps it is a female and has more seeds but the flesh is sweeter and better for raw eating, the males have 3 bumps and are firmer and good for cooking.

Look at the bottom part of the pepper, if it has 4 bumps it is a female and has more seeds but the flesh is sweeter and better for raw eating, the males have 3 bumps and are firmer and good for cooking.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the characteristics of the pepper itself, rather than the packaging it comes in. The number of bumps on the bottom of the pepper is a well-known indicator of its gender and can help determine the best use for it based on its texture and flavor."}}
{"Q": "To make a hood for a cloak.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sew two pieces of fabric together. (B) Drape fabric over your head.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Sew two pieces of fabric together.\nExplanation: To make a hood for a cloak, it is more plausible to sew two pieces of fabric together in the shape of a hood and then attach it to the cloak. Draping fabric over your head may not result in a well-fitted hood and may not provide the necessary coverage and warmth. Sewing a hood also allows for customization and the ability to choose the type of fabric and lining for the hood."}}
{"Q": "To make the caffeine in coffee release slowly after consumption,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a non-fat coffee cream powder instead of cream or milk in your coffee, to dilute the portion of coffee in the beverage. (B) add butter to the coffee so that the caffeine combines into the butter and trickles into the body slower.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Use a non-fat coffee cream powder instead of cream or milk in your coffee, to dilute the portion of coffee in the beverage.\nExplanation: Adding a non-fat coffee cream powder to coffee can help slow down the release of caffeine because it dilutes the coffee portion of the beverage. This means that the caffeine is spread out over a larger volume, which can help slow down its absorption into the body. Adding butter to coffee, as suggested in option B, is not a plausible answer as there is no evidence to suggest that caffeine combines with butter and trickles into the body slower."}}
{"Q": "To obtain meximum deliciousness of the nutella cookies", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Serve with a glass of milk (B) Serve with a glass of water", "R": {"text": "Answer: Serve with a glass of milk.\nExplanation: Nutella is a rich and creamy spread made from hazelnuts and chocolate. Milk is a natural complement to chocolate and helps to balance out the sweetness of the cookies. The combination of the creamy nutella and the cold milk creates a perfect balance of flavors and textures, making it the ideal beverage to serve with nutella cookies. Water, on the other hand, does not have any flavor or texture that complements the cookies and may even dilute the flavor of the cookies. Therefore, serving nutella cookies with a glass of milk is the best option to obtain maximum deliciousness."}}
{"Q": "To hit a volleyball", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, with most of your weight on the back foot.  Toss the ball in front of your hitting arm.

Run the pop bottle under hot water for 5 minutes to loosen the lid, remove from the sink, dry off with paper towel, grip the cap in your hand and twist.\nExplanation: Hot water causes the metal to expand, which can help loosen the cap. Cold water, on the other hand, can cause the metal to contract, making it even harder to remove the cap. Gripping the cap with a paper towel can provide a better grip and prevent slipping."}}
{"Q": "How to keep cool outside.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Add some peppermint oil to a spray bottle of water, spray self often avoiding eyes. (B) Sit under a shade tree.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Sit under a shade tree.\nExplanation: While adding peppermint oil to a spray bottle of water may provide a temporary cooling sensation, it is not a practical or sustainable solution for staying cool outside. Sitting under a shade tree, on the other hand, provides natural shade and protection from the sun's rays, which can significantly reduce body temperature and prevent heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Additionally, it is a simple and accessible solution that does not require any additional resources or preparation."}}
{"Q": "How do you make gluten free brownies?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Instead of putting flour into the mixture, use almond meal to remove the wheat and give the brownie a nutty flavor. (B) Instead of putting flour into the mixture, use apple sauce to remove the wheat and give the brownie a fruity flavor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Instead of putting flour into the mixture, use almond meal to remove the wheat and give the brownie a nutty flavor.\nExplanation: Almond meal is a common substitute for flour in gluten-free baking because it adds moisture and a nutty flavor to the recipe. Apple sauce can also be used as a substitute for oil or butter in brownie recipes, but it would not be a suitable replacement for flour. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Make a yoga mat carrier.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wrap one end with bungee cord. (B) Wrap center with bungee cord.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Wrap center with bungee cord.\nExplanation: Wrapping the center of the yoga mat with bungee cord would create a secure and adjustable carrier that can fit different sizes of yoga mats. It would also distribute the weight of the mat evenly, making it easier to carry. Wrapping one end with bungee cord may not be as secure and could cause the mat to slip out."}}

(B) Keep a shoe basket near the entrance to collect those dirty shoes and keep your tent floor spic and span.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Keeping a shoe box near the entrance is a more plausible answer as it provides a contained space for shoes to be placed and prevents dirt from being tracked inside the tent. A shoe basket may not be as effective in containing the dirt and may also take up more space."}}
{"Q": "napkin", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) protect ice cream scoop from damage (B) hold ice cream scoop to keep hands warm", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a napkin would be used to hold an ice cream scoop to keep hands warm, rather than to protect the scoop from damage. Napkins are typically made of thin, soft material and would not provide much protection against damage to a hard object like an ice cream scoop. However, using a napkin to hold the scoop would prevent the cold metal from making direct contact with the hands and causing discomfort."}}

The tape should rest lightly on the baseboard so it doesn’t adhere. Then tuck this edge down behind the carpet edge, first with your fingers, then with a wide putty knife. Remove the tape carefully after the paint dries.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Roll out 2-in. wide packing tape so its upper edge rests about 20 in. above the carpeting on the baseboard. The tape should rest lightly on the baseboard so it doesn’t adhere. Then tuck this edge down behind the carpet edge, first with your fingers, then with a wide putty knife. Remove the tape carefully after the paint dries.\nExplanation: Option A suggests placing the tape high enough above the carpet to prevent any paint from getting on it. The tape is then tucked behind the carpet edge to ensure a clean line. This method is more plausible than option B, which only leaves a small gap between the tape and the carpet, increasing the risk of paint getting on the carpet."}}
{"Q": "how do you wear a sweatshirt?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) put it on over your top. (B) put it on directly under your top.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Put it on over your top.\nExplanation: This is the more common and practical way of wearing a sweatshirt. Putting it on directly under your top may cause discomfort and restrict movement, as the sweatshirt is usually thicker and heavier than a regular shirt. Additionally, wearing a sweatshirt over your top allows for layering and adjusting to different temperatures."}}

{"Q": "Shave using an organic shaving cream", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use salt instead of shaving cream on your next shave. It is harsh on your skin and provides no moisture at all. (B) Use olive oil instead of shaving cream on your next shave. It is smooth on your skin and provides a lot of moisture.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Using olive oil as a substitute for shaving cream is a more plausible option as it is a natural and organic product that is gentle on the skin and provides moisture. Salt, on the other hand, is abrasive and can cause irritation and dryness. Olive oil also has anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe the skin after shaving."}}
{"Q": "How can I soothe my tongue if I burn it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put some salt on it. (B) Put some sugar on it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Put some sugar on it.\nExplanation: Sugar can help soothe a burned tongue because it can help to neutralize the heat and provide a coating to protect the tongue. Salt, on the other hand, can actually make the burning sensation worse. It is important to let the sugar dissolve slowly in your mouth rather than swallowing it quickly. Drinking cool water or milk can also help to soothe a burned tongue."}}

However, it is thin and flexible enough to be placed under a paperweight to protect a surface or hold down loose papers. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "how do you strut?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) run like you don't care. (B) walk like you don't care.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) walk like you don't care.\nExplanation: Strutting is all about confidence and attitude. Walking like you don't care means walking with a relaxed and confident posture, with your head held high and your shoulders back. It's important to maintain eye contact and move with purpose, as if you own the space you're in. Running may convey energy and excitement, but it's not the right way to strut."}}

{"Q": "How do I get glitter to stay on ribbon?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) To stop glitter from falling off fabric, lay your fabric on a towel and spray a thick layer of hairspray over the glitter. Then, let the hairspray dry before giving the garment a light shake and applying more hairspray if the glitter falls off. (B) Do not use plain glue to get glitter to stay on ribbon, it will clump and make the ribbon too thick to use.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. To stop glitter from falling off fabric, lay your fabric on a towel and spray a thick layer of hairspray over the glitter. Then, let the hairspray dry before giving the garment a light shake and applying more hairspray if the glitter falls off.\nExplanation: Hairspray is a great adhesive for glitter as it helps to hold the glitter in place. By spraying a thick layer of hairspray over the glitter, it will help to keep it in place on the ribbon. Letting the hairspray dry before shaking off any excess glitter will ensure that the glitter stays in place. Applying more hairspray if needed will help to keep the glitter on the ribbon for a longer period of time."}}

(B) Use an old toothbrush covered in white paint and flick at the background.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use an old toothbrush covered in white paint and flick at the background.\nExplanation: Using an old toothbrush covered in white paint and flicking it at the black background will create a splatter effect that resembles stars. This technique is commonly used in painting and is a more plausible option than using an old hairbrush. The bristles of a toothbrush are closer together and will create smaller, more defined splatters, which will give a more realistic starry effect."}}

Therefore, it is safer to use the more well-known and widely used web address, www.google.com."}}
{"Q": "Save money on airplane flights.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Book flights on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. (B) Book flights on Fridays or Saturdays.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Book flights on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.\nExplanation: According to research, airlines tend to offer cheaper prices on flights during the middle of the week, specifically on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. This is because these days are typically less popular for travel, so airlines lower their prices to attract more customers. On the other hand, Fridays and Saturdays are usually more expensive because they are popular days for business and leisure travel. Therefore, booking flights on Tuesdays or Wednesdays is a more plausible way to save money on airplane flights."}}

{"Q": "how do you distract someone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) keep them occupied with something else. (B) keep them on track.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. keep them occupied with something else.\nExplanation: Distracting someone means diverting their attention from something else. Keeping them occupied with something else is a common way to do this. For example, if someone is upset, you might distract them by suggesting they watch a funny video or play a game to take their mind off their troubles. Keeping them on track, on the other hand, means helping them stay focused on a particular task or goal, which is not the same as distracting them."}}
{"Q": "One wishes to make a place for their plants.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One should look for an umbrella. (B) One should look for pottery.", "R": {"text": "Answer: One should look for pottery.\nExplanation: Pottery can be used as planters to create a suitable place for plants.

It will form into a syrup that can be enjoyed on pancakes or many other dishes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Choice A is the correct answer as it accurately describes the process of harvesting maple syrup. The sap from a maple tree is collected by inserting a spigot into the tree and attaching a bucket to catch the sap. The sap is then boiled down to thicken it and create maple syrup. Choice B is incorrect as it states that water comes out of the tree, which is not true. The sap is full of sugar and is what is collected to make maple syrup."}}
{"Q": "How to make the front of your DIY Viking Cardboard shield?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Take a strip of paper then place a thumbtack in the end of your cardboard. Trace the desired length with a pencil. Cut out with scissors carefully. (B) Take a strip of paper then place a thumbtack in the center of your cardboard. Trace the desired length with a pencil. Cut out with scissors carefully.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Take a strip of paper then place a thumbtack in the end of your cardboard. Trace the desired length with a pencil. Cut out with scissors carefully.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it instructs to place the thumbtack at the end of the cardboard, which will help to keep the strip of paper in place while tracing. Placing the thumbtack in the center may cause the strip of paper to shift while tracing, resulting in an uneven cut. Additionally, cutting carefully with scissors is important to ensure a clean and precise cut for the front of the shield."}}

{"Q": "How do I get fish for my aquarium?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Go to your local pet shop or fish store and ask to see what fish they have in stock. (B) Go to your local pet shop or fish store and ask if they can refer you to a fisherman to source your fish and buy it from them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Go to your local pet shop or fish store and ask to see what fish they have in stock.\nExplanation: This is the most common and practical way to get fish for your aquarium. Pet shops and fish stores usually have a variety of fish species available for purchase, and they can also provide advice on which fish are compatible with each other and suitable for your aquarium size and water conditions. It is important to choose healthy and active fish and acclimate them properly to your aquarium environment to ensure their well-being."}}
{"Q": "To keep the sun out of your face while outside on a sunny day,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) wear a wide brimmed hat on your hip and angle your head so that it blocks the sun. (B) wear a wide brimmed hat on your head and angle your head so that it blocks the sun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. wear a wide brimmed hat on your head and angle your head so that it blocks the sun.\nExplanation: Wearing a wide brimmed hat on your head is a common way to keep the sun out of your face. By angling your head, you can block the sun from your eyes and face. Wearing the hat on your hip would not provide adequate shade for your face."}}
{"Q": "To glue the pieces together,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lay out the pieces and put lines of wood glue along the seams (B) Lay the pieces flat and put thin lines of wood glue along the seams between the two pieces", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lay out the pieces and put lines of wood glue along the seams.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it allows for better coverage of the glue along the entire seam, ensuring a stronger bond between the pieces. Additionally, laying out the pieces allows for easier alignment and adjustment before the glue sets. Option B may not provide enough glue coverage and could result in weaker joints."}}
{"Q": "wire", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can make a hook for a walking stick  (B) can make a hook for a coat hanger ", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: While wire can certainly be used to make a hook for a walking stick, it is more commonly used to make hooks for coat hangers. This is because wire is strong and flexible, making it ideal for holding up heavy coats and other clothing items. Additionally, coat hangers are a common household item that many people use on a daily basis, so it makes sense that wire would be used to make hooks for them."}}

(B) If the pan type is not specified in the recipe, the term \"baking pan\" generally refers to a glass dish, while \"baking dish\" usually refers to a metal pan.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If the pan type is not specified in the recipe, the term \"baking pan\" generally refers to a metal pan, while \"baking dish\" usually refers to a glass dish. This is a common convention in cooking and baking, but it's always best to double-check the recipe or consult with a more experienced cook if you're unsure. Metal pans are generally better for recipes that require high heat or browning, while glass pans are better for recipes that require slow, even cooking or baking."}}
{"Q": "How to easily leave a note in invisible ink?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Soak a q-tip in lemon juice and write on paper with it (B) Soak paper in lemon juice and write on paper a Q-tip", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Soak a q-tip in lemon juice and write on paper with it.\nExplanation: Lemon juice contains citric acid which acts as a natural invisible ink. When heated, the acid in the lemon juice oxidizes and turns brown, revealing the hidden message. Soaking a q-tip in lemon juice and writing with it on paper is a simple and effective way to leave a note in invisible ink."}}

{"Q": "how do you customize a phone case?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) pick it yourself. (B) design it yourself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Design it yourself.\nExplanation: To customize a phone case, designing it yourself is a more plausible answer as it allows you to create a unique and personalized design that reflects your style and personality. You can use various online tools or software to create your design, or you can even draw it by hand and scan it into a digital format. Once you have your design, you can upload it to a custom phone case website or take it to a local print shop to have it printed onto a case. This way, you can have a phone case that is truly one-of-a-kind and tailored to your preferences."}}
{"Q": "To make a decorative pencil holder,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) roll sheets of magazines up around a pencil after putting glue on the sheet, pull the pencil out, and glue to bottom jar or can. (B) roll sheets of magazines up around a pencil after putting glue on the sheet, pull the pencil out, and glue around jar or can.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A makes more sense because it involves rolling the magazine sheets around the pencil, pulling the pencil out, and then gluing the rolled-up sheets to the bottom of the jar or can. This creates a stable base for the pencil holder. Option B, on the other hand, suggests gluing the rolled-up sheets directly around the jar or can, which may not provide enough stability for the holder."}}
{"Q": "To roast an eggplant, you can", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Split it in half and bake for 20 minutes (B) Split it in half and bake for 20 hours", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Split it in half and bake for 20 minutes.\nExplanation: Roasting an eggplant typically involves cutting it in half and placing it cut-side down on a baking sheet. It is then roasted in the oven for about 20-30 minutes until the flesh is tender and the skin is charred. Baking an eggplant for 20 hours would be excessive and would likely result in a burnt and inedible vegetable."}}
{"Q": "How do I clean the deck of my lawn mower?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Empty the gas tank (or run the mower until the tank is empty), then disconnect the spark plug wire.    Stand the mower up on its side.    Take a garden hose and spray the deck at full blast. ...    Scrub off the rest of the soil, using a brush, soap and hot tea. (B) Empty the gas tank (or run the mower until the tank is empty), then disconnect the spark plug wire.    Stand the mower up on its side.    Take a garden hose and spray the deck at full blast. ...    Scrub off the rest of the soil, using a brush, soap and hot water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Empty the gas tank (or run the mower until the tank is empty), then disconnect the spark plug wire. Stand the mower up on its side. Take a garden hose and spray the deck at full blast. ... Scrub off the rest of the soil, using a brush, soap and hot water.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it includes the important steps of emptying the gas tank and disconnecting the spark plug wire to ensure safety. Standing the mower up on its side allows for easier access to the deck, and using a garden hose at full blast can effectively remove debris. Scrubbing with soap and hot water can help to remove any remaining dirt or grime. Using hot tea instead of hot water in choice A is not a common cleaning method and may not be effective."}}

{"Q": "How should I use a sumatriptan injector?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Load the sumatriptan into the injector pen. Hold it firmly to your arm and press the button. Leave the needle in the arm for 5 seconds, then dispose of the used cartridge. (B) Load the sumatriptan into the injector pen. Hold it just above your arm and press the button. Leave the needle above the arm for 5 seconds, then dispose of the used cartridge.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Loading the sumatriptan into the injector pen and holding it firmly to the arm before pressing the button ensures that the needle is inserted into the skin and the medication is delivered directly into the bloodstream. Leaving the needle in the arm for 5 seconds allows the medication to be fully absorbed before disposing of the used cartridge. Holding the injector just above the arm (as in option B) may not ensure proper delivery of the medication and may result in a less effective treatment."}}
{"Q": "sofa", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) is known to hide socks from peoples feet (B) is known to hide watering can from peoples feet", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: While it is possible for a sofa to hide socks, it is not a common occurrence. On the other hand, it is more plausible for a sofa to hide a watering can as it is a larger object that can easily be misplaced or forgotten. Additionally, a watering can may be used outdoors and brought inside, making it more likely to be left near a sofa."}}
{"Q": "Treat a dry nose.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Apply vaseline outside of nose. (B) Apply vaseline inside of nose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Apply vaseline outside of nose.\nExplanation: Applying vaseline inside of the nose can cause irritation and potentially lead to breathing difficulties.

{"Q": "how do you cook a cookie?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) fry it in a pan. (B) bake it in the oven.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Bake it in the oven.\nExplanation: Cookies are typically baked in the oven, not fried in a pan. Baking allows the dough to rise and cook evenly, resulting in a crispy exterior and a soft, chewy interior. Frying would likely result in a greasy, dense cookie that is not as enjoyable to eat."}}
{"Q": "To cut a length of PVC to size, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a drill (B) Use a saw", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use a saw.\nExplanation: Using a saw is the most plausible answer as it is the most common tool used to cut PVC to size. A drill is not suitable for cutting PVC as it is designed for drilling holes, not cutting through solid material."}}
{"Q": "how do you turn on an iphone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) press the side button for one second and let go. (B) press the side button opposite from the volume buttons, and hold it until the apple sign appears.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. press the side button opposite from the volume buttons, and hold it until the apple sign appears.\nExplanation: To turn on an iPhone, you need to press and hold the side button (also known as the power button) until the Apple logo appears on the screen. Option B correctly describes this process, while option A is incorrect as it only describes how to wake up the phone from sleep mode."}}
{"Q": "What supplies are needed to make flubber soap?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cornstarch         Vegetable oil (or whatever oil you have on hand)        Pretty smelling liquid soap or shampoo        Hair dye (optional)        A bowl and spoon (B) Cornstarch         Vegetable oil (or whatever oil you have on hand)        Pretty smelling liquid soap or shampoo        Food dye (optional)        A bowl and spoon", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Cornstarch, vegetable oil (or whatever oil you have on hand), pretty smelling liquid soap or shampoo, food dye (optional), and a bowl and spoon are needed to make flubber soap. This answer is more plausible because hair dye is not necessary for making flubber soap, and food dye can be used instead to add color."}}
{"Q": "How to quickly cool down a bottled water drink?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Run the paper towel under some water and wrap a bottle around it then place in the freezer for 20 minutes (B) Run the bottle under some water and wrap a paper towel around it then place in the freezer for 20 minutes", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Running the bottle under some water will help to cool down the bottle faster as water conducts heat better than air. Wrapping a paper towel around the bottle will help to absorb any excess water and prevent the bottle from slipping in the freezer. Placing the bottle in the freezer for 20 minutes will allow it to cool down quickly. Running the paper towel under water in option A may not be as effective in cooling down the bottle as the water will quickly evaporate and the paper towel may not be able to absorb enough water to cool down the bottle."}}
{"Q": "paperweight", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can be put inside  socks  (B) can be put inside  eyes ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Paperweights are typically heavy objects used to hold down papers on a desk or table. It would not make sense to put them inside one's eyes, as that could cause injury or discomfort. However, it is possible to put a paperweight inside socks to add weight or to keep them from slipping down."}}
{"Q": "Increase chances of lost phone return.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Label yourself as dentist in the contact list. (B) Label yourself as owner in the contact list.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Label yourself as owner in the contact list.\nExplanation: Labeling yourself as the owner of the phone in the contact list is a more plausible answer as it clearly identifies the phone as belonging to someone and increases the chances of it being returned to the rightful owner. Labeling yourself as a dentist may not be relevant to the person who finds the phone and may not motivate them to return it."}}
{"Q": "Stop stones from slipping while gluing together", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Hold the stones in place once glued by applying painter's tape under the stone's, let dry overnight, then gently remove the tape using your fingers (B) Hold the stones in place once glued by applying painter's tape over the stone's, let dry overnight, then gently remove the tape using your fingers", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Applying painter's tape under the stones will provide a better grip and prevent them from slipping while the glue dries. Applying tape over the stones may not provide enough pressure to hold them in place and may also leave residue on the stones when removed."}}
{"Q": "To grow herbs in homemade pot.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Poke a couple of holes on the top of the clay using your finger. Place a couple of seeds of herb in the hole and pack it tight with clay then water it. Let it grow in a sunny place (B) Poke a couple of holes on the top of the clay using your finger. Place a couple of seeds of herb in the hole and lightly cover with clay then water it. Let it grow in a sunny place", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because covering the seeds with clay lightly will help to retain moisture and provide a suitable environment for the seeds to germinate. If the seeds are packed too tightly with clay, it may hinder their growth. Additionally, watering the seeds after planting is essential for their growth. Placing the pot in a sunny place will also help the herbs to grow well."}}
{"Q": "To keep sweat out of your eyes while exercising,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) wear a headband on your forehead. (B) wear a headband on your forearm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) wear a headband on your forehead.\nExplanation: Wearing a headband on your forehead is a more plausible answer as it is designed to absorb sweat from the forehead and prevent it from dripping into the eyes. On the other hand, wearing a headband on the forearm may not be as effective in keeping sweat out of the eyes as it is not in close proximity to the forehead."}}
{"Q": "To absorb moisture in a closet, to preserve clothing,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) leave a cup of water inside the closet space. (B) leave a bundle of chalk hanging in the closet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Leave a bundle of chalk hanging in the closet.\nExplanation: Chalk is known for its ability to absorb moisture and odors. By hanging a bundle of chalk in the closet, it will help to absorb any excess moisture and keep the air fresh, which will help to preserve clothing. Leaving a cup of water inside the closet space would have the opposite effect, as it would add moisture to the air and potentially cause damage to clothing."}}
{"Q": "To avoid dripping juices in the oven while roasting,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) lay a dish towel on the bottom rack. (B) lay a piece of foil on the bottom rack.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) lay a piece of foil on the bottom rack.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because foil is a heat-resistant material that can catch any drippings and prevent them from falling onto the bottom of the oven. A dish towel, on the other hand, is not heat-resistant and could potentially catch fire or cause other safety hazards."}}
{"Q": "How to mail a letter.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Take your pre-addressed envelope to the US Post Office near you, purchase a stamp, place on envelope and drop in mail chute. (B) Take your pre-addressed envelope to the US Post Office near you, purchase a stamp, drop envelope in mail chute.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Take your pre-addressed envelope to the US Post Office near you, purchase a stamp, place on envelope and drop in mail chute.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it includes the important step of placing the stamp on the envelope before dropping it in the mail chute. Without a stamp, the letter will not be delivered and may be returned to the sender. It is also important to go to the post office to ensure that the letter is properly processed and sent to the correct destination."}}
{"Q": "To keep from making a mess when putting holes in drywall.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tape an elastic below small drywall projects to keep clean-up easy. (B) Tape an envelope below small drywall projects to keep clean-up easy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tape an elastic below small drywall projects to keep clean-up easy.\nExplanation: Taping an elastic below small drywall projects can catch any debris or dust that falls while making holes in the drywall. The elastic will act as a barrier and prevent the debris from scattering all over the floor, making clean-up easier. Taping an envelope below small drywall projects is not a plausible answer as it is not designed to catch debris and may not be able to hold the weight of the debris."}}
{"Q": "how do you dispense of something?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) put it in a safe. (B) throw it away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Throw it away.\nExplanation: Disposing of something typically involves throwing it away in a trash can or recycling bin, depending on the item. Putting it in a safe is not a common method of disposal and would not be appropriate for most items."}}
{"Q": "How to make the dough for your peppermint candy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) In a large bowl cream butter and sugar until creamy, add extract and egg to the bowl and mix together. Add flour and salt into bowl and mix until all the ingredients become a hard dough. Cut dough in half and color one half with red food coloring and the other with green food coloring (B) In a large bowl cream butter and sugar until creamy, add extract and egg to the bowl and mix together. Add flour and salt into bowl and mix until all the ingredients become a soft dough. Cut dough in half and color one half with red food coloring and the other with green food coloring", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. In a large bowl cream butter and sugar until creamy, add extract and egg to the bowl and mix together. Add flour and salt into bowl and mix until all the ingredients become a hard dough. Cut dough in half and color one half with red food coloring and the other with green food coloring.\nExplanation: Peppermint candy typically has a hard texture, so it makes sense that the dough would also be hard. The process of creaming the butter and sugar until creamy is a common step in making dough, and adding the extract and egg would give the dough its peppermint flavor and help bind the ingredients together. Mixing in the flour and salt until the dough becomes hard is also a logical step. Finally, cutting the dough in half and coloring each half with red and green food coloring would create the classic peppermint candy look."}}
{"Q": "How should I drill the hole in the back of the frame?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Carefully poke a hole through the back by using a Phillips head screwdriver and striking the end with a hammer. You can eyeball the location since it doesn't have to be exact. (B) Carefully drill the hole with a portable drill with a small bit. You can eyeball the location since it doesn't have to be exact.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Using a portable drill with a small bit is a more precise and controlled method of drilling a hole in the back of a frame. It allows for a cleaner and more accurate hole, which is important if the frame will be hung on a wall or displayed in a prominent location. Eyeballing the location may work for some projects, but it's always better to be as precise as possible. Additionally, using a screwdriver and hammer can be dangerous and may damage the frame."}}
{"Q": "hands", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can get a tan palms up (B) can get sweaty palms up", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Hands can get a tan palms up because the skin on the palms is not as thick as the skin on the back of the hands, which allows some UV rays to penetrate and cause tanning. On the other hand, it is less likely for hands to get sweaty palms up because there are fewer sweat glands on the palms compared to the back of the hands."}}
{"Q": "How can I make glow sticks last longer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Refrigerate or place the glow sticks in the freezer to stop the glow sticks from glowing. Reheat the glow sticks carefully to make them glow again. (B) Store the glow sticks when not in use in a cool area. If possible, make sure the area is humid and moist, and away from direct light such as the sun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Storing glow sticks in a cool and dark place can help prolong their lifespan. Heat and light can cause the chemicals inside the glow sticks to react faster, which can lead to a shorter glow time. Keeping them in a humid and moist area can also help prevent the chemicals from drying out too quickly. Refrigerating or freezing the glow sticks can actually damage them and cause them to stop working altogether."}}
{"Q": "To prevent egg shells in your cookie dough,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) crack the eggs open over another smaller container first and check for egg shells before adding them to the rest of the dough (B) crack the eggs open over the container with the dough and check for egg shells before adding them to the rest of the dough", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Cracking the eggs open over another smaller container first and checking for egg shells before adding them to the rest of the dough is a more plausible answer because it allows you to catch any egg shells before they are mixed into the dough. This method ensures that the cookie dough remains free of any unwanted egg shells, resulting in a better quality cookie. Cracking the eggs open directly over the container with the dough increases the risk of egg shells falling into the dough and potentially ruining the entire batch."}}

It won't grow much in a small tank, but it will adjust. (B) The smallest size a Betta should have is 2 1/2 gallons. However, try to go bigger if you can. You want your fish to have lots of room to swim and grow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The smallest size a Betta should have is 2 1/2 gallons. However, try to go bigger if you can. You want your fish to have lots of room to swim and grow.\nExplanation: While Betta fish can survive in small tanks, it is not ideal for their health and well-being. A 2 1/2 gallon tank is the minimum recommended size for a Betta fish, but a larger tank will provide more space for the fish to swim and explore. It is important to remember that Betta fish are active and curious creatures that need room to move around and explore their environment. A larger tank will also make it easier to maintain water quality and provide a more stable environment for the fish."}}

{"Q": "Avoid wasting power in fridge.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Keep fridge 3/4 full. (B) Keep fridge 1/4 full.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Keep fridge 3/4 full.\nExplanation: Keeping the fridge 3/4 full helps to maintain a consistent temperature inside the fridge as the items in the fridge act as thermal mass. This means that when the door is opened, less cold air escapes and the fridge doesn't have to work as hard to maintain its temperature. On the other hand, keeping the fridge 1/4 full means that there is more air space inside the fridge, which can lead to more cold air escaping when the door is opened, causing the fridge to work harder to maintain its temperature. Therefore, keeping the fridge 3/4 full is a more plausible answer to avoid wasting power in the fridge."}}
{"Q": "To make a wine rack.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Figure out the materials that you will need and measure out what you will need to cut.

A cake pan, on the other hand, may not have as many compartments and may not be as practical for organizing tiny office supplies."}}
{"Q": "how do you fry a corn tortilla?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) place it in the microwave for one minute. (B) place it in a hot frying pan on top of oil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) place it in a hot frying pan on top of oil.\nExplanation: To fry a corn tortilla, it is best to heat up a frying pan with oil until it is hot. Then, carefully place the tortilla in the pan and let it cook for about 30 seconds to a minute on each side until it is crispy and golden brown. Microwaving the tortilla will not give it the same crispy texture as frying it in oil."}}
{"Q": "folder", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can be put into Christmas stockings  (B) can be put into Christmas logs ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a folder can be put into a Christmas stocking as a small gift or stocking stuffer. Putting a folder into a Christmas log does not make sense as logs are typically used for burning in a fireplace or as a decorative element in a holiday display."}}
{"Q": "Fall asleep easily.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Look at pictures of people laughing to trigger drowsy response. (B) Look at pictures of people sleeping to trigger drowsy response.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Looking at pictures of people sleeping is more likely to trigger a drowsy response as it signals to the brain that it is time to rest. Laughing, on the other hand, can stimulate the brain and make it harder to fall asleep. Additionally, looking at screens before bed can disrupt sleep patterns, so it is best to avoid looking at any screens, including pictures, before trying to fall asleep."}}
{"Q": "How do I open a water bottle if I can't do it with my hands", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wrap a small cloth or napkin around it then shake it (B) Wrap a small cloth or napkin around it then twist", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Wrap a small cloth or napkin around it then twist.\nExplanation: Wrapping a small cloth or napkin around the water bottle provides a better grip and prevents the bottle from slipping. Twisting the bottle with the cloth or napkin will apply more force and make it easier to open. Shaking the bottle with a cloth or napkin may not provide enough force to loosen the cap and could potentially spill the contents of the bottle."}}
{"Q": "Cut a book cleanly in half.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A band saw can cut a book cleanly in half. (B) A hack saw can cut a book cleanly in half.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A band saw can cut a book cleanly in half.\nExplanation: A band saw is a power tool that uses a continuous band of toothed metal to cut through various materials, including books. It is designed to make precise cuts and can easily cut through the pages of a book without damaging the spine or cover. On the other hand, a hack saw is a hand tool that is not suitable for cutting through a book cleanly and would likely result in a jagged and uneven cut. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}

The other steps in option B are also correct and necessary for cutting and sewing a circle ruffle."}}
{"Q": "How do I attach a screen to the top of a trash can?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Place some hardware cloth over the opening and then use a strong cord to bend the excess around the can and keep it in place. (B) Place some silken cloth over the opening and then use a phone cord to bend the excess around the can and keep it in place.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Place some hardware cloth over the opening and then use a strong cord to bend the excess around the can and keep it in place.\nExplanation: Hardware cloth is a sturdy material that can withstand the weight of trash and prevent it from falling out of the can. Using a strong cord to secure the excess cloth around the can will ensure that the screen stays in place and does not fall off. Silken cloth, on the other hand, is not strong enough to hold up against the weight of trash and may tear easily. A phone cord is also not strong enough to secure the screen in place."}}
{"Q": "To iron small spaces in between buttons on a shirt.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use a hair flat iron to get those small spaces between buttons. (B) Use a soldering iron to get those small spaces between buttons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Use a hair flat iron to get those small spaces between buttons.\nExplanation: Using a hair flat iron is a more plausible answer as it is designed to be used on fabrics and has a smaller surface area that can easily fit in between buttons. A soldering iron is not suitable for ironing clothes and can cause damage to the fabric. It is also not safe to use on clothing as it can get extremely hot and cause burns."}}
{"Q": "To create the perfect white russian.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put a white russian mix and ice in a blender and blend on high for 3 minutes until smooth. (B) Put white russian ingredients together in a shaker and shake it up and pour over ice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Put white russian ingredients together in a shaker and shake it up and pour over ice.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it follows the traditional method of making a white russian. The ingredients for a white russian are typically vodka, coffee liqueur, and heavy cream. Mixing them in a shaker allows for the ingredients to be properly combined and chilled before pouring over ice. Blending the mix and ice for 3 minutes may result in a watery and over-blended drink."}}

Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How do you dry herbs when making homemade herb oil?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place freshly washed and clean herbs in a cold refrigerator. (B) Place freshly washed and clean herbs in a food dehydrator.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Place freshly washed and clean herbs in a food dehydrator.\nExplanation: Drying herbs is an important step in making homemade herb oil as it helps to remove any excess moisture that can cause the oil to spoil. While placing herbs in a cold refrigerator can help to preserve their freshness, it does not effectively dry them out. On the other hand, using a food dehydrator is a more plausible option as it allows for controlled and even drying of the herbs, ensuring that they are completely dry before being added to the oil."}}
{"Q": "How do I get the weeds to stop coming back in my garden?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use some weed killer on your garden. (B) Use some fertilizer on your garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Use some weed killer on your garden.\nExplanation: Weed killer is specifically designed to kill weeds and prevent them from growing back. Fertilizer, on the other hand, is used to provide nutrients to plants to help them grow. While fertilizer may help your plants grow stronger and healthier, it will not necessarily prevent weeds from coming back. Therefore, using weed killer is a more plausible solution to stop weeds from coming back in your garden."}}

{"Q": "Spend a night in a parking lot without getting kicked out.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Park at a CVS. (B) Park at a Walmart.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Park at a Walmart.\nExplanation: Walmart is known for allowing overnight parking in their parking lots for RVs and travelers. They have a corporate policy that allows it, as long as the local laws permit it and the parking lot is not full. CVS, on the other hand, does not have a corporate policy allowing overnight parking and it is less likely to be tolerated by the store management or local authorities."}}
{"Q": "How do I know if a bell pepper is full of seeds?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) flip it over and look at the bumps, the ones with four are female, and have more seeds. (B) Ask a worker at the grocery store if they can do a price check, if the barcode scans twice, its seedy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The number of bumps on a bell pepper does not determine its gender, but rather its sweetness. However, female bell peppers do tend to have more seeds than male bell peppers. Therefore, flipping the bell pepper over and looking at the bumps can give an indication of how seedy it may be. However, this is not a foolproof method and the only way to know for sure is to cut open the pepper and inspect the inside."}}
{"Q": "To brighten the flavor of a fish taco,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) add extra gravy and bread crumbs to the fried fish. (B) use lime and vegetables and cheese as topping.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) use lime and vegetables and cheese as topping.\nExplanation: Adding extra gravy and bread crumbs to the fried fish would make it heavier and mask the flavor of the fish. Using lime and vegetables and cheese as toppings would add freshness and tanginess to the taco, enhancing the flavor of the fish. This is a more plausible option for brightening the flavor of a fish taco."}}

While it may be possible to use tape to keep a window closed in certain situations, it is not a common or recommended method for securing windows. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "listen", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can hear record the sound of a birds wings ride by (B) can hear a bird  ride by", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible to hear the sound of a bird's wings flapping as it flies by rather than just hearing the bird itself riding by. The sound of the wings flapping is a distinct and noticeable sound that can be heard from a distance, while the sound of a bird riding by would be much quieter and less noticeable. Additionally, birds typically fly rather than ride, making option A the more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "How can I soak up spills on concrete?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use gravel kitty litter on spills. (B) Use dry cat food on spills.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Use gravel kitty litter on spills.\nExplanation: Gravel kitty litter is made of absorbent clay that can quickly soak up spills on concrete. It is a common and effective method used by many homeowners and businesses to clean up spills. Dry cat food, on the other hand, is not designed for absorbing spills and may not be as effective."}}

{"Q": "Hardened ceilings", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can keep out swift and quick aerial drones from distant lands (B) can keep out rushing water from distant lands", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Hardened ceilings are typically designed to withstand impact from aerial threats such as missiles or bombs. While rushing water can certainly cause damage to a building, it is unlikely that a hardened ceiling would be necessary to prevent it from entering a building from a distant land. Swift and quick aerial drones, on the other hand, are becoming increasingly common and could potentially pose a threat to buildings and infrastructure. Therefore, it is more plausible that a hardened ceiling would be designed to keep out aerial drones rather than rushing water."}}
{"Q": "To repair a dented automobile bumper at home.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use boiling water and a hair dryer to heat the plastic bumper, making sure to keep the water and hair dryer far apart to avoid electric shock, then, from below, press it back into shape with a baseball bat. (B) Use boiling water and a hair dryer to heat the plastic bumper, making sure to keep the water and hair dryer close together to cause electric shock, then, from below, press it back into shape with a baseball bat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Using boiling water and a hair dryer to heat the plastic bumper can help make it more pliable and easier to reshape. However, it is important to keep the water and hair dryer far apart to avoid any risk of electric shock.

{"Q": "Make gourmet marshmallows.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Stuff marshmallows with peanut butter before roasting. (B) Stuff marshmallows with salt before roasting.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Stuff marshmallows with peanut butter before roasting.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because peanut butter is a common and popular ingredient that pairs well with marshmallows. The creamy texture of the peanut butter will also add a nice contrast to the fluffy texture of the marshmallow. On the other hand, stuffing marshmallows with salt before roasting may not be as appealing to most people as it could make the marshmallows too salty and overpowering."}}
{"Q": "Butcher Shop", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) will decimate fish from the ocean into digestible pieces (B) will decimate a full cow into digestible pieces", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) will decimate a full cow into digestible pieces.\nExplanation: While fish are commonly sold in butcher shops, it is unlikely that a single shop would be responsible for decimating the entire ocean's fish population. On the other hand, it is common for butcher shops to sell various cuts of beef, including a full cow that has been broken down into smaller, digestible pieces. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How to cook meat on a fire pit without a grill?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gather a large and flat rock, clean it and lay it on the coals, once it heats up place the meat directly on the rock (B) Gather a small and sharp rock, clean it and lay it on the coals, before it heats up place the meat directly on the rock", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Gather a large and flat rock, clean it and lay it on the coals, once it heats up place the meat directly on the rock.\n\nExplanation: Option A is a more plausible answer because a large and flat rock can retain heat for a longer period of time, allowing the meat to cook evenly. Additionally, cleaning the rock before use ensures that there are no harmful substances or bacteria on it that could contaminate the meat. Option B, on the other hand, suggests using a small and sharp rock which may not be able to retain heat as well and could potentially puncture the meat, causing it to fall into the fire."}}
{"Q": "machete", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can lay on the tablecloth  (B) can fold a tablecloth ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: A machete is a long, flat blade with a sharp edge, and it is not flexible or foldable. Therefore, it is more plausible that a machete can lay on a tablecloth rather than fold it."}}

(B) Yes, you can try putting baby oil on your car and it will repel things from sticking to your car.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Yes, you can try Water Armour. It helps with tar and grime and makes cleaning easier.\nExplanation: Water Armour is a product that creates a hydrophobic barrier on your car's surface, which repels water and prevents dirt and grime from sticking to it. It also helps with tar and makes cleaning easier. This product is a more plausible answer as baby oil may not be suitable for use on a car's surface and may cause damage to the paint."}}
{"Q": "What can you use to sound dampen your room?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) You can use foam panels and securely hang them on your wall. (B) You can use a foam mattress and rip it apart and glue it to your wall.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. You can use foam panels and securely hang them on your wall.\nExplanation: Foam panels are a common and effective way to sound dampen a room. They are designed specifically for this purpose and are easy to install. Simply hang them on your walls using adhesive or screws. Foam panels absorb sound waves and reduce echoes, making your room quieter and more comfortable. On the other hand, ripping apart a foam mattress and gluing it to your wall is not a practical solution as it would be messy, time-consuming, and may not provide the same level of sound dampening as foam panels."}}

Cut a feather boa into similar lengths and hang them from the bottom of the dream catcher with fishing line.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it involves cutting the feather boa into similar lengths, which will create a more uniform and aesthetically pleasing look. Hanging them from the bottom of the dream catcher with fishing line will also ensure that they are securely attached and won't fall off easily. Shredding the feather boa into tiny bits may create a messy and uneven appearance, and it may be difficult to attach them to the dream catcher in a way that looks neat and tidy."}}
{"Q": "To make the monkeys ears on the monkey cupcake", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Take two mini vanilla wafers and place them out to either side letting the wafer hang off the monkeys head. (B) Take two bananas and place them under either side letting the banana hang off the monkeys mouth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Take two mini vanilla wafers and place them out to either side letting the wafer hang off the monkey's head.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it uses a food item that is commonly used in baking and decorating, and it resembles the shape of a monkey's ears. Bananas, on the other hand, are not typically used for decorating cupcakes and would not create the desired effect for the monkey's ears."}}
{"Q": "To shape the Popsicle sticks into a sunflower shape.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Glue the Popsicle sticks to an embroidery ring. (B) Tie the Popsicle sticks together using string.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Glue the Popsicle sticks to an embroidery ring.\nExplanation: Gluing the Popsicle sticks to an embroidery ring would provide a sturdy base for shaping the sticks into a sunflower shape. The ring would also help maintain the circular shape of the sunflower. Tying the sticks together using string may not provide enough stability and could result in a lopsided or uneven sunflower shape."}}
{"Q": "To allow dough to become firm, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Knead the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and chill in the closet (B) Knead the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Chilling dough in the fridge is a common method to allow it to become firm. The cool temperature slows down the activity of the yeast and other ingredients, making the dough easier to handle and shape. Chilling in the closet would not provide the necessary cool temperature and could also expose the dough to other contaminants."}}

(B) Buy some wolf urine from the store and spray it all over the edges of your property line.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Buy some wolf urine from the store and spray it all over the edges of your property line.\nExplanation: Skunks are natural prey for wolves, so the scent of wolf urine can act as a deterrent for skunks. Human urine may not be as effective as it does not have the same predator-prey relationship with skunks. Additionally, using human urine may not be socially acceptable in some areas. It is important to note that while wolf urine may be effective in deterring skunks, it may also attract other predators such as coyotes or foxes."}}

{"Q": "what is a great  rub for chicken?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) add a bit of hot chocolate mix to a teaspoon of rice flour, and coat the chicken inside and out (B) grind dried lime peels with whole chilis, and rub on the chicken.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. grind dried lime peels with whole chilis, and rub on the chicken.\nExplanation: This option seems more plausible as it uses traditional spices and flavors commonly used in chicken rubs. Lime and chili are a great combination for adding flavor and heat to chicken. The grinding of the dried lime peels and whole chilis will also help to release their flavors and aromas, making for a more flavorful rub. The hot chocolate mix in option A may not be a common ingredient in chicken rubs and may not complement the flavors of the chicken as well as the lime and chili in option B."}}
{"Q": "To get wrinkles out of shirts or slacks.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put two or three popsicles in the dryer along with one or two pieces of clothing and place it on the hottest setting.

Dragging the paintbrush along the area where the pictures were glued will ensure that the finish covers the entire surface evenly. Once the finish dries, it will protect the pictures and the wood from damage and wear. Using a black wood finish, as suggested in option A, may darken the pictures and the wood, which may not be desirable."}}
{"Q": "Where can I find good music to listen to", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The best place to find music is on Netflix.com (B) The best place to find music is on Youtube.com", "R": {"text": "Answer: The best place to find music is on Youtube.com.\nExplanation: Youtube is a popular platform for music lovers to discover new artists and songs. It has a vast collection of music videos, live performances, and covers from various genres and languages. Additionally, Youtube's algorithm suggests personalized playlists based on your listening history, making it easier to find music that suits your taste.

(B) Mosquitos hate the smell of Victoria’s Secret Bombshell in fact, the perfume was nearly as effective as DEET at repelling mosquitos over the course of two hours.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Mosquitos hate the smell of Victoria’s Secret Bombshell in fact, the perfume was nearly as effective as DEET at repelling mosquitos over the course of two hours.\nExplanation: Studies have shown that certain fragrances, such as Victoria's Secret Bombshell, can be effective at repelling mosquitoes. This is because mosquitoes are attracted to certain scents, such as sweat and body odor, and the fragrance of the perfume can mask those scents and make it harder for mosquitoes to find you. However, it's important to note that while fragrances can be helpful in repelling mosquitoes, they are not as effective as DEET or other insect repellents. It's still important to take other precautions, such as wearing long sleeves and pants and using mosquito nets, especially in areas where mosquito-borne illnesses are a concern."}}

Bake in oven until egg whites are browned (about 12 min.. check this though and remove when you like the appearance. Enjoy.\n\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because meringue is traditionally made with egg whites, not whole eggs. Additionally, the baking temperature of 275 degrees in option B is too low for meringue to properly brown and set. Option A's baking time and temperature are more appropriate for making meringue clouds."}}
{"Q": "piece of nylon pantyhose", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) cover face  (B) cover building ", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) cover building\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a piece of nylon pantyhose would be used to cover a building, such as during construction or renovation, rather than to cover a face. Using pantyhose to cover a face could be seen as suspicious or potentially harmful, whereas using it to cover a building is a common practice in the construction industry."}}
{"Q": "Remove hair from kitchen drain.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Pour full 2 liter bottle of coke soda down kitchen drain. (B) Pour full 2 liter bottle of club soda down kitchen drain.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Pour full 2 liter bottle of club soda down kitchen drain.\nExplanation: Club soda contains carbonic acid which can break down hair and other organic materials that may be clogging the drain. Coke soda may also contain some acid, but it is not as effective as club soda. Additionally, pouring a full 2 liter bottle of any soda down the drain may not be necessary and could potentially cause other issues. It is best to start with a smaller amount and see if it helps before resorting to a larger quantity."}}
{"Q": "To keep plants watered while on vacation.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Simply roll up some paper towels as tight as possible without them breaking, dunk the ends in a glass of water, and lay the remaining across the soil so that each plant is at least a few yards away. (B) Simply roll up some paper towels as tight as possible without them breaking, dunk the ends in a glass of water, and lay the remaining across the soil so that each plant is at least a few inches away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it suggests placing the paper towels a few inches away from each plant, which allows for better absorption of water by the soil. Placing the paper towels a few yards away, as suggested in option A, may not provide enough water to the plants and may also cause water to evaporate before it reaches the soil."}}
{"Q": "sticks", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can poke jello  (B) can poke DNA ", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) can poke jello\nExplanation: Sticks are solid objects that can be used to poke or prod soft substances like jello.

{"Q": "To charge a phone while out in public with only the charger,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) ask a friendly looking stranger on the street to charge it. (B) take the phone into a coffee shop and use the free power.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) take the phone into a coffee shop and use the free power.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it is safer and more reliable than asking a stranger on the street to charge the phone. In a coffee shop, there are usually outlets available for customers to use, and it is a common practice to charge devices while enjoying a drink or snack. Additionally, it is a more secure option as the phone can be kept within sight while charging."}}
{"Q": "fertilizer", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can be used for  growing plants  (B) can be used for  growing rocks ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Fertilizers are specifically designed to provide essential nutrients to plants, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are necessary for their growth and development. Rocks, on the other hand, do not require any nutrients to grow, as they are non-living materials. Therefore, it is more plausible that fertilizers are used for growing plants rather than rocks."}}
{"Q": "Make air freshener.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Spray packing peanuts with gasoline and put in empty jar. (B) Spray packing peanuts with perfume and put in empty jar.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Spray packing peanuts with perfume and put in empty jar.\nExplanation: Using gasoline as an air freshener is not only dangerous but also harmful to the environment. On the other hand, spraying packing peanuts with perfume can help to absorb and release pleasant scents into the air. The packing peanuts can be placed in an empty jar with holes on the lid to allow the scent to diffuse. This method is safer and more practical for creating an air freshener."}}
{"Q": "How to wash your face?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Wet your face with the sink. Put some gentle soap onto your hands and massage it into your face evenly. Use the water from the sink to rinse the soap off. (B) Wet your face with the sink. Put some dish soap onto your hands and massage it into your face evenly. Use the water from the sink to rinse the soap off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Using gentle soap specifically made for facial cleansing is important to avoid irritation and dryness. Dish soap is not meant for use on the face and can be too harsh, causing damage to the skin. Rinsing with water from the sink is a common and effective way to remove the soap and dirt from the face."}}
{"Q": "Set up a magazine holder.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lay old side of wooden baby crib against the wall. (B) Lay old side of wooden baby crib on the floor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because a magazine holder is meant to be mounted on a wall for easy access and organization. Laying the old side of a wooden baby crib against the wall provides a sturdy surface to attach the magazine holder and keeps it off the floor, making it easier to reach and less likely to get damaged. Laying it on the floor would not be practical for a magazine holder."}}
{"Q": "hands", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can touch water  (B) can touch fire ", "R": {"text": "Answer: Hands can touch water.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that hands can touch water as water is a common substance that can be found in many places, such as in lakes, rivers, and oceans. On the other hand, touching fire with bare hands can cause severe burns and is not a common or safe practice."}}
{"Q": "how do you pick up toys?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) hold them in your hands. (B) put them all away in their own spots.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Put them all away in their own spots.\nExplanation: Holding all the toys in your hands may not be practical or efficient, especially if there are many toys. Putting them away in their own spots not only helps with organization but also makes it easier to find and access the toys later on. This also teaches children responsibility and helps them develop good habits for keeping their space tidy."}}
{"Q": "rope", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can be put around a wall  (B) can be put around a pillar ", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: A rope can be easily wrapped around a pillar, as it provides a sturdy and stable surface for the rope to grip onto. However, putting a rope around a wall would require additional equipment or tools to secure it properly, making it less plausible."}}
{"Q": "how do you open a wine bottle?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) take the cork out of the top. (B) cut a hole in the cork on top.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Take the cork out of the top.\nExplanation: This is the most common and traditional way of opening a wine bottle. You can use a corkscrew to insert into the cork and twist it out of the bottle. Cutting a hole in the cork on top is not a practical method as it may damage the cork and make it difficult to remove."}}
{"Q": "broom", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can clean up water spills (B) can clean up dry coffee ground spills", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Brooms are typically used to clean up dry spills such as coffee grounds, dirt, or crumbs. While some brooms may be able to sweep up small amounts of water, they are not designed for cleaning up large spills or standing water. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}

Transfer fudge to Greased 8 x 13\" pan and let cool before cutting into squares.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Using pigs blood in a recipe is not only unappetizing but also unsanitary. Blood is not a common ingredient in fudge recipes and could potentially be harmful if not handled properly. Blood orange juice is a more appropriate and flavorful substitute for a Halloween-themed fudge recipe."}}

(B) Find the thumbs up button, below and slightly to the right of the video. Right click it once.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Find the thumbs down button, below and slightly to the right of the video. Left click it once.\nExplanation: To dislike a video on YouTube, you need to find the thumbs down button, which is located below and slightly to the right of the video. Once you have located the button, left click it once to register your dislike for the video. This is the most plausible answer as it accurately describes the process of disliking a video on YouTube. Right-clicking the thumbs up button, as suggested in option B, will not register a dislike for the video."}}
{"Q": "Squeeze a lemon wedge into a drink.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Taking the lemon wedge in between your hands, hold it over the drink and squeeze your hands together, letting the juice drip out into the drink. (B) Taking the lemon wedge lengthwise in between your fingers, hold it over the drink and squeeze the ends inward towards the thicker center.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer as it describes the correct way to squeeze a lemon wedge to extract the maximum amount of juice. Squeezing the ends inward towards the thicker center helps to release the juice without any seeds falling into the drink. Option A may not be as effective as it does not provide enough pressure to extract all the juice from the lemon wedge."}}
{"Q": "To clean out your dishwasher,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) scrub it all and then run an empty cycle with hot soapy water. (B) scrub it all and then run an empty cycle with cold soapy water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Hot water is more effective in breaking down and removing grease and grime, which is likely to be present in a dishwasher. Running an empty cycle with hot soapy water will help to sanitize and remove any buildup in the dishwasher. Cold water may not be as effective in cleaning and sanitizing the dishwasher."}}
{"Q": "To make a ball of aluminum foil,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) take a sheet of aluminum foil and fold it in half (B) take a sheet of aluminum foil and crinkle it into a ball.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: To make a ball of aluminum foil, it is more plausible to take a sheet of aluminum foil and crinkle it into a ball.

{"Q": "repel flies", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) add a few (B) add penny to a glass of water", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Adding a penny to a glass of water is a common folk remedy for repelling flies. The reason behind this is that the copper in the penny reacts with the water and creates a slight odor that flies find unpleasant. While adding a few of something may work in some cases, it is not a proven method for repelling flies. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "If you want to get money from an ATM or other cash cheaply with no fees what can you do?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) If you want to get cash, simply buy something for .99 like a soda, and get cash back from the cashier that way you have ZERO ATM fees. (B) If you want to get cash, simply buy something for 999.99 like a Motorcycle, and get cash back from the cashier that way you have ZERO ATM fees.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. If you want to get cash, simply buy something for .99 like a soda, and get cash back from the cashier that way you have ZERO ATM fees.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because many stores offer cash back options when you make a purchase with a debit card. By buying something small like a soda, you can avoid any additional fees that may come with using an ATM. However, it's important to note that some stores may have a limit on how much cash you can get back, so it's best to check with the cashier beforehand."}}
{"Q": "Prevent drying paint.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place paint brushes in newspaper until ready for use again. (B) Place paint brushes in ziploc until ready for use again.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Place paint brushes in ziploc until ready for use again.\nExplanation: Placing paint brushes in a ziploc bag will prevent the paint from drying out by creating an airtight seal. This will keep the brushes moist and ready for use again without the need for cleaning and reapplication of paint. Using newspaper may not provide a sufficient barrier to prevent air from drying out the paint."}}

{"Q": "To prolong the life time of your flowers.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Drop a button into the vase and add a pinch of sugar. (B) Drop a penny into the vase and add a pinch of sugar.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Drop a button into the vase and add a pinch of sugar.\nExplanation: Adding a button to the vase can help to keep the stems of the flowers separated, allowing for better water flow. The sugar provides nutrients for the flowers to help them last longer. On the other hand, adding a penny to the vase may actually harm the flowers as the copper in the penny can be toxic to them.

After rising the knife with water and soap, use a kitchen towel and then a piece of paper towel to dry the knife.\nExplanation: Using a kitchen towel to dry the knife after washing it with soap and water is a good practice as it is clean and absorbent. However, using a piece of paper towel after the kitchen towel ensures that any remaining moisture is removed, leaving the knife completely dry. Using a standard towel (option B) may not be as effective as it may leave lint or fibers on the knife, which can be unsanitary."}}
{"Q": "marker", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) erases  pencil marks (B) instead of pencil ", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The marker is an alternative to using a pencil, so it would not make sense for it to erase pencil marks."}}
{"Q": "How can I keep a bathroom mirror from fogging up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Wipe down with shaving cream. (B) Wipe down with shaving razor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Wipe down with shaving cream.\nExplanation: Shaving cream contains a surfactant that can prevent condensation from forming on the mirror. Simply apply a small amount of shaving cream to the mirror, spread it evenly, and then wipe it off with a clean cloth. This will create a thin film on the mirror that will prevent fogging. Using a shaving razor to wipe down the mirror is not a plausible answer as it can scratch the surface of the mirror and damage it."}}

(B) Paint it completely silver with acrylic paint, then dry brush with a tiny bit of silver paint to add highlights and depth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Paint it completely black with acrylic paint, then dry brush with a tiny bit of silver paint to add highlights and depth.\nExplanation: The Iron Throne in the Game of Thrones series is known for its dark and ominous appearance, so painting the cardboard cat bed completely black would be a fitting tribute to the show. Adding silver highlights with dry brushing would give the bed a metallic look, similar to the actual Iron Throne. Painting it completely silver may be too bright and not as true to the show's aesthetic."}}
{"Q": "Moisturize skin without lotion.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rub skin with vegetable oil. (B) Rub skin with coconut oil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Rub skin with coconut oil.\nExplanation: Coconut oil is a natural moisturizer that is easily absorbed by the skin. It contains fatty acids that help to hydrate and nourish the skin, leaving it soft and smooth. Vegetable oil may also work as a moisturizer, but it may not be as effective as coconut oil due to its composition. Additionally, coconut oil has a pleasant scent and is widely available in stores, making it a convenient option for moisturizing the skin."}}
{"Q": "to make it easier to push the reset button of the garbage disposable machine which is located underneath the machine", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) place a wall mirror on the floor of the cabinet (B) hold a hand mirror under the garbage disposable machine", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Place a wall mirror on the floor of the cabinet.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it allows for a larger surface area to be covered, making it easier to locate and push the reset button. Holding a hand mirror under the machine would require a lot of precision and may not provide enough visibility.

{"Q": "To more easily access popular rides at a theme park,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) go to the theme park a day after a drinking based holiday. (B) go to the theme park on a popular holiday instead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) go to the theme park on a popular holiday instead.\nExplanation: Going to a theme park on a popular holiday means that many people will be taking the day off work or school to visit the park, which can result in longer wait times for popular rides. However, this also means that the park will likely have extended hours and additional staff to accommodate the crowds, which can help to offset the longer wait times. Going to the park a day after a drinking based holiday may result in fewer crowds, but it is not a reliable strategy as it depends on the specific holiday and the park's location. Additionally, it is not a safe or responsible choice to visit a theme park after consuming alcohol."}}

(B) Get gas at the hottest part of the day, usually early morning or very late at night, gas expands and contracts 1 percent for every 15 degrees, the cooler the temperature of the gas, the more you get.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Get gas at the coolest part of the day, usually early morning or very late at night, gas expands and contracts 1 percent for every 15 degrees, the cooler the temperature of the gas, the more you get.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is based on the scientific fact that gas expands and contracts with temperature changes. Getting gas at the coolest part of the day means that the gas will be denser, and you will get more gas for your money. Getting gas at the hottest part of the day would mean that the gas is less dense, and you would get less gas for your money."}}

Using a straw also ensures that you don't accidentally squish or damage the berry while removing the top."}}
{"Q": "To keep necklaces from getting tangled when traveling.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Loop the necklaces through a straw and close the clasp so they won't get tangled. (B) Loop the necklaces through an earring and close the clasp so they won't get tangled.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Loop the necklaces through a straw and close the clasp so they won't get tangled.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because the straw provides a straight and smooth surface for the necklaces to slide through, preventing them from getting tangled. The clasp can also be closed to keep the necklaces secure. Using an earring may not provide enough space for the necklaces to slide through, and the earring itself may get tangled with the necklaces."}}
{"Q": "How do I prepare my parchment paper when making pavlova cookies at home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cut two sheets of parchment paper to fit the cookie sheet and trace circles on the parchment paper where you want your cookies to be.

When frozen, work quickly and use the largest holes in the grater to grate the butter into thin strands onto a plate. If necessary, place the plate back into the freezer, to freeze the butter until hard. (B) When making pastry, freeze the amount of butter you need in a freezer, alongside a metal box cutter. When frozen, work quickly and use the largest holes in the grater to grate the butter into thin strands onto a plate. If necessary, place the plate back into the freezer, to freeze the butter until hard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Freezing the butter before grating it will prevent it from melting and becoming too soft to work with. Using a metal box grater with the largest holes will create thin strands of butter that can easily be incorporated into pastry dough. Placing the grated butter back into the freezer will ensure that it stays firm and doesn't melt during the pastry-making process. Using a box cutter instead of a grater is not a viable option as it will not create the same texture and consistency needed for pastry dough."}}

{"Q": "To peel the shell off of a hard boiled egg.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) To begin peeling your eggs lightly tap the egg on some paper towel and crack the shell all over. Then with your thumb begin to peel the shell towards the egg. (B) To begin peeling your eggs lightly tap the egg on some paper towel and crack the shell all over. Then with your thumb begin to peel the shell away from the egg.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) To begin peeling your eggs lightly tap the egg on some paper towel and crack the shell all over. Then with your thumb begin to peel the shell away from the egg.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is important to peel the shell away from the egg to avoid removing chunks of the egg white with the shell. Peeling the shell towards the egg can cause the egg white to stick to the shell and make it difficult to remove. Additionally, cracking the shell all over helps to loosen the shell from the egg, making it easier to peel."}}
{"Q": "To use a splash of vanilla extract,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) tip the bottle upside down and let the contents splash into the mixing bowl. (B) pour a small amount into a soup spoon and drop it into the mixing bowl.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) pour a small amount into a soup spoon and drop it into the mixing bowl.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it allows for better control over the amount of vanilla extract being added to the mixture. Tipping the bottle upside down could result in too much extract being added, which could overpower the other flavors in the recipe. Using a spoon to measure out a small amount ensures that the recipe will have the right balance of flavors."}}
{"Q": "Brush dust off eyebrows.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use toothbrush to groom. (B) Use dental floss to groom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Use toothbrush to groom.\nExplanation: Using dental floss to groom eyebrows is not a plausible answer as it is not designed for that purpose and could potentially harm the delicate skin around the eyebrows. On the other hand, using a toothbrush to groom eyebrows is a common practice as it helps to remove dust and keep the eyebrows neat without causing any harm."}}
{"Q": "How to drain a bath tub.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Reach down to the drain plug, and push it. Wait for the water to gradually drain out of the tub. (B) Reach down to the drain plug, and pull it. Wait for the water to gradually drain out of the tub.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: To drain a bath tub, you need to reach down to the drain plug and push it.

The combination of watermelon, vanilla ice cream, and a pinch of salt is also a common recipe for watermelon shakes."}}
{"Q": "sleeves", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Can be cut by sciscors with ease (B) Can be cut by a knife with ease", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Can be cut by scissors with ease.\nExplanation: Sleeves are typically made of fabric, which can be easily cut with scissors. While a knife could also cut through fabric, it would require more effort and precision than simply using scissors. Additionally, using a knife to cut sleeves could potentially damage the fabric or create jagged edges, whereas scissors would provide a cleaner cut. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "To prepare plums for filling.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Plums, washed and steamed dry. You can either halved them, or quartered them. Depending how big you want your dumplings to be. If you quartered them, this recipe should make at least 20 dumplings. (B) Plums, washed and patted dry. You can either halved them, or quartered them. Depending how big you want your dumplings to be. If you quartered them, this recipe should make at least 20 dumplings.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Plums, washed and patted dry. You can either halved them, or quartered them. Depending how big you want your dumplings to be. If you quartered them, this recipe should make at least 20 dumplings.\nExplanation: It is more plausible to pat the plums dry rather than steam them dry as steaming may make the plums too soft and difficult to handle.

{"Q": "thimble", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can fit on a jar  (B) can fit on a crayon ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: A thimble is typically used for sewing and is designed to fit on the tip of a finger to protect it from the needle. Therefore, it is more plausible that a thimble can fit on a jar, which is a common household item that can have a small opening that a thimble could fit on, rather than a crayon, which is not typically associated with sewing and does not have a suitable shape for a thimble to fit on."}}
{"Q": "To secure the thread when using your sewing machine.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Remember to back stitch at the start and end of your sewn lines to secure the yarn. (B) Remember to back stitch at the start and end of your sewn lines to secure the thread.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Remember to back stitch at the start and end of your sewn lines to secure the thread.\nExplanation: Back stitching is a common technique used in sewing to secure the thread at the beginning and end of a seam. This prevents the thread from unraveling and ensures that the seam stays intact. While yarn can also be used for sewing, it is more commonly associated with knitting and crocheting, and may not be as strong or suitable for machine sewing. Therefore, it is more plausible that the question is referring to thread, and that back stitching is the correct answer for securing it."}}
{"Q": "To attach the wooden boards the LED lights will be attached to the wall.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use nails to place the boards. (B) Use picture hangers to place the boards.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Use picture hangers to place the boards.\nExplanation: Using nails to place the boards may damage the wall and may not provide enough support for the weight of the boards and LED lights.

{"Q": "how do you buckle down on something?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) leave it alone. (B) concentrate on nothing else.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) concentrate on nothing else.\nExplanation: To buckle down on something means to focus and work hard on it. Therefore, the most plausible answer is to concentrate on nothing else but the task at hand. This means eliminating distractions and giving your full attention to the task until it is completed."}}
{"Q": "To pour hot fudge over ice cream before serving,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) pour the hot fudge over ice cream that has just been pulled from the freezer and scooped out of it's container with an ice cream scoop into a bowl. (B) pour the hot fudge over ice cream that has been pulled out of the freezer and softened for fifteen minutes, then scooped out of it's container with an ice cream scoop into a bowl.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) pour the hot fudge over ice cream that has been pulled out of the freezer and softened for fifteen minutes, then scooped out of its container with an ice cream scoop into a bowl.\nExplanation: Softening the ice cream for fifteen minutes will make it easier to scoop and will prevent it from being too hard and difficult to eat. Pouring hot fudge over ice cream that is too hard can cause it to become icy and unpleasant. Softening the ice cream slightly will allow the hot fudge to melt into the ice cream, creating a delicious and creamy dessert."}}
{"Q": "To make extra money in your neighborhood,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) offer a dog walking service for your neighborhood. (B) offer up free tutorials in an area of your expertise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Offer a dog walking service for your neighborhood.\nExplanation: Offering a dog walking service is a more plausible answer as it is a service that is in demand and can be easily provided in a neighborhood. Many people have busy schedules and may not have the time to walk their dogs regularly, so offering a dog walking service can be a convenient solution for them. Additionally, it requires minimal investment and can be a great way to earn extra money while getting some exercise and spending time with furry friends. On the other hand, offering free tutorials in an area of expertise may not be as profitable as it requires a lot of time and effort to create and promote the tutorials, and there may not be a high demand for them in a neighborhood setting."}}
{"Q": "how do you clean the pumpkin seeds?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Separate the seeds from the stringy pulp, rinse the seeds in a colander under cold water, then shake dry. (B) Separate the seeds from the stringy pulp, rinse the seeds in a pot under cold water, then shake dry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Separate the seeds from the stringy pulp, rinse the seeds in a colander under cold water, then shake dry.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because rinsing the seeds in a colander allows for better water flow and easier removal of any remaining pulp. Rinsing in a pot may not allow for proper drainage and could make it more difficult to remove any remaining pulp. Additionally, shaking the seeds dry after rinsing is a common method for removing excess water and ensuring the seeds are ready for roasting."}}
{"Q": "To prevent dust from getting into resin design while it dries.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Shake the resin periodically while it dries. (B) Cover the resin while it dries.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Cover the resin while it dries.\nExplanation: Covering the resin while it dries is a more plausible answer as it prevents dust from settling on the surface of the resin and getting trapped inside the design. Shaking the resin periodically may cause air bubbles to form and ruin the design. Therefore, covering the resin with a lid or plastic wrap is the best way to keep it dust-free while it dries."}}

Your stencil should look like a simplified version of the original design. If you are using a computer, you can get this done by using an editing program and playing around with the settings. \n\nExplanation: To get an airbrush painting onto a material surface, you first need to create a stencil of the design you want to paint. The stencil should be a simplified version of the original design, with clear lines and shapes that can be easily painted with an airbrush. If you are using a computer to create the stencil, you can use an editing program to simplify the design and adjust the settings to make it easier to paint. Once you have the stencil, you can use an airbrush to paint the design onto the material surface."}}
{"Q": "To substitute for eggs in a banana bread recipe,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) measure 1/2 cup of a green banana that you have peeled and mashed with a fork in place of one egg. (B) measure 1/4 cup of a ripe banana that you have peeled and mashed with a fork in place of one egg.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) measure 1/2 cup of a green banana that you have peeled and mashed with a fork in place of one egg.\nExplanation: Green bananas contain more starch than ripe bananas, which can help bind ingredients together like eggs do in baking. Ripe bananas, on the other hand, are too soft and sweet to act as a good substitute for eggs. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "how do you save a message on snapchat?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) hold down the message you want to save until it is highlighted. (B) hold down the message you want to save until it is unhighlighted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: To save a message on Snapchat, you need to hold down the message you want to save until it is highlighted. Once it is highlighted, it will be saved to your chat history. If you hold down the message until it is unhighlighted, it will be deleted. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "To get carrots to grow in your garden.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Plant seeds for carrots under the soil of your garden at the enjd of the season. (B) Plant seeds for carrots under the soil of your garden at the beginning of the season.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Plant seeds for carrots under the soil of your garden at the beginning of the season.\nExplanation: Carrots are a cool-season crop that requires a long growing season, so it is best to plant the seeds in early spring, about 2-3 weeks before the last expected frost date. Planting at the end of the season would not give the carrots enough time to mature before the first frost, and they may not grow properly. Therefore, planting seeds for carrots under the soil of your garden at the beginning of the season is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "To dry potatoes for frying,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) place cleaned drained potatoes onto paper towels and let sit for 20 minutes until dry. (B) place cleaned drained potatoes onto a bath towel and let sit for 2 minutes until dry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Paper towels are more absorbent than bath towels and can effectively remove excess moisture from the potatoes, making them crispier when fried. Allowing the potatoes to sit for 20 minutes also gives enough time for the moisture to evaporate, ensuring that the potatoes are completely dry before frying. On the other hand, two minutes may not be enough time for the potatoes to dry thoroughly using a bath towel."}}
{"Q": "Wire Racks", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can hold pennies.  (B) can hold cups ", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that wire racks can hold cups as they are commonly used for storing and organizing kitchenware.

Sprinkle inside of shoes with dry shampoo.\nExplanation: Sprinkling dry shampoo on the inside of the shoes can help absorb moisture and prevent sweating. Sprinkling it on the outside of the shoes may not be effective in preventing sweating and may also leave a visible residue. Additionally, dry shampoo is designed to absorb oil and sweat, making it a more plausible solution for preventing sweaty feet."}}
{"Q": "To start the bed bench project for your bed,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gather all the tools and the wood pallet for the bench and measure the bed needing the bench. (B) Get all the tools and measure bed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Gather all the tools and the wood pallet for the bench and measure the bed needing the bench.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it includes gathering all the necessary tools and materials for the project, as well as measuring the bed to ensure the bench will fit properly. Without measuring the bed, the bench may end up being too big or too small, which would defeat the purpose of the project. Additionally, gathering all the tools and materials beforehand will make the project run more smoothly and efficiently."}}
{"Q": "How do you ensure a potted succulent will drain well?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Make sure there is a hole in the bottom of the container. Put small rocks and stones in the bottom of the container before the soil. (B) Make sure there is no hole in the bottom of the container. Put small rocks and stones in the bottom of the container before the soil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Make sure there is a hole in the bottom of the container. Put small rocks and stones in the bottom of the container before the soil.\nExplanation: Having a hole in the bottom of the container is essential for proper drainage. Without it, water will accumulate at the bottom and cause root rot.

(B) Mix 1 cup chopped  Mangoes, 1 cup chopped pineapple, 1/2 cup chopped coconut 3/4 cup water, 1 cup sugar and stir over medium heat on stove for 30 min.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Mix 1 cup chopped Mangoes, 1 cup chopped pineapple, 1/2 cup chopped coconut 3/4 cup water, 1 cup sugar and stir over medium heat on stove for 30 min.\nExplanation: This option seems more plausible as it includes chopped fruits instead of just their rinds or oils. Chopping the fruits will release their natural flavors and juices, which will enhance the taste of the sauce. Additionally, the use of water will help to create a more liquid consistency, making it easier to use as a sauce. The sugar will add sweetness to balance out the tartness of the fruits. Overall, this recipe seems like a more realistic way to make a tropical storm sauce at home."}}

{"Q": "What is the best way to apply nail polish to a professional result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A quick way to apply the nail polish is to use a fairly big brush, and then use flesh-colored nail polish to cover up any places that turned out messy. (B) Tape the cuticles with any kind of tape that has been cut to fit snugly around the nail. Then go ahead and paint the nails. Remove the tape and if you still got nail polish on your cuticle or fingers, dip a q-tip in nail polish remover and wipe the excess away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tape the cuticles with any kind of tape that has been cut to fit snugly around the nail. Then go ahead and paint the nails. Remove the tape and if you still got nail polish on your cuticle or fingers, dip a q-tip in nail polish remover and wipe the excess away.\nExplanation: This method ensures that the nail polish is applied neatly and precisely without getting on the cuticles or skin around the nails. The tape acts as a barrier and can easily be removed once the nail polish is dry.

Remove with tongs, or drain in a colander, and immediately transfer to ice water for 1 minute to stop the cooking process.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer as asparagus only needs to be boiled for 3 to 4 minutes to become tender. Boiling it for 34 minutes, as stated in option A, would result in overcooked and mushy asparagus. The step of immediately transferring the asparagus to ice water to stop the cooking process is also important to ensure that the asparagus retains its bright green color and crisp texture."}}
{"Q": "How to ensure the rice for a horchata drink has a smoky flavor?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Before blending the rice with the milk and spices, toast the rice on low heat in a pan for a few moments until browned (B) After blending the rice with the milk and spices, toast the rice on low heat in a pan for a few moments until browned", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Before blending the rice with the milk and spices, toast the rice on low heat in a pan for a few moments until browned.\nExplanation: Toasting the rice before blending it with the milk and spices will allow the rice to absorb the smoky flavor from the toasting process. This will result in a more pronounced smoky flavor in the horchata drink. Toasting the rice after blending it with the milk and spices may not have the same effect as the rice may not be able to absorb the smoky flavor as effectively."}}
{"Q": "Use healthy sandwich alternative for mayo.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use smashed avocado. (B) Use peanut butter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Use smashed avocado.\nExplanation: Smashed avocado is a healthier alternative to mayo as it is rich in healthy fats, fiber, and vitamins. It also adds a creamy texture to the sandwich, making it a great substitute for mayo. Peanut butter, on the other hand, is high in calories and fat, and may not be suitable for those with nut allergies.

Purchase your tank and add the fish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is important to choose the right fish for your tank based on their size and behavior. By deciding what kind of fish you would like to have and researching their growth size, you can purchase a tank that will accommodate their needs. This will ensure that your fish have enough space to swim and thrive, and prevent overcrowding which can lead to health problems and stress. Choosing a tank based on its size alone without considering the needs of the fish can result in a poor living environment for them."}}
{"Q": "How can I keep my garbage disposal blades sharp and in good repair?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Once a month add 6 metal washers into your disposal and turn it on and wash it away, this will sharpen and clean the garbage disposal. (B) Once a month add 6 ice cubes into your disposal and turn it on and wash it away, this will sharpen and clean the garbage disposal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Once a month add 6 ice cubes into your disposal and turn it on and wash it away, this will sharpen and clean the garbage disposal.\nExplanation: Adding ice cubes to your garbage disposal helps to sharpen the blades and clean the unit. As the ice cubes are ground up, they help to remove any buildup or debris on the blades, which can help to keep them sharp and in good repair.

{"Q": "How can I fix a nail polish smudge?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rub a cotton swab dampened with nail polish remover over it. (B) Rub a cotton swab dampened with water over it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Rub a cotton swab dampened with nail polish remover over it.\nExplanation: Nail polish remover contains acetone which can dissolve the smudged polish and allow it to be wiped away. Water alone will not be effective in removing the smudge. However, it is important to be careful when using nail polish remover as it can also dissolve and remove the surrounding polish if too much is applied or if it is rubbed too vigorously."}}

{"Q": "filters", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can be used to  produce radio signal (B) can be used to  block radio signal", "R": {"text": "Answer: Both A and B are plausible answers depending on the type of filter and its specific application. \n\nExplanation: Filters are devices that allow certain frequencies to pass through while blocking others. This property can be used to produce radio signals by allowing only the desired frequency to pass through and blocking all others. On the other hand, filters can also be used to block radio signals by allowing only certain frequencies to pass through and blocking all others. The specific type of filter and its application will determine whether it is used to produce or block radio signals."}}
{"Q": "Yarn-Wrapped Painted Jars", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wrap some yarn or twine around a jar, smash it, and peel the yarn away once it’s dry: you’ll be left with a gorgeous luminary for tea lights or candles. (B) Wrap some yarn or twine around a jar, paint it, and peel the yarn away once it’s dry: you’ll be left with a gorgeous luminary for tea lights or candles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Wrap some yarn or twine around a jar, paint it, and peel the yarn away once it’s dry: you’ll be left with a gorgeous luminary for tea lights or candles.\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because wrapping yarn or twine around a jar and then painting it is a common DIY project. The yarn or twine creates a pattern on the jar, and once the paint is dry, the yarn can be peeled away to reveal the design. This creates a beautiful luminary that can be used with tea lights or candles. Option A, on the other hand, involves smashing the jar, which is not only dangerous but also unlikely to result in a usable luminary."}}

Sweeping may only remove surface-level debris and may not be as thorough. Additionally, vacuuming can also help remove any pet hair or other allergens that may be present on the couch."}}
{"Q": "How can I tell if my apples are genetically grown (or altered)", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The 5 numbers on the label will begin with the number 8. (B) The 5 Web addresses on the label will begin with the number 911.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The 5 numbers on the label will begin with the number 8.\nExplanation: Genetically modified apples are labeled with a five-digit number that begins with the number 8. This labeling system is voluntary, but many companies choose to use it to inform consumers about the genetic modification of their products. Therefore, if the label on your apples has a five-digit number that begins with the number 8, it is likely that they are genetically modified."}}
{"Q": "What tools do you need to make a suncatcher?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) You need tape, a CD, a printed design, and tape. (B) You need tape, a CD, a printed design, and a VHS tape.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: To make a suncatcher, you typically need a transparent or translucent material to act as the \"catcher\" of the sunlight, such as a CD or a piece of clear plastic. You also need a design to place behind the transparent material, which can be printed on paper or drawn by hand. Tape may be used to secure the design to the transparent material or to hang the suncatcher. A VHS tape is not typically used in making a suncatcher, making option A the more plausible answer."}}

Additionally, decorating the outside of the box with colorful ornaments will make the pencil holder more visually appealing."}}
{"Q": "What do you need to shape the macarons?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) You will need a piping bag with any size tip. (B) You will need a piping bag with a large round tip.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. You will need a piping bag with any size tip.\nExplanation: Macarons are typically shaped using a piping bag, which allows for precise placement of the batter onto the baking sheet. While a large round tip may be used, any size tip can be used depending on the desired size and shape of the macarons. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it allows for more flexibility in shaping the macarons."}}
{"Q": "Make pickled eggs.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Soak eggs in coconut oil for one week. (B) Soak eggs in vinegar for one week.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Soak eggs in vinegar for one week.\nExplanation: Pickled eggs are typically made by soaking hard-boiled eggs in a vinegar-based solution for several days to a week. Coconut oil is not commonly used in pickling and would not provide the necessary acidity to preserve the eggs. Vinegar, on the other hand, is a common pickling agent and would provide the necessary acidity to create pickled eggs."}}
{"Q": "Make a toy for baby.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Give him a box filled with plastic utensils and tumblers and measuring cups. (B) Put some items inside a small sized butter container and let him shake it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Give him a box filled with plastic utensils and tumblers and measuring cups.\nExplanation: This option provides a variety of items for the baby to explore and play with, promoting sensory development and hand-eye coordination. The different shapes and sizes of the utensils and cups also encourage problem-solving and spatial awareness. Additionally, the box itself can be used for imaginative play and as a storage container for the toys. The butter container option may not provide as much variety or stimulation for the baby."}}
{"Q": "How do you kick a soccer ball?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use the side or toe of your foot. (B) Use the toe or ball of your foot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Use the side or toe of your foot.\nExplanation: Using the side or toe of your foot provides more surface area to make contact with the ball, allowing for greater control and power. Kicking with the toe or ball of your foot can result in less accuracy and control, and may also increase the risk of injury."}}
{"Q": "how do you marinade meat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) put seasoning all over it. (B) put your meat in a tupperware container and put barbecue sauce all in it, and stir it around.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Put your meat in a marinade mixture and let it sit for a period of time.\nExplanation: To properly marinade meat, you should create a mixture of ingredients such as oil, vinegar, herbs, spices, and/or acid (like citrus juice) and let the meat sit in it for a period of time, usually a few hours or overnight. This allows the flavors to penetrate the meat and tenderize it. Simply putting seasoning all over it or putting barbecue sauce in a container and stirring it around may add some flavor, but it won't fully penetrate the meat and tenderize it like a proper marinade will."}}
{"Q": "How can you hold drawers together while the glue dries?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use tape to hold the drawers together. (B) Use wood to hold the drawers together.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Use tape to hold the drawers together.\nExplanation: Using tape to hold the drawers together is a more plausible answer as it is a common method used in woodworking. The tape can be applied tightly around the drawers to hold them in place while the glue dries. Wood may not be a practical option as it would require additional materials and tools to create a clamping system."}}
{"Q": "how do you cure a dry face?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) put water over it. (B) use a humidifier in the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Use a humidifier in the house.\nExplanation: A dry face is often caused by low humidity levels in the air, which can be remedied by using a humidifier in the house. Simply putting water over the face may provide temporary relief, but it will not address the underlying cause of the dryness. A humidifier adds moisture to the air, which can help keep the skin hydrated and prevent dryness."}}
{"Q": "How much salt should be added to a brine for smoking food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Add 2 cups of salt for every 1/2 quart of water. (B) Add 1/2 cup of salt for every 2 quarts of water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Add 1/2 cup of salt for every 2 quarts of water.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it follows the general rule of using 1 cup of salt for every gallon of water when making a brine. 2 quarts of water is half a gallon, so using 1/2 cup of salt would be appropriate. Adding 2 cups of salt for every 1/2 quart of water would result in an extremely salty brine and could ruin the flavor of the food being smoked."}}
{"Q": "To dig a hole to begin a garden, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place a crowbar in the dirt and scoop the dirt into a pile nearby until you have a hole (B) Place a shovel in the dirt and scoop the dirt into a pile nearby until you have a hole", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Place a shovel in the dirt and scoop the dirt into a pile nearby until you have a hole.\nExplanation: Using a shovel is a more common and practical tool for digging a hole for a garden. A crowbar is typically used for breaking up hard soil or rocks, but it would not be efficient for digging a hole. A shovel allows for easier scooping and removal of dirt, making it the more plausible choice for this task."}}
{"Q": "how do you spike a ball?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) throw it with your hand into the air. (B) hit it with the palm of your hand, into the air.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) hit it with the palm of your hand, into the air.\nExplanation: To spike a ball in volleyball, you need to hit it with force using the palm of your hand, sending it over the net and towards the ground on the opponent's side. Throwing the ball with your hand into the air would not generate enough force to spike it, and it would not be considered a legal move in volleyball."}}
{"Q": "How can I get the marker stain out of my t shirt?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Run it under cold water with a bar of soap. Then use stain remover on it before putting it in the laundry machine. (B) Run it under cold water with a bar of soap. Then use stain remover on it before putting it in the dryer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Run it under cold water with a bar of soap. Then use stain remover on it before putting it in the laundry machine.\nExplanation: Running the stained area under cold water with a bar of soap can help loosen the marker stain. Using a stain remover before putting it in the laundry machine can also help remove the stain completely. Putting the shirt in the dryer before treating the stain may set the stain and make it harder to remove."}}
{"Q": "chip clip", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can poke a hole in a slow cooker with pressure applied (B) can poke a hole in a paper cup with pressure applied", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a chip clip could poke a hole in a paper cup with pressure applied, as paper cups are not as sturdy as slow cookers and are more likely to be punctured by a small object like a chip clip."}}
{"Q": "How long do you need to wait until the glue gun heats up?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Give the gun 3 minutes to cool down up, and then squeeze the trigger to check if the glue is flowing. (B) Give the gun 3 minutes to warm up, and then squeeze the trigger to check if the glue is flowing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Give the gun 3 minutes to warm up, and then squeeze the trigger to check if the glue is flowing.\nExplanation: Glue guns typically take a few minutes to heat up before they are ready to use. Option B suggests waiting for the gun to warm up for 3 minutes, which is a reasonable amount of time for most glue guns. Option A suggests waiting for the gun to cool down, which is not necessary before using it. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "heater", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) warming boat easily (B) warming backyard easily", "R": {"text": "Answer: Warming backyard easily.\nExplanation: It is more plausible to warm a backyard easily than a boat, as boats are typically exposed to the elements and require specialized heating systems. A backyard can be easily warmed with outdoor heaters, fire pits, or even blankets and hot drinks."}}
{"Q": "Once you have put melted HDPE plastic in a mold what should you do next?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Since the plastic will shrink as it cools be sure to clamp the mold and adjust the tightness every 5 mins. (B) Once the plastic has cooled sufficiently wrap a heavy duty rubber band around the mold for at least 5 mins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: HDPE plastic will shrink as it cools, so it is important to clamp the mold and adjust the tightness every 5 minutes to ensure that the final product is the desired size and shape. Wrapping a rubber band around the mold will not provide enough pressure to prevent shrinkage and may result in a misshapen or distorted final product."}}
{"Q": "Create a wonderful Fried Chicken dish from scratch.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cut your chicken and soak it in mixed eggs then coat with bread crumbs and put it in the fryer. (B) Drive to your local KFC or Church's chicken and buy a tub of your favorite Fried Chicken.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Cut your chicken and soak it in mixed eggs then coat with bread crumbs and put it in the fryer.\nExplanation: This option involves making the Fried Chicken dish from scratch, which is the purpose of the question. Soaking the chicken in mixed eggs will help the bread crumbs stick to the chicken and create a crispy coating when fried. This method also allows for customization of the seasoning and breading, making it a more personalized and delicious dish. Buying pre-made Fried Chicken from a fast-food chain may be convenient, but it does not offer the same level of satisfaction as making it from scratch."}}
{"Q": "How do you sharpen a knife?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) If you find yourself with a dull knife but without a knife sharpener, you can use the unglazed bottom of a ceramic mug to sharpen small knives. Applying moderate pressure, hold the knife at a 15-degree angle and carefully draw the entire length of the blade across the rough surface. (B) If you find yourself with a dull knife but without a knife sharpener, you can use the unglazed bottom of a ceramic mug to sharpen large knives. Applying moderate pressure, hold the knife at a 15-degree angle and carefully draw the entire length of the blade across the rough surface.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Using the unglazed bottom of a ceramic mug to sharpen a small knife is a common and effective method. However, using it to sharpen a large knife may not be as effective as it requires more pressure and may not provide enough surface area to sharpen the entire length of the blade. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How can I keep a basement from smelling like mildew?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Keep a bag of barbeque charcoal in the basement. (B) Keep a bag of activated charcoal in the basement.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Keep a bag of activated charcoal in the basement.\nExplanation: Activated charcoal is known for its ability to absorb moisture and odors, making it an effective solution for preventing mildew smells in a basement. It works by trapping the moisture and odor particles in its porous surface, preventing them from circulating in the air. Barbeque charcoal may also absorb some odors, but it is not as effective as activated charcoal and may even release harmful chemicals into the air. Therefore, keeping a bag of activated charcoal in the basement is a more plausible and safer solution."}}
{"Q": "how do you suck on something?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) chew on it with your gums (B) slurp it with your tongue and gums", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) slurp it with your tongue and gums\nExplanation: When you suck on something, you create a vacuum in your mouth by closing your lips around the object and drawing in air. This action is typically accompanied by using your tongue and gums to create suction and draw the object into your mouth. Chewing on something with your gums would not create the necessary suction to suck on something."}}
{"Q": "To hold metal still while you're cutting it, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place the metal in a box to keep it from moving (B) Place the metal in a clamp to keep it from moving", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Place the metal in a clamp to keep it from moving.\nExplanation: Placing the metal in a clamp is a common and effective method to hold it still while cutting. The clamp can be adjusted to hold the metal securely in place, allowing for precise cuts without the risk of the metal shifting or moving. Placing the metal in a box may not be practical or effective, as the metal may still move around inside the box."}}
{"Q": "how do you check if chicken is cooked?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) make sure the outside isn't pink. (B) make sure the inside isn't pink.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) make sure the inside isn't pink.\nExplanation: While the outside color of chicken can be an indicator of doneness, it is not always reliable. The best way to check if chicken is cooked is to use a meat thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature has reached at least 165°F (74°C) throughout the thickest part of the meat. This will ensure that any harmful bacteria have been destroyed and the chicken is safe to eat. Simply cutting into the chicken to check for pinkness can be misleading, as some parts of the meat may still be undercooked even if the surface appears fully cooked."}}
{"Q": "how to remove a tick", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) You really don' t need to remove it, eventually it will fall off itself that way you don't have to worry about the head being left behind.  After it falls off, then cleanse area where it fell from and flush the tick down the toilet. (B) Get your tweezers right down on your skin so you can grab as close as possible to the tick's head and pull up slow and firm to remove tick. Then cleanse area where you removed it from and flush the tick down the toilet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the correct answer as it provides the proper method for removing a tick. It is important to remove the tick as soon as possible to reduce the risk of disease transmission. Using tweezers, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible and pull it out slowly and firmly. After removal, cleanse the area with soap and water or rubbing alcohol. It is also recommended to save the tick in a sealed container in case it needs to be tested for disease. Flushing the tick down the toilet is not recommended as it may survive and continue to pose a risk."}}
{"Q": "How can you decorate an old shirt to give it new life?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Old shirts can be given new life by using fabric paint or markers to add designs, or even slogans. (B) Old shirts can be given new life by using automotive paint or markers to add designs, or even slogans.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Old shirts can be given new life by using fabric paint or markers to add designs, or even slogans.\nExplanation: Fabric paint or markers are specifically designed for use on fabric and will adhere better than automotive paint or markers. They also come in a variety of colors and finishes, allowing for more creative options. Additionally, fabric paint or markers are washable and won't fade or crack over time like automotive paint or markers might."}}
{"Q": "how do you fill up a bag?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) place items in it until you want to close it. (B) place items in it until they reach the top.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Filling up a bag until you want to close it is a more practical and realistic approach. If you fill up a bag until it reaches the top, it may become too heavy or difficult to carry, and items may fall out. Additionally, some bags may have a weight limit or may not be able to hold as much as others, so filling it until you want to close it ensures that you are not overloading the bag."}}
{"Q": "floss", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can be fastened to a wall by marker  (B) can be fastened to a wall by pin ", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) can be fastened to a wall by pin.\nExplanation: Floss is a thin and lightweight material, making it more plausible to be fastened to a wall by a pin rather than a marker. A marker would be too heavy and bulky to hold the floss securely in place, while a pin can easily pierce through the floss and hold it against the wall."}}
{"Q": "Make a mini hiking kit.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Store small items in empty soup tin. (B) Store small items in empty mint tin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Store small items in empty mint tin.\nExplanation: An empty mint tin is a more practical choice for a mini hiking kit as it is smaller and more compact than an empty soup tin. It can easily fit in a backpack or pocket without taking up too much space. Additionally, mint tins often have a hinged lid that securely closes, preventing items from falling out during the hike."}}
{"Q": "how do you walk?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) move around on your feet. (B) move around on your hands and knees.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. move around on your feet.\nExplanation: Walking is a common form of locomotion for humans and involves moving around on two feet. While crawling on hands and knees is also a form of movement, it is not typically referred to as walking. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How to start a fire in a fireplace at home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Stack the wood as desired, then place newspaper or tinder between the wood and press a lighter to the tinder until it catches and then the wood catches (B) Stack the wood as desired, then place newspaper or tinder between the wood and press a lighter to the wood until it catches and then the tinder catches", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Stack the wood as desired, then place newspaper or tinder between the wood and press a lighter to the tinder until it catches and then the wood catches.\n\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer because placing the tinder between the wood allows for better airflow and helps the fire to catch more easily. Additionally, lighting the tinder first allows it to burn for a bit before the wood catches, which helps to establish a stronger fire. It is important to make sure the fireplace flue is open and that there is no debris or obstructions in the chimney before starting a fire. Always use caution when starting a fire and never leave it unattended."}}
{"Q": "To allow yourself to make edits, while writing by hand.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use a pencil, instead of a pen, so you can erase any mistakes. (B) Use a pen, instead of a pencil, so you can erase any mistakes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Use a pencil, instead of a pen, so you can erase any mistakes.\nExplanation: Using a pencil allows for easy erasing and editing while writing by hand. If a mistake is made, it can be quickly corrected without having to cross out or start over. Using a pen, on the other hand, makes it difficult to make changes without it being noticeable or messy. Therefore, using a pencil is a more plausible answer for allowing oneself to make edits while writing by hand."}}
{"Q": "To easily thread rope through a bag to act as a drawstring.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Attach a safety pin to one end and pull through the tube in the fabric. (B) Tie a knot to one end and slide through the tube in the fabric.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Attach a safety pin to one end and pull through the tube in the fabric.\nExplanation: Attaching a safety pin to one end of the rope makes it easier to pull through the tube in the fabric. The pin can easily slide through the tube, and the rope can be pulled along with it. Tying a knot to one end may make it difficult to slide through the tube, and may even get stuck, making it harder to thread the rope through the bag."}}
{"Q": "Concrete", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) seals chimney  (B) seals soil ", "R": {"text": "Answer: Seals soil\nExplanation: Sealing soil is a more plausible answer as it could refer to a process of preventing soil erosion or preventing water from seeping into the soil. Sealing a chimney, on the other hand, is not a common practice and may not make sense in most contexts."}}
{"Q": "How to get to sleep quickly", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Take a melatonin chewy and then go to bed when you're tired. (B) Build a special room with no windows and no tech type of lights, indicator lights etc. Take a nice shower, take magnesium glycinate 2x a day and sleep like a baby!", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Take a melatonin chewy and then go to bed when you're tired.\nExplanation: Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles. Taking a melatonin chewy can help signal to your body that it's time to sleep. It's important to wait until you're actually feeling tired before going to bed, as trying to force yourself to sleep can actually make it harder to fall asleep. This option is also more practical and accessible than building a special room with no windows and no tech type of lights."}}
{"Q": "how do you terminate something?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) give it a time limit. (B) stop it from existing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) stop it from existing.\nExplanation: To terminate something means to bring it to an end or to stop it completely. Giving it a time limit may only delay the termination, but it will not completely stop it. Therefore, the more plausible answer is to stop it from existing altogether."}}
{"Q": "How do I attached a rubber foot to wood?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Buy a pack of rubber feet and just set them on without glue. (B) Buy a pack of rubber feet that come with sticky backs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Buy a pack of rubber feet that come with sticky backs.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it provides a secure and easy way to attach the rubber feet to the wood without the need for additional tools or materials. The sticky backs will adhere to the wood surface and keep the rubber feet in place. This method is also less likely to damage the wood compared to using glue or other adhesives."}}
{"Q": "Organize restaurant delivery menus.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mount a cap holder to wall or inside door. (B) Mount a brochure holder to wall or inside door.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Mount a brochure holder to wall or inside door.\nExplanation: A brochure holder is more suitable for organizing restaurant delivery menus as it allows for easy access and visibility of the menus. It also keeps the menus neat and organized, preventing them from getting lost or damaged. A cap holder may not be as effective as it is designed for holding caps and may not be able to accommodate larger menus."}}
{"Q": "To use tights that have been ruined by a run,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) add some other runs and tears to give it a stylish effect. (B) glue the edges of the run together with fabric glue.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Glue the edges of the run together with fabric glue.\nExplanation: Adding more runs and tears to the tights would only make them look more damaged and less wearable. Gluing the edges of the run together with fabric glue can help prevent the run from getting worse and extend the life of the tights. However, it may not completely hide the run and may not be a permanent solution."}}
{"Q": "how do I peel garlic without a kinfe", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Break the head into cloves.    Put the cloves into a sealable hard-sided container much smaller than all of the garlic together.    Shake  it for about 15-30 seconds. ...    If cloves are still difficult to release, shake longer and more vigorously.    Repeat for the remaining bulbs. (B) Break the head into cloves.    Put the cloves into a sealable hard-sided container much larger (10x or more) than the garlic.    Shake  it for about 15-30 seconds. ...    If cloves are still difficult to release, shake longer and more vigorously.    Repeat for the remaining bulbs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \n\nExplanation: Breaking the head of garlic into cloves and shaking them in a small, sealable container is a common method for peeling garlic without a knife. The shaking action helps to loosen the skin from the cloves, making them easier to peel. Using a container that is smaller than the garlic allows for more vigorous shaking, which can help to release the cloves from their skins. Using a larger container may not provide enough friction to effectively peel the garlic."}}
{"Q": "how do you prepare for surgery?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) eat only two meals in the 24 hours prior. (B) don't eat anything for 24 hours prior", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) don't eat anything for 24 hours prior.\nExplanation: Fasting for at least 6-8 hours before surgery is typically recommended to reduce the risk of aspiration (inhaling stomach contents into the lungs) during anesthesia. However, some surgeries may require a longer fasting period of up to 24 hours. Eating only two meals in the 24 hours prior to surgery (option A) may not provide enough time for the body to fully digest the food, increasing the risk of aspiration. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. It is important to follow the specific fasting instructions provided by the surgeon or anesthesiologist to ensure a safe and successful surgery."}}
{"Q": "Dye lace with koolaid.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Put lace in container with warm water.  Add koolaid and move lace around until it's the desired color.  Take lace out, rinse in warm water, and let dry. (B) Put lace in container with koolaid.  Distribute koolaid evenly around lace until it's the desired color.  Take lace out, rinse in warm water, and let dry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because warm water helps to dissolve the koolaid powder and distribute the color evenly throughout the lace. Moving the lace around in the water also helps to ensure that the color is evenly distributed. Option B may result in uneven coloring as the koolaid may not dissolve evenly in the water and may not reach all parts of the lace."}}
{"Q": "how to increase shelf life of nuts?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) place them outside in the sun for several days (B) put them in the freezer", "R": {"text": "Answer: Put them in the freezer.\nExplanation: Freezing nuts can significantly increase their shelf life by preventing the growth of bacteria and mold. It also helps to preserve their flavor and texture. On the other hand, placing them outside in the sun can actually speed up the process of spoilage due to exposure to heat and moisture."}}

{"Q": "To feel more comfortable when out in public,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) dress like you want to be successful when you go out. (B) dress like you do not care about your surroundings.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Dress like you want to be successful when you go out.\nExplanation: When you dress well, you feel more confident and comfortable in your own skin. It also sends a message to others that you take yourself seriously and are ready to tackle any situation. Dressing like you do not care about your surroundings may make you feel more relaxed, but it can also give off the impression that you are not taking the situation seriously or that you do not care about your appearance. Therefore, dressing like you want to be successful is a more plausible answer to feeling more comfortable in public."}}
{"Q": "How can I make a bed for a small dog?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a plastic shopping bag and stuff it with old socks. (B) Use an old pillowcase and stuff it with old socks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Use an old pillowcase and stuff it with old socks.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because a pillowcase is a soft and durable material that can be easily stuffed with old socks to create a comfortable bed for a small dog.

{"Q": "What is the best way to feel at least a bit happier every day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The best way to feel a little bit better even if you are really down is to help somebody. If you help somebody in any way, no matter how big or small, you will feel better, it is guaranteed. (B) The best way to feel a little bit better even if you are really down is to snub somebody. If you snub somebody in any way, no matter how big or small, you will feel better than them, it is guaranteed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The best way to feel a little bit better even if you are really down is to help somebody. \nExplanation: Helping others has been shown to increase feelings of happiness and well-being. It can also give a sense of purpose and meaning in life. On the other hand, snubbing somebody can lead to negative feelings and potentially harm relationships. Therefore, helping somebody is a more plausible and positive way to feel happier every day."}}
{"Q": "cave", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) keeps the boulders contained (B) keeps the mountain contained", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: A cave is typically a natural formation in the earth that is formed by erosion or other geological processes. It is unlikely that a cave would be able to contain an entire mountain, as mountains are much larger and more massive than caves. However, it is possible for a cave to contain boulders or rocks that have fallen from the surrounding area, which could be the purpose of the cave mentioned in the question."}}
{"Q": "How do you make glow water?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Get a bottle of Mountain Dew and pour it into a glass till 1/4th of soda is left.

Baking powder, on the other hand, contains baking soda and other ingredients like cream of tartar and cornstarch, which may not react in the same way as baking soda alone. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How to make garlic bread.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Spread butter onto bread and sprinkle garlic powder, then bake in microwave. (B) Spread butter onto bread and sprinkle garlic powder, then bake in oven.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Spread butter onto bread and sprinkle garlic powder, then bake in oven.\nExplanation: Garlic bread is typically made by spreading butter onto bread, sprinkling garlic powder or minced garlic on top, and then baking it in the oven until the bread is crispy and the butter is melted. Using a microwave may not result in the same crispy texture and may not evenly distribute the garlic flavor. Therefore, baking in the oven is a more plausible option for making garlic bread."}}
{"Q": "tissues", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) wiping  noses cleanly (B) wiping  hands cleanly", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. wiping noses cleanly\nExplanation: Tissues are commonly used for wiping noses cleanly, especially during cold and flu season.

{"Q": "How do you find the area of a triangle?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) To find the area of a triangle, subtract the base by the height, and then divide by 2. The division by 2 comes from the fact that a parallelogram can be divided into 2 triangles. For example, in the diagram to the left, the area of each triangle is equal to one-half the area of the parallelogram. (B) To find the area of a triangle, multiply the base by the height, and then divide by 2. The division by 2 comes from the fact that a parallelogram can be divided into 2 triangles. For example, in the diagram to the left, the area of each triangle is equal to one-half the area of the parallelogram.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: To find the area of a triangle, you need to multiply the base by the height and then divide by 2. This is because the area of a parallelogram is equal to the base times the height, and since a triangle is half of a parallelogram, you need to divide by 2 to get the area of the triangle. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "Deadhead flowers", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) When the flower is brown and drooping, cut above the flower with a sharp knife. (B) When the flower is brown and drooping, cut below the flower with a sharp knife.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. When the flower is brown and drooping, cut above the flower with a sharp knife.\nExplanation: Deadheading is the process of removing spent flowers from a plant to encourage more blooms and prevent the plant from putting energy into producing seeds. Cutting above the flower with a sharp knife ensures that the stem is cleanly cut and does not damage the rest of the plant. Cutting below the flower may leave a stub that can attract pests and diseases."}}
{"Q": "binder clip", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) wash socks  (B) keep socks up", "R": {"text": "Answer: keep socks up\nExplanation: A binder clip can be used to clip the top of socks to the bottom of pants or shorts to keep them from falling down or bunching up.

{"Q": "Restore dull wicker furniture.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Spray with one layer of spray paint. (B) Spray with one layer of hair spray.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Neither option is a good solution for restoring dull wicker furniture. \n\nExplanation: \n\n(A) Spray painting wicker furniture can actually cause the material to become stiff and brittle, leading to cracking and breakage over time. Additionally, spray paint may not adhere well to the wicker material, resulting in a patchy and uneven finish. \n\n(B) Hair spray is not a suitable solution for restoring wicker furniture either. While it may add a temporary shine to the surface, it will not provide any long-term protection or restoration benefits. In fact, hair spray may attract dust and dirt, making the furniture look even duller over time. \n\nA better solution for restoring dull wicker furniture would be to clean it thoroughly with a mild soap and water solution, and then apply a protective coating of clear varnish or lacquer. This will help to seal the surface and protect it from further damage, while also enhancing its natural shine and color."}}
{"Q": "Remove algae from garden paths.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Apply bleach and scrub off. (B) Apply club soda and scrub off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Apply club soda and scrub off.\nExplanation: Bleach can be harmful to plants and the environment, and may discolor or damage the surface of the garden path.

The instructions for wrapping and insulating the snails are also included, making it a comprehensive and practical answer."}}
{"Q": "To make a bong out of a soda bottle,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) put the weed inside and heat up the entire bottle. (B) drill a hole into the bottom and insert a down stem.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) drill a hole into the bottom and insert a down stem.\nExplanation: Option (B) is the more plausible answer because it involves creating a proper airway for the smoke to travel through, which is essential for a functional bong. Heating up the entire bottle in option (A) could potentially release harmful chemicals from the plastic and is not a safe or effective method for creating a bong. By drilling a hole into the bottom and inserting a down stem, the user can create a pathway for the smoke to travel through and be filtered by water, resulting in a smoother smoking experience."}}
{"Q": "how do you share your location on the facebook app?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) open the app, and click add a post and type where you are and click post. (B) open the app, and click on the check in link and click post.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) open the app, and click on the check in link and click post.\nExplanation: To share your location on the Facebook app, you need to click on the check-in link, which is usually located at the top of the app's home screen. This will allow you to select your current location or search for a specific location. Once you have selected your location, you can add a comment or tag friends before clicking on the post button to share your location with your Facebook friends. This is a more plausible answer as it specifically mentions the check-in feature, which is designed for sharing your location on Facebook."}}
{"Q": "to depress someone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) make them angry (B) make them sad", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) make them sad\nExplanation: To depress someone means to make them feel sad, hopeless, and discouraged. While anger can be a result of frustration or disappointment, it is not the primary emotion associated with depression. Therefore, making someone sad is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "To keep edges of strapping from continuing to fray inconspicuously.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Burn the edges of the strapping to seal it off. (B) Paint the edges of the strapping to seal it off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Burn the edges of the strapping to seal it off.\nExplanation: Burning the edges of the strapping will melt the fibers together, creating a seal that will prevent further fraying. Painting the edges may temporarily cover the frayed edges, but it will not prevent further fraying and may eventually peel off. Additionally, painting may add unnecessary weight to the strapping. Burning the edges is a common and effective method used in industries such as textiles and packaging."}}
{"Q": "how do you flush something?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) let it go down the sink drain with water running. (B) let it go down the toilet when you flush.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Flushing typically refers to disposing of waste by sending it down a toilet and using the force of water to move it through the plumbing system. While running water down a sink drain can help clear out some debris, it is not typically referred to as \"flushing.\""}}
{"Q": "How to quickly dry a towel?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Once the towel is washed, twist and strain it in the bathtub then dry in the dryer and hang outside afterward (B) Before the towel is washed, twist and strain it in the bathtub then dry in the dryer and hang outside afterward", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Once the towel is washed, twist and strain it in the bathtub then dry in the dryer and hang outside afterward.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because the towel has already been washed and is wet, so twisting and straining it in the bathtub will help remove excess water and speed up the drying process. Drying it in the dryer will also help remove moisture quickly, and hanging it outside afterward will allow any remaining moisture to evaporate in the sun and fresh air. Option B is not as practical because twisting and straining a dry towel will not have the same effect as doing it when the towel is wet."}}
{"Q": "To become more mindful during activities,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) meditate and concentrate on everything in the present moment. (B) keep your eyes closed for better focus and then try to relax and sleep.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Meditate and concentrate on everything in the present moment.\nExplanation: Mindfulness involves being fully present and aware of your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings in the present moment. Meditation is a great way to train your mind to focus on the present and increase mindfulness. By practicing meditation and concentration, you can become more aware of your thoughts and emotions during activities and learn to stay present in the moment. Keeping your eyes closed and trying to sleep is not a helpful strategy for increasing mindfulness during activities."}}
{"Q": "strainer", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can go in colander  (B) can go in pick ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: A strainer is typically used to separate solids from liquids, such as when draining pasta or washing vegetables. A colander is a type of strainer that is specifically designed for this purpose, with holes or perforations that allow water to drain through while keeping the solids inside. Therefore, it is more plausible that a strainer can go in a colander than in a pick, which is not typically used for straining or separating solids and liquids."}}
{"Q": "how do you use the depo birth control shot?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) it is injected into your stomach once every three months. (B) it is injected into your arm once every three months.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) it is injected into your arm once every three months.\nExplanation: The depo birth control shot is typically injected into the upper arm or buttocks once every three months.

Combine a tablespoon of coconut oil with one drop of lemon essential oil and one drop of lavender oil. Apply the mixture to your lash line each night with a Q-tip and dab away any excess moisture with a tissue.\nExplanation: Coconut oil is known for its moisturizing properties and can help nourish the lashes. Lemon essential oil can help stimulate hair growth, while lavender oil can help soothe and calm the skin. Applying the mixture to the lash line with a Q-tip ensures precise application and dabbing away excess moisture with a tissue prevents any irritation or discomfort. Applying the mixture to the lip line would not promote lash growth and could potentially cause irritation to the lips."}}
{"Q": "How to start a small flame without wood or a candle?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place a small bottle of hand sanitizer on a metal tray and set a match to it (B) Spray a small amount of hand sanitizer on a metal tray and set a match to it", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Spray a small amount of hand sanitizer on a metal tray and set a match to it.\nExplanation: Hand sanitizer contains alcohol which is flammable.

{"Q": "mop", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) has a blade  (B) has a long handle ", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) has a long handle\nExplanation: A mop is typically used for cleaning floors and requires a long handle to reach the floor without having to bend down. While some mops may have a blade for scraping tough stains, it is not a common feature and not necessary for the basic function of a mop. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How to make the potion have a pink glare to it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use a combination of boiled beets and the residual water and add that to the potion (B) Use a combination of pink coloring and water and add that to the potion mixture", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Use a combination of boiled beets and the residual water and add that to the potion.\nExplanation: Beets are known for their natural pink color, and boiling them can extract the color into the water. By adding this to the potion, it will give it a natural pink glare without the need for artificial coloring. This method is also more plausible as it uses natural ingredients that are commonly found in a kitchen, rather than relying on artificial coloring which may not be readily available or safe for consumption."}}
{"Q": "how do you stir liquid?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) use a big spoon and rotate it around the container. (B) use a big straw and rotate it around the container.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. use a big spoon and rotate it around the container.\nExplanation: Using a big spoon to stir liquid is a common and practical method. It allows for better control and mixing of the liquid compared to using a straw. A straw may not be able to handle thicker liquids and may not be as effective in stirring."}}
{"Q": "How do you write with a pencil?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Take the pencil in your hand, and find a writing surface. Place the back end of the pencil onto the surface. Apply gentle pressure and move the pencil across the surface. (B) Take the pencil in your hand, and find a writing surface. Place the writing end of the pencil onto the surface. Apply gentle pressure and move the pencil across the surface.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: The writing end of the pencil is the part that contains the graphite lead, which is what actually makes the marks on the writing surface. Therefore, it is necessary to place the writing end of the pencil onto the surface in order to write with it. Placing the back end of the pencil onto the surface would not produce any marks."}}
{"Q": "Increase smoothness of hair.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Soak hair in brewed coffee before shower. (B) Soak hair in brewed tea before shower.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Soak hair in brewed tea before shower.\nExplanation: Tea contains antioxidants and caffeine which can help to stimulate hair growth and improve the overall health of hair. It also contains tannins which can help to smooth the hair cuticle, making it appear shinier and smoother. On the other hand, coffee can be too harsh for the hair and may cause dryness and damage. Therefore, soaking hair in brewed tea before shower is a more plausible option to increase smoothness of hair."}}

(B) Use 2 old belts, loop each and string one or 2 boards between the belts, nail the boards to the belts so they are even and vertical.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Use 2 old belts, loop each and string one or 2 boards between the belts, nail the boards to the belts so they are even and horizontal.\nExplanation: This option seems more plausible because hanging the shelf horizontally will provide more stability and support for the items placed on it. Additionally, using belts as the hanging mechanism adds a unique and stylish touch to the shelf."}}
{"Q": "To decorate a lemon cake naturally,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) top it with blueberries. (B) top it with sprinkles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Top it with blueberries.\nExplanation: Blueberries are a natural complement to lemon flavor and their vibrant color adds a pop of visual interest to the cake. Sprinkles, on the other hand, are not a natural pairing with lemon and may detract from the overall flavor profile of the cake."}}
{"Q": "How can I lose more weight?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Don't drink any water 4 hours before bedtime, it will help reduce calories. (B) Don't eat anything 4 hours before bedtime, it will help reduce calories.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Don't eat anything 4 hours before bedtime, it will help reduce calories.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is a well-known fact that consuming calories close to bedtime can lead to weight gain. By not eating anything 4 hours before bedtime, you are giving your body enough time to digest the food and burn the calories before going to sleep. Additionally, it is important to note that drinking water is essential for weight loss and overall health, so avoiding water before bedtime is not a healthy or effective weight loss strategy."}}
{"Q": "To pry a nail out of a board,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) use the claw end of the hammer to grasp the nail, then use the hammer handle as a lever to pry it out. (B) use the fblunt end of the hammer to grasp the nail, then use the hammer handle as a lever to pry it out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Using the claw end of the hammer to grasp the nail provides a better grip and leverage to pry it out. The blunt end of the hammer may not be able to grip the nail securely, making it difficult to remove. Additionally, the claw end is specifically designed for this purpose, making it the more plausible option."}}
{"Q": "How to paint a wall", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a paint stick to cover more surface evenly (B) Use a paint roller to cover more surface evenly", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use a paint roller to cover more surface evenly.\nExplanation: Using a paint roller is a more effective way to cover a large surface area evenly. A paint stick may be useful for stirring the paint, but it does not provide the same level of coverage as a roller. A roller also allows for a smoother finish and can save time compared to using a brush or paint stick."}}
{"Q": "how do you go home on the instagram app?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) click on your profile picture at the bottom right of any page. (B) click on the house at the bottom left of any page.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) click on the house at the bottom left of any page.\nExplanation: The house icon represents the home page on Instagram, which is the default landing page when you open the app. By clicking on the house icon, you will be redirected to the home page, where you can see posts from people you follow, explore new content, and access various features of the app. Therefore, it is more plausible to click on the house icon to go home on the Instagram app."}}
{"Q": "Mixing the ingredients", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mix the cookie crumbs, pecans, and caramel together, add the condensed milk mixing with a spatula, then roll the mixture into a log using a plastic bag. (B) Mix the cookie crumbs, pecans, and caramel together, add the condensed milk mixing with a spatula, then roll the mixture into a log using plastic wrap.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Plastic wrap is a more common and practical material for rolling the mixture into a log as it provides a tighter seal and is easier to handle than a plastic bag."}}
{"Q": "How do you talk into a mic without causing distortion.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Hold the mic close to your mouth but not touching it. (B) Hold the mic close to your lips ensure you are touching them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Hold the mic close to your mouth but not touching it.\nExplanation: Holding the mic too close to your lips can cause distortion and popping sounds, especially when pronouncing certain letters like \"p\" and \"b\". By holding the mic close to your mouth but not touching it, you can still capture clear audio without the risk of distortion. Additionally, speaking directly into the front of the mic (rather than the side or top) can also help reduce distortion."}}
{"Q": "To attach a comic panel to a piece of wood", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) You should lay the comic panel onto the wood and paint over it with modge podge. (B) You should lay the comic panel onto the wood and paint over it with paint.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Modge podge is a type of glue that can be used to attach paper to surfaces like wood. It dries clear and creates a protective layer over the paper, making it a good choice for attaching a comic panel to a piece of wood. Painting over the comic panel with modge podge will also help to seal it and prevent it from peeling or fading over time. Painting over it with regular paint may cause the paper to wrinkle or tear, and may not provide enough protection for the comic panel."}}
{"Q": "sharpen a crayon without something sharp", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dip the blunt crayon end into a bowl of hot water. Leave it for a few minutes. If you don't fancy holding it in place, tie it to a piece of string which ties onto a pencil. ...    Remove after a few minutes.    Shape the tip back again with your fingers. (B) Dip the blunt crayon end into a bowl of cold water. Leave it for a few minutes. If you don't fancy holding it in place, tie it to a piece of string which ties onto a pencil. ...    Remove after a few minutes.    Shape the tip back again with your fingers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Dip the blunt crayon end into a bowl of hot water. Leave it for a few minutes. If you don't fancy holding it in place, tie it to a piece of string which ties onto a pencil. Remove after a few minutes. Shape the tip back again with your fingers.\n\nExplanation: Hot water will soften the wax in the crayon, making it easier to shape and sharpen. Cold water will not have the same effect. Tying the crayon to a pencil will help keep it in place while it is soaking in the hot water. After removing the crayon from the water, it can be shaped back into a point using your fingers."}}
{"Q": "how do you prepare someone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) get them ready. (B) tell them what to do.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Get them ready.\nExplanation: Preparing someone involves more than just telling them what to do. It also involves getting them mentally and physically ready for the task at hand. This may involve providing them with the necessary resources, training, and support to ensure they are fully equipped to handle the situation. Simply telling someone what to do may not be enough to adequately prepare them for the task."}}
{"Q": "hot pad", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can take away nausea quickly (B) can take away stomach ache quickly", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Hot pads are commonly used to alleviate stomach aches by providing warmth and increasing blood flow to the affected area. While some people may find relief from nausea with the use of a hot pad, it is not a widely recognized or recommended treatment for this symptom. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How to attach a necklace when you've lost your clasp?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) use a paper clip to secure the two ends together (B) use a binder clip to secure the two ends together", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use a binder clip to secure the two ends together.\nExplanation: Using a paper clip may not be strong enough to hold the weight of the necklace and could easily come undone. A binder clip, on the other hand, is stronger and more secure. Simply clip the two ends of the necklace together with the binder clip and adjust the length as needed. However, it is important to note that this is a temporary solution and it is recommended to replace the lost clasp as soon as possible."}}
{"Q": "Keep Sliced Fruit From Browning", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) you can add lemon juice (B) you can add carrot juice", "R": {"text": "Answer: You can add lemon juice.\nExplanation: Lemon juice contains citric acid which helps to slow down the oxidation process that causes fruits to turn brown. It also adds a tangy flavor to the fruit. Carrot juice does not have the same effect on preventing browning as lemon juice does."}}
{"Q": "Create a filtering net.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Wrap panythose around wire coat hanger bent into a square frame. (B) Wrap newspaper around wire coat hanger bent into a square frame.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Wrap pantyhose around wire coat hanger bent into a square frame.\nExplanation: Pantyhose is made of a fine mesh material that can effectively filter out small particles. Wrapping it around a wire coat hanger bent into a square frame creates a sturdy and effective filtering net. Newspaper, on the other hand, is not a suitable material for filtering as it is not fine enough to catch small particles and would quickly become clogged."}}
{"Q": "Make the best tasting lemonade you've ever tried.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Only use fresh lemons, a dozen for a 2 litre pitcher is perfect. Use only filtered water, no chlorine etc. Using a lemon squeezer or juicer, extract the fresh juice and pour into your 2 litre pitcher along with your favorite sweetener to taste, and fill with pure water. The water is what makes this lemonade taste so good. No after taste or chemical flavours to spoil it. (B) Lemonade can be made using vinegar and sugar, if you run out of lemons. With enough sugar you can't really taste the difference. It might need some yellow food colouring to make it look \"lemony\", which is quite important because the visual impact of food can rival the impact of the taste of the food itself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Using fresh lemons and filtered water ensures that the lemonade has a pure and natural taste without any added chemicals or aftertaste. Adding your favorite sweetener to taste allows for customization and personal preference. This method prioritizes quality ingredients and simplicity, resulting in a refreshing and delicious lemonade. Option B, while it may work in a pinch, does not prioritize taste or quality ingredients and relies on artificial coloring to make up for the lack of real lemon flavor."}}
{"Q": "how do you tip someone at a bar?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) place the tip underneath your last glass. (B) give them the money in their hand.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Give them the money in their hand.\nExplanation: It is customary to give the bartender the tip directly in their hand as a sign of appreciation for their service. Placing the tip underneath your last glass may cause confusion and delay in the bartender receiving their tip."}}

Garnish with a generous sprig of mint.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible as it instructs to shake all ingredients with ice, which is a common practice in cocktail making to chill and dilute the drink. Option A instructs to shake with rice, which is not a common ingredient in cocktail making. Additionally, option B specifies to garnish with a sprig of mint, which is a common garnish for Caribbean cocktails."}}
{"Q": "Is it better to use large scissors or small scissors?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It depends on what you're cutting, smaller scissors make more precise cuts. (B) It depends on what you're cutting, smaller scissors make more powerful cuts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) It depends on what you're cutting, smaller scissors make more precise cuts.\nExplanation: The size of the scissors should be chosen based on the task at hand. For intricate and precise cuts, smaller scissors are better as they provide more control and accuracy. On the other hand, larger scissors are better for cutting thicker materials as they provide more power and leverage. Therefore, the answer (A) is more plausible as it takes into account the specific cutting needs."}}
{"Q": "To keep homemade apple juice from turning brown.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) You can take any vitamin c tablets, and add a small, small amount to the food processor. I chop a 500mg tablet into quarters and add all of them to each processor load. (B) You can take any vitamin c tablets, and add a small, small amount to the food processor. I chop a 500mg tablet into quarters and add one of those to each processor load.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Adding too much vitamin C can actually affect the taste of the apple juice. Chopping a 500mg tablet into quarters and adding one of those to each processor load is a more reasonable amount to prevent browning without altering the taste of the juice."}}
{"Q": "How do you steep tea?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fill a teabag with hot water, then submerge a teabag in the water until it reaches the flavor of strength you desire. (B) Fill a teacup with hot water, then submerge a teabag in the water until it reaches the flavor of strength you desire.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Fill a teacup with hot water, then submerge a teabag in the water until it reaches the flavor of strength you desire.\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer because it is the traditional way of steeping tea. The teabag is placed in a teacup filled with hot water and left to steep for a few minutes until the desired strength is achieved. This method allows the tea to infuse properly and release its full flavor. Filling a teabag with hot water as in option A is not a common practice and may not result in a well-steeped cup of tea."}}
{"Q": "To make the spinach ricotta filling.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mix 2 cups of ricotta, 1/2 cup parmesan, 1 clove of garlic minced, 1 egg yolk, and blanched spinach.

Mix and incorporate the ingredients.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it specifically mentions blanched spinach as an ingredient, which is a common ingredient in spinach ricotta filling. Additionally, the use of onion powder in option B is not a common ingredient in spinach ricotta filling recipes."}}
{"Q": "how to slice meat easier", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) place the meat in the oven and broil for 10 to 15 minutes to stiffen it up (B) place the meat in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes to stiffen it up", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Placing the meat in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes will stiffen it up, making it easier to slice. This is a common technique used by chefs and home cooks alike. Broiling the meat in the oven may cause it to become overcooked and dry, making it more difficult to slice. Freezing the meat for too long, however, can cause it to become too hard and difficult to slice, so it's important to keep an eye on the time."}}

(B) give the company your cash before they deliver.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Prepaying for a pizza delivery order typically involves giving the company your card information before they deliver. This allows the company to charge your card for the order before it arrives, ensuring a smooth and quick delivery process. While it is possible to give the company cash beforehand, this is less common and may not be an option for all pizza delivery services."}}
{"Q": "Is there a best way to blow up party balloons?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Before a birthday party or other affair requiring large numbers of inflated balloons, it is helpful to have a dozen or so blowers arrive early. Give each one a handful, depending on how many you need, and then return to the kitchen to continue getting food ready. At least one person will know how to do it right, so they will all eventually figure it out. (B) Invite 10 or 12 kids over half an hour before the party starts. With them watching, blow up a couple of balloons but tell the kids  they aren't allowed to touch them. Then, leave a box of pins on the table and say \"and don't touch these either\" very clearly. Leave the room until you hear the popping sounds.  When you come back in, tell them if they want balloons at the party they're the ones who have to blow them up. You'll have a roomful in about 10 minutes flat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Before a birthday party or other affair requiring large numbers of inflated balloons, it is helpful to have a dozen or so blowers arrive early. Give each one a handful, depending on how many you need, and then return to the kitchen to continue getting food ready. At least one person will know how to do it right, so they will all eventually figure it out.\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it suggests a practical and efficient way to blow up party balloons. It involves delegating the task to a group of people who arrive early and have time to inflate the balloons before the party starts. This method also allows for some trial and error, as there will likely be at least one person who knows how to inflate balloons properly and can teach the others. Option B, on the other hand, involves leaving the task to a group of kids who may not have the skills or patience to inflate the balloons correctly, and may even end up popping them with the pins."}}
{"Q": "Avoid static in clothes without dryer sheets.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Include two saran wrap balls in dryer. (B) Include two foil balls in dryer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Include two foil balls in dryer.\nExplanation: Foil balls can help reduce static in clothes because they create a static charge that neutralizes the static in the clothes. Saran wrap balls may not be as effective as they do not conduct electricity like foil does. Additionally, using foil balls is a more environmentally friendly option as it does not involve the use of disposable dryer sheets."}}
{"Q": "how do you poke around in a building?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) walk and look around. (B) poke each wall of the building.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Walking and looking around the building is a more plausible answer as it allows for a thorough exploration of the building without causing damage or disturbance to the structure.

By swinging the rope without the ball, you can build up momentum and then release the ball to create a smooth swinging motion."}}
{"Q": "How to tell when chicken is cooked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Press the meat to feel if it is firm, if firm it is done, also look at the juices coming from the chicken, if they're clear it is done (B) Press the meat to feel if it is firm, if it shakes it is done, also look at the juices coming from the chicken, if they're pink it is done", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Press the meat to feel if it is firm, if firm it is done, also look at the juices coming from the chicken, if they're clear it is done.\nExplanation: When cooking chicken, it is important to ensure that it is cooked thoroughly to avoid any risk of foodborne illness. One way to tell if chicken is cooked is by pressing the meat to feel if it is firm. If it is firm, it is likely cooked through. Additionally, looking at the juices coming from the chicken can also be a good indicator of doneness. If the juices are clear, it is likely that the chicken is cooked through. If the juices are pink or red, it may need to be cooked for a bit longer. It is important to use a meat thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature of the chicken reaches at least 165°F (74°C) to ensure that it is safe to eat."}}
{"Q": "To make a chalkboard out of wooden pallet planks.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use chalk paint on the wood. (B) Use chalkboard paint on the wood.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use chalkboard paint on the wood.\nExplanation: Chalkboard paint is specifically designed to create a surface that can be written on with chalk. It provides a smooth and durable finish that is perfect for a chalkboard. Using chalk paint on the wood may not provide the same level of durability and may not be as easy to write on with chalk.

{"Q": "Knowing how much water to add to a homemade self watering system.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) About every week add roughly a gallon of water to a corner of the planter, as to not drown the plants. (B) About every week add roughly a ounce of water to a corner of the planter, as to not drown the plants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. About every week add roughly a gallon of water to a corner of the planter, as to not drown the plants.\nExplanation: A gallon of water per week is a more plausible amount to add to a self watering system than just an ounce. Plants require a certain amount of water to thrive, and an ounce of water per week would not be enough to sustain them. Additionally, self watering systems are designed to prevent overwatering, so adding a gallon of water to a corner of the planter would not drown the plants."}}

Drill pilot holes before adding the screws.\nExplanation: By drilling pilot holes before adding screws, you create a pathway for the screw to follow, reducing the amount of force needed to drive the screw in and minimizing the risk of splitting or cracking the wood. This is especially important when working with hardwoods or thin pieces of wood."}}
{"Q": "Hold hair pins near tub.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place pins on top of paper towel roll. (B) Place pins on top of toilet paper roll.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Place pins on top of paper towel roll.\nExplanation: Placing hair pins on top of a toilet paper roll may not be the best option as it can easily fall into the toilet or get wet. On the other hand, placing them on top of a paper towel roll provides a stable surface and reduces the risk of them getting lost or damaged. Additionally, paper towel rolls are often larger and more sturdy than toilet paper rolls, making them a better choice for holding hair pins."}}
{"Q": "To make Langos more Vegan friendly.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Langos' ingredients are Vegan friendly except for the olive oil. (B) Langos' ingredients are Vegan friendly except for the cheese and sour cream.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Langos' ingredients are Vegan friendly except for the cheese and sour cream.\nExplanation: Langos is traditionally made with flour, yeast, salt, and water, which are all vegan-friendly ingredients. However, the toppings usually include cheese and sour cream, which are not vegan. To make Langos more vegan-friendly, one can simply omit the cheese and sour cream toppings and replace them with vegan alternatives such as vegan cheese and vegan sour cream.

(B) Stuff each shoe with wet newspaper as tightly as you can. Let the shoes dry, and then remove the newspaper.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Stuffing each shoe with wet newspaper as tightly as you can and letting the shoes dry is a common method to stretch tight shoes. The moisture from the wet newspaper will expand the material of the shoes, making them more pliable and easier to stretch. Removing the insole after the shoes have dried will provide additional space for your feet. Option B, on the other hand, does not make sense as removing the newspaper before the shoes have dried will not have any effect on stretching the shoes."}}

Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "how to tell if my steak is done, without cutting into it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) use an instant read thermometer. (B) poke it with the knife every 2-3 minutes, until it stops bleeding.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Use an instant read thermometer.\nExplanation: Using an instant read thermometer is the most accurate way to determine if a steak is done without cutting into it. Different levels of doneness have different internal temperatures, so by inserting the thermometer into the thickest part of the steak, you can get an accurate reading of its internal temperature and determine if it is rare, medium rare, medium, or well done. Poking the steak with a knife every 2-3 minutes is not a reliable method as it can cause the juices to escape and result in a dry steak."}}

It is invasive though so cut it back but leave some to help keep your garden plot clear of pests. You can't really ever have too much mint.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: While it is true that peppermint is a wonder and smells great to humans, it is also invasive and can take over a garden if left unchecked. Cutting it back is a good idea, but getting rid of it all may not be necessary. Peppermint tea is a great way to use up excess mint, and it also has many health benefits. However, it is important to note that drinking too much peppermint tea can have negative side effects, such as heartburn and nausea."}}
{"Q": "To attach a peg board to a frame, you can", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Screw the frame to the wall and glue the pegboard to the frame (B) Staple the frame to the wall and sew the pegboard to the frame", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.

Option B, on the other hand, instructs to cook until all sides are blackened, which would result in burnt sausages and is not a desirable outcome."}}
{"Q": "Will rising prices correct a recession?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rising prices are a sign of inflation, but do not necessarily correlate with a correction in recession. The worst case scenario is a recession accompanied by rising cost of living due to inflation of prices and costs related to production and services. (B) Rising prices can signal a deflation, but do not necessarily cause a correction in recession. The worst case scenario of all would be rising prices and unemployment concurrently. Rising cost of living relates to rising costs of production and services.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Rising prices are not a guaranteed solution to correcting a recession. In fact, rising prices can often lead to inflation and a higher cost of living, which can exacerbate the effects of a recession. It is important to address the root causes of a recession, such as a decrease in consumer spending or a decline in business investment, rather than relying on rising prices as a solution."}}

{"Q": "Prevent lipstick on teeth.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Apply layer of vaseline on teeth. (B) Apply layer of vaseline on lips.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Apply layer of vaseline on lips.\nExplanation: Applying a layer of vaseline on the lips can prevent the lipstick from smudging and transferring onto the teeth. This is a more plausible answer as applying vaseline on the teeth can be uncomfortable and may not effectively prevent the lipstick from transferring. Additionally, applying vaseline on the lips can also help keep the lips moisturized and prevent the lipstick from drying out."}}
{"Q": "Identify a one way mirror.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Place your finger on the mirror, if there is a gap between the reflection and your finger tip, it is a one way mirror. (B) Place your finger on the mirror, if there is no gap between the reflection and your finger tip, it is a one way mirror.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Place your finger on the mirror, if there is a gap between the reflection and your finger tip, it is a one way mirror.\nExplanation: A one way mirror, also known as a two-way mirror, is a type of mirror that allows light to pass through in one direction while reflecting it back in the other direction. This means that one side of the mirror appears as a normal mirror, while the other side appears as a transparent window. To identify a one way mirror, you can place your finger on the mirror. If there is a gap between the reflection and your finger tip, it means that the mirror is reflecting light back in the other direction and is therefore a one way mirror. If there is no gap and your finger appears to touch the reflection, it is just a regular mirror."}}
{"Q": "To substitute for potatoes in a dish, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use broccoli because it looks and tastes similar to potatoes (B) Use cauliflower because it looks and tastes similar to potatoes", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use cauliflower because it looks and tastes similar to potatoes.\nExplanation: Cauliflower is a common substitute for potatoes in many dishes because it has a similar texture and mild flavor. Broccoli, on the other hand, has a distinct flavor and texture that may not work well as a substitute for potatoes. Therefore, using cauliflower as a substitute for potatoes is a more plausible option."}}
{"Q": "how do you dispose of razors?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) shove them down the shower drain. (B) throw them away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Throw them away.\nExplanation: Shoving razors down the shower drain can cause clogs and damage to plumbing systems. It is also not safe for sanitation workers who handle trash. The safest and most responsible way to dispose of razors is to wrap them in paper or cardboard and throw them away in a trash bin. Some cities also have specific guidelines for disposing of sharp objects, so it's important to check local regulations."}}
{"Q": "Bring a mat for outdoor concerts.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lay down a bed sheet. (B) Lay down a newspaper sheet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Bring a mat for outdoor concerts.\nExplanation: Bringing a mat specifically designed for outdoor use is the most plausible answer as it provides a comfortable and durable surface to sit on.

{"Q": "To make a cheap terrarium for gecko.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Use glass as the material is transparent and has adequate heat retention for the reptile. (B) Use acrylic as it is way cheaper than glass and still has a lot of pass-through for light to get in.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Use acrylic as it is way cheaper than glass and still has a lot of pass-through for light to get in.\nExplanation: While glass may be a good option for a terrarium, it can be quite expensive. Acrylic, on the other hand, is a more affordable alternative that still allows for adequate light to pass through. Additionally, acrylic is lighter and more durable than glass, making it easier to handle and less likely to break. As long as the acrylic is thick enough to retain heat, it can be a great option for a cheap terrarium for a gecko."}}
{"Q": "Clean soap scum off bathroom tiles.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rub a wet dryer sheet on scum spots. (B) Rub a dry dryer sheet on scum spots.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Rub a wet dryer sheet on scum spots.\nExplanation: Dryer sheets contain fabric softeners and surfactants that can help break down soap scum. Rubbing a wet dryer sheet on the scum spots will help loosen and remove the buildup. Rubbing a dry dryer sheet may not be as effective as it lacks the moisture needed to break down the scum."}}
{"Q": "To coat veggies with flour and seasoning, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a knife to coat the veggies (B) Use a spoon to coat the veggies", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use a spoon to coat the veggies.\nExplanation: Using a knife to coat veggies with flour and seasoning would not be effective as it would not evenly distribute the coating. Using a spoon would allow for a more even coating and better control over the amount of flour and seasoning used."}}
{"Q": "how to properly season a dish", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) season the main components of the dish (B) season all components of the dish", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Seasoning the main components of the dish is more important as it will enhance the flavor of the dish and prevent over-seasoning. Over-seasoning all components of the dish can result in an unbalanced flavor and can mask the natural taste of the ingredients. It is also important to taste the dish as you season to ensure that the flavors are balanced."}}
{"Q": "How to Tell if an Avocado is Bad", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Different varieties of avocado have different skin colours. The most common variety of avocado, the Hass, will change colour to very dark green or purple colour when ripe. (B) Different varieties of avocado have different skin colours. The most common variety of avocado, the Hass, will change colour to very light green or purple colour when ripe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Different varieties of avocado have different skin colours. The most common variety of avocado, the Hass, will change colour to very dark green or purple colour when ripe.\nExplanation: This is the correct answer as the Hass avocado does indeed change to a very dark green or purple colour when it is ripe. The skin of an avocado should not be too soft or too hard, but should give slightly when pressed. Additionally, if there are any visible bruises or dark spots on the skin, it may be an indication that the avocado is bad."}}
{"Q": "blanket", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can cover a sofa from dirt (B) can make a sofa invisible", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: A blanket can be used to cover a sofa and protect it from dirt, spills, and pet hair. It is a practical use for a blanket and a common way to keep furniture clean and well-maintained. On the other hand, making a sofa invisible with a blanket is not a plausible use as it goes beyond the capabilities of a regular blanket."}}
{"Q": "To keep taco fillings from spilling out.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Line your taco shells with a napkin. Then when your shell breaks, the napkin will catch the rest of the fillings. (B) Line your taco shells with a lettuce leaf. Then when your shell breaks, the lettuce leaf will catch the rest of the fillings.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Line your taco shells with a lettuce leaf. Then when your shell breaks, the lettuce leaf will catch the rest of the fillings.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because lettuce leaves are often used as a substitute for taco shells in low-carb diets. The lettuce leaf is sturdy enough to hold the fillings but also flexible enough to wrap around them. Additionally, lettuce is a common ingredient in tacos, so it won't drastically change the taste or texture of the dish. Using a napkin to line the taco shell is not a practical solution as it can easily tear and mix with the fillings, making it difficult to eat."}}
{"Q": "How can I make paper look older?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dip paper in some black tea. (B) Dip paper in some green tea.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Dip paper in some black tea.\nExplanation: Black tea contains tannins which can give paper an aged look. To achieve this, brew a strong cup of black tea and let it cool down. Then, dip the paper in the tea for a few minutes, making sure it is fully submerged. Remove the paper and let it dry completely. The longer you leave the paper in the tea, the darker and more aged it will appear."}}
{"Q": "hose", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can cut camera easily (B) Can be guarded by camera on security monitor", "R": {"text": "Answer: Can be guarded by camera on security monitor.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible as it suggests that the camera can be used to monitor and protect the hose from potential damage or theft. Cutting the hose easily seems unlikely as hoses are typically made of durable materials and cutting them would require a sharp tool or blade. Additionally, it is more practical to use a security camera to monitor and protect valuable equipment rather than relying on physical barriers alone."}}
{"Q": "How do I cut a cake horizontally?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Wrap a piece of dental floss around the cake, where you want it to be cut, place toothpicks around the cake to hold the floss. Pull the floss circle smaller and smaller, to make layers (B) Wrap a piece of dental floss around the cake, where you want it to be cut, place toothpicks in the top of the cake to hold the floss. Pull the floss circle smaller and smaller, to make layers", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Wrapping a piece of dental floss around the cake and using toothpicks to hold it in place is a common method for cutting a cake horizontally. By pulling the floss circle smaller and smaller, you can create even layers. This method is more plausible than option B, which suggests placing toothpicks in the top of the cake to hold the floss, as this could potentially damage the cake or make it difficult to cut evenly."}}
{"Q": "easiest way to pick up shards of broken glass", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) sweep what you can, and then use a nail file to crush it further. (B) gently press a piece of bread onto the floor.and pick up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) gently press a piece of bread onto the floor and pick up.\nExplanation: Using a nail file to crush the glass further can create more dangerous and smaller pieces that can be harder to clean up. Using bread to pick up the shards is a safer and more effective method as the bread can easily pick up the larger pieces without creating more hazards. Additionally, the bread can be disposed of easily and safely."}}

Let sit, covered, 5 minutes, drink 5 beers then stir in 1 1/2 cups shredded mild cheddar and 1 teaspoon dijon mustard until the cheese melts. Top with chopped parsley.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Option A provides a clear and feasible recipe for making cheddar beer rice, using ingredients and cooking methods that are commonly used in rice dishes. Option B includes an unrealistic step of drinking 5 beers while cooking, which is not only unsafe but also unnecessary for making the dish. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How d I keep the Chicken Cordon Bleu rolled up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) insert toothpicks to hold it in place. (B) Use clothespins to hold it in place.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Insert toothpicks to hold it in place.\nExplanation: Toothpicks are a common and practical way to hold the chicken cordon bleu together while cooking. They are small and easy to insert, and they can be easily removed before serving. Clothespins, on the other hand, are not suitable for cooking as they may melt or release harmful chemicals when exposed to heat. Therefore, using toothpicks is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "what pan to use for frying eggs", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nonstick pans are perfect for frying eggs (B) crock pots are the perfect for frying eggs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Nonstick pans are perfect for frying eggs.\nExplanation: Nonstick pans have a smooth surface that prevents eggs from sticking and makes them easy to flip. They also require less oil or butter, making them a healthier option. Crock pots are not suitable for frying eggs as they are designed for slow cooking and do not provide the necessary heat and surface for frying."}}
{"Q": "how do you switch profiles on instagram?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) go to your profile page, then click on your username at the top of the page, then click on the other profile. (B) go to your profile page, then click on your usernmae at the top of the page, and click on signout.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Go to your profile page, then click on your username at the top of the page, then click on the other profile.\nExplanation: This is the correct way to switch profiles on Instagram. By clicking on your username at the top of your profile page, you will see a dropdown menu that shows all the accounts you have logged in to. Simply click on the other profile you want to switch to, and you will be redirected to that account's profile page. Option B is incorrect because signing out will log you out of all your accounts, not just switch to another profile."}}
{"Q": "Upholster a piece of padded wooden furniture.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sew the fabric to the wooden piece on one edge, then stretch the fabric taut as you work around the piece, sewing as you go. (B) Staple the fabric to the wooden piece on one edge, then stretch the fabric taut as you work around the piece, stapling as you go.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Stapling the fabric to the wooden piece on one edge and then stretching the fabric taut as you work around the piece, stapling as you go is a more plausible answer because it is a common method used by professional upholsterers. Sewing the fabric to the wooden piece on one edge and then stretching the fabric taut as you work around the piece, sewing as you go is not a practical method as it would be difficult to maintain the fabric's tension and alignment while sewing. Stapling allows for easier adjustments and a tighter fit."}}

Stir in 2 sliced scallions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: This is the correct recipe for making corn succotash. It involves melting butter in a skillet, sauteing red bell pepper, adding corn kernels, lima beans, water, thyme, salt, and pepper, and then simmering for 5 minutes before stirring in sliced scallions. The ice cream churn mentioned in option A is not necessary for making succotash and seems like an error."}}
{"Q": "wood", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can be carved into a fork  (B) can carve a fork ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: While technically both choices are possible, choice A is more plausible because it specifies that the wood is already in the form of a block or branch that can be carved into a fork. Choice B implies that any piece of wood can be used to carve a fork, which may not be true for all types of wood."}}
{"Q": "fingers", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can be wrapped in tin foil  (B) can be wrapped in sticks ", "R": {"text": "Answer: Fingers can be wrapped in tin foil.\nExplanation: Wrapping fingers in tin foil is a common technique used in cooking to protect them from getting burned while handling hot objects or ingredients.

{"Q": "Break the goal down into smaller pieces.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Divide the goal by a set of specific tasks that will take a certain amount of time to complete. (B) Divide the goal by a set of nonspecific tasks that will take an undetermined amount of time to complete.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Breaking down a goal into smaller pieces involves dividing it into specific tasks that can be completed within a certain timeframe. This approach helps to create a clear plan of action and allows for better time management. On the other hand, dividing the goal into nonspecific tasks that have no set timeframe can lead to confusion and lack of direction. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "To load cylinder containers to a truck.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) use a wooden sheet to make way for easy way of loading the containers to the truck (B) use a ramp to roll the tanks up the truck.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use a ramp to roll the tanks up the truck.\nExplanation: Using a ramp is a more practical and efficient way of loading cylinder containers onto a truck. It allows for a smooth and safe transition of the containers from the ground to the truck bed without the risk of damaging the containers or injuring the workers. Using a wooden sheet may not provide enough support and stability for the containers, and it may also be difficult to maneuver them onto the truck."}}

Follow this pattern and dialogue pattern throughout. (B) Start with the upper left panel, then go right. Move up to the panel beneath that to the left. Follow this pattern and dialogue pattern throughout", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Start with the upper left panel, then go right. Move down to the panel beneath that to the left. Follow this pattern and dialogue pattern throughout.\nExplanation: This is the most common way to read a comic book as it follows the natural flow of reading from left to right and top to bottom. It also ensures that the dialogue is read in the correct order and makes it easier to follow the story."}}
{"Q": "How long should the caulk dry when sealing a concrete countertop mold?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The caulk will need to dry overnight (B) The caulk will need to dry over easy", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The caulk will need to dry overnight.\nExplanation: Caulk typically takes 24 hours to fully dry and cure. It is important to allow enough time for the caulk to dry before pouring the concrete into the mold to prevent any moisture from affecting the concrete's curing process. Therefore, it is recommended to let the caulk dry overnight before proceeding with the concrete countertop mold."}}
{"Q": "Clean kitchen tiles.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use half slice of peach to clean kitchen tiles, then rinse. (B) Use half slice of potato to clean kitchen tiles, then rinse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use half slice of potato to clean kitchen tiles, then rinse.\nExplanation: Using a potato to clean kitchen tiles is a more plausible answer as potatoes contain natural enzymes that can break down dirt and grime. Additionally, potatoes are a common household item and are easily accessible. Using a peach to clean kitchen tiles may not be as effective and could potentially leave a sticky residue on the tiles."}}
{"Q": "toilet tissue", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can clean hair  (B) can clean the sink ", "R": {"text": "Answer: Can clean the sink.\nExplanation: While toilet tissue may not be the most effective tool for cleaning a sink, it is still more plausible than using it to clean hair. Toilet tissue is not designed to remove hair and would likely just tear apart. However, it can be used to wipe down a sink in a pinch."}}
{"Q": "how do you deal with nausea?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) eat more. (B) throw up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Eating more is not always the solution to nausea, but it can help in some cases. Eating small, bland meals throughout the day can help settle the stomach and prevent nausea. It is important to avoid foods that are greasy, spicy, or high in fat, as these can exacerbate nausea. Drinking plenty of fluids and getting rest can also help alleviate nausea. If the nausea persists or is accompanied by other symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention.

Dry in 200 degree oven til shriveled.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because raisins are typically dried, not toasted. The lower temperature of 200 degrees is also more appropriate for drying out the grapes without burning them."}}
{"Q": "how to give pastry's a glossy appearance", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) brush tops with an egg wash (B) filet tops with an egg wash", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Brush tops with an egg wash.\nExplanation: Brushing the tops of pastries with an egg wash (a mixture of beaten egg and water or milk) before baking gives them a shiny, glossy appearance. The proteins in the egg help to create a golden brown color and a shiny finish on the surface of the pastry. This technique is commonly used for pies, breads, and other baked goods to enhance their appearance and give them a professional look. Filing tops with an egg wash is not a common technique and may not produce the desired effect."}}
{"Q": "How to take your bust measurement to help find your bra size.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wrap a measuring tape somewhat loosely around the fullest part of your chest, at waist level and round to the nearest whole number. (B) Wrap a measuring tape somewhat loosely around the fullest part of your chest, at nipple level and round to the nearest whole number.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Wrap a measuring tape somewhat loosely around the fullest part of your chest, at nipple level and round to the nearest whole number.\nExplanation: The fullest part of the chest is typically at nipple level, so measuring at this point will give a more accurate measurement for determining bra size. Measuring at waist level may result in an incorrect measurement and therefore an ill-fitting bra."}}
{"Q": "floss", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can remove gunk from  plastic toys in tight crevices (B) can remove gunk from  tupperware in tight crevices", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Floss is a thin and flexible string that can easily fit into tight crevices. Tupperware often has small crevices that are difficult to clean with a regular sponge or brush, making floss a plausible tool to remove any gunk or residue that may be stuck in those areas. While it is possible that floss could be used to clean plastic toys, it is less likely as toys typically have larger crevices that can be cleaned with a brush or cloth."}}
{"Q": "how to keep pressed flowers with color", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) To ensure the flowers retain the most color, cut them before they are fully open. The flowers should also dry in a bright, warm place so sunlight doesn't fade the colors. (B) To ensure the flowers retain the most color, cut them before they are fully open. The flowers should also dry in a dark, cool place so sunlight doesn't fade the colors.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. To ensure the flowers retain the most color, cut them before they are fully open. The flowers should also dry in a bright, warm place so sunlight doesn't fade the colors.\nExplanation: Cutting the flowers before they are fully open will ensure that they have the most color and are not already starting to fade. Drying them in a bright, warm place will help to preserve the color, but it is important to make sure they are not in direct sunlight as this can cause fading. A dark, cool place may slow down the drying process, but it is not necessary for preserving the color of the flowers."}}
{"Q": "Remove stench from baseball cap.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Place dryer sheets inside cap when wearing. (B) Place dryer sheets outside cap when wearing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Place dryer sheets inside cap when wearing.\nExplanation: Placing dryer sheets inside the cap when wearing will allow the sheets to come into direct contact with the source of the stench, which is likely sweat and bacteria buildup on the inside of the cap. This method will also allow for the scent of the dryer sheets to mask the unpleasant odor. Placing dryer sheets outside the cap may not be as effective in removing the stench as the sheets will not come into direct contact with the source of the odor."}}
{"Q": "How to prep bread.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) With a spoon, cut a slice of butter and spread evenly on both sides of each bread. (B) With a butter knife, cut a slice of butter and spread evenly on both sides of each bread.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. With a butter knife, cut a slice of butter and spread evenly on both sides of each bread.\nExplanation: Using a spoon to spread butter on bread may not be as effective as using a butter knife. A butter knife is specifically designed to spread butter evenly on bread, while a spoon may not be able to cover all areas of the bread. Additionally, cutting a slice of butter with a butter knife allows for more control over the amount of butter being spread on the bread."}}
{"Q": "Improve running form.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Try to run quietly to mimic proper form. (B) Try to run loudly to mimic proper form.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Try to run quietly to mimic proper form.\nExplanation: Running quietly indicates that your feet are landing softly on the ground, which is a sign of good running form. This means that you are landing on the midfoot or forefoot, rather than the heel, which reduces the impact on your joints and helps you run more efficiently. Additionally, running quietly forces you to engage your core and maintain good posture, which are also important aspects of proper running form. On the other hand, running loudly indicates that you are landing heavily on your heels, which can lead to injuries and inefficiency in your running. Therefore, trying to run quietly is a more plausible answer to improve running form."}}
{"Q": "how do you go to your facebook profile from the home page?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) search your name in the search bar on the top. (B) click on the circle button with a person in it on the bottom menu.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Click on the circle button with a person in it on the bottom menu.\nExplanation: The circle button with a person in it is the profile icon, which is located on the bottom menu of the Facebook app. By clicking on it, you will be directed to your own Facebook profile. Option A may work, but it is not the most efficient way to access your profile as it requires you to search for your own name."}}
{"Q": "how do you get a dog to fetch?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) throw a ball away from the dog and yell \"fetch\" (B) pick an object away from the dog and yell \"fetch\"", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: To get a dog to fetch, you should throw a ball or toy away from the dog and say \"fetch\" in a positive tone. This will encourage the dog to run after the object and bring it back to you. It may take some training and positive reinforcement to get the dog to understand the command and bring the object back consistently, but throwing the object away from the dog is a key part of the process. Picking an object away from the dog and yelling \"fetch\" is not a plausible answer as it does not involve the dog actively participating in the game of fetch."}}
{"Q": "How do you harvest chicken eggs?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Collect eggs at least twice a day, especially in hot weather. The first collection should be before 10 a.m. Start by collecting those eggs with no chickens on them. Then carefully lift up those hens sitting in nests, quickly remove any eggs from the nest and put the hens back on their roosts. (B) Collect eggs at least once a day, especially in hot weather. The first collection should be before 10 a.m. Start by collecting those eggs with no chickens on them. Then carefully lift up those hens sitting in nests, quickly remove any eggs from the nest and put the hens back on their roosts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Collecting eggs at least twice a day is recommended, especially in hot weather, to prevent the eggs from spoiling. The first collection should be before 10 a.m. to ensure that the eggs are still fresh. It is important to start by collecting eggs with no chickens on them to avoid any potential damage to the eggs. When lifting up hens sitting in nests, it is important to do so carefully to avoid disturbing them and quickly remove any eggs from the nest. Putting the hens back on their roosts ensures that they can continue to lay eggs in their designated nesting area."}}
{"Q": "To learn how to ride a bike.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Just get on the bike and start riding to learn how to do it consistently. (B) Start with training wheels to help will balance while moving then gradually take them off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Starting with training wheels is a more plausible answer as it provides a gradual transition from having support to riding independently. It helps the rider to gain confidence and balance while moving, and gradually taking off the training wheels will allow the rider to learn how to balance on their own. This method is commonly used for children learning to ride a bike, but it can also be effective for adults who are new to cycling."}}
{"Q": "Save time at baggae claim.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wrap dark cloth around luggage handle. (B) Wrap bright cloth around luggage handle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Wrap bright cloth around luggage handle.\nExplanation: Wrapping a bright cloth around the luggage handle makes it easier to spot your luggage among the sea of similar-looking bags. This can save time at baggage claim as you can quickly identify your luggage and grab it without wasting time searching for it. A dark cloth may blend in with other bags and make it harder to locate your luggage."}}
{"Q": "how to make more room in a closet", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) add an over the door rack for extra storage (B) add an over the washing machine rack for extra storage", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Adding an over the door rack for extra storage is a more plausible answer as it utilizes the vertical space in the closet without taking up any additional floor space. It is also a common and affordable solution for creating more storage in a small closet. On the other hand, adding an over the washing machine rack may not be practical for everyone as not all closets have a washing machine nearby."}}
{"Q": "To remove a zipper from a leather bag, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a pair of pliers to cut away the old zipper (B) Use a pair of scissors to cut away the old zipper", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use a pair of scissors to cut away the old zipper.\nExplanation: Using pliers to cut away the old zipper may damage the leather bag. Scissors are a safer option as they allow for more precision and control when cutting the zipper away from the bag. It is important to be careful when cutting to avoid damaging the leather."}}
{"Q": "To check your breath in a short amount of time,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) lick your wrist with a dollop of spit and smell it ten seconds later. (B) spit onto a napkin and then smell the spit to gauge breath scent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Licking your wrist with a dollop of spit and smelling it ten seconds later is a more plausible answer as it allows you to check your breath quickly without needing any additional materials. Spit onto a napkin may not accurately reflect the scent of your breath as it may mix with the napkin's scent. Additionally, it may not be as convenient to carry a napkin around for this purpose."}}
{"Q": "basket", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can enclose a safety pin  (B) can enclose a hula hoop ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: A basket is typically a small container used for holding small items such as fruits, flowers, or other small objects. It is not practical for a basket to enclose a hula hoop, which is a large and bulky item. On the other hand, a safety pin is a small and compact item that can easily fit inside a basket. Therefore, it is more plausible for a basket to enclose a safety pin."}}
{"Q": "How can I clean my toenails of debris?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Take a pencil tip and work under your nails with it to get the junk out from under them. (B) Take a pencil eraser and work under your nails with it to get the junk out from under them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Using a pencil eraser is a more plausible answer as it is softer and less likely to cause damage or injury to the nail bed compared to using a pencil tip. The eraser can also effectively remove debris without causing discomfort or pain."}}
{"Q": "Prevent water waste in toilet.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Flush after each use. (B) Flush only when defecating.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Flush only when defecating.\nExplanation: Flushing after each use is a waste of water and can lead to unnecessary water usage. By flushing only when defecating, we can save a significant amount of water and reduce our water bills. Additionally, it is a more environmentally friendly option as it reduces the amount of water that is wasted."}}
{"Q": "How to Make a Banana and Oatmeal Facial Peel", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Buy microwaveable oatmeal, preferably plain.

Take one large banana and smash it in a dish, by hand or with a large spoon. Mix up the banana and oatmeal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer as it only requires one easily accessible ingredient, a banana, and microwaveable oatmeal. Option A requires a coconut and papaya, which may not be readily available for everyone. Additionally, smashing the ingredients in a concrete block may not be a safe or practical method for most people."}}
{"Q": "to make a portable bidet for a bed ridden person inexpensively", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) fill warm water in an empty water bottle and squeeze gently as needed (B) fill warm water in an empty dishwashing liquid bottle and squeeze gently as needed", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \n\nExplanation: Filling warm water in an empty water bottle and squeezing it gently as needed is a more plausible answer as it is a simple and inexpensive solution. It is also easy to handle and can be disposed of easily after use. Using an empty dishwashing liquid bottle may not be a good idea as it may contain residue from the detergent which can cause irritation or infection. Additionally, the shape of the bottle may not be suitable for use as a bidet."}}
{"Q": "To become frightened of a movie again after seeing it before,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) look up reviews for the movie to better understand it. (B) wait a few years before watching it a second time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Wait a few years before watching it a second time.\nExplanation: Waiting a few years before watching the movie again can help to distance oneself from the initial fear and allow for a fresh viewing experience. This can also give time for the viewer to mature and potentially have a different perspective on the movie. Looking up reviews may provide some insight, but it may not necessarily alleviate the fear and could potentially spoil the plot."}}
{"Q": "To open up bolts.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use a spanner and revolve the spanner over the bolt until the bolt is opened. (B) Use adjustable spanner by putting it over the bolt and turning the bolt anti-clockwise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Use adjustable spanner by putting it over the bolt and turning the bolt anti-clockwise.\nExplanation: Using an adjustable spanner is a more plausible answer as it is specifically designed for turning bolts and can be adjusted to fit different sizes of bolts. Revolving a regular spanner over the bolt may not provide enough grip or torque to open the bolt. Additionally, turning the bolt anti-clockwise is the standard direction for loosening bolts."}}
{"Q": "What is a good alternative to sandpaper when removing varnish from wood?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A wood filer would remove varnish safely. (B) A liquid solvent would remove varnish safely.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. A liquid solvent would remove varnish safely.\nExplanation: Using a liquid solvent such as paint stripper or varnish remover is a safer and more effective alternative to sandpaper when removing varnish from wood. Sandpaper can damage the wood and create dust that can be harmful to breathe in. A liquid solvent breaks down the varnish, making it easier to remove without damaging the wood. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when using a liquid solvent."}}
{"Q": "how do you exchange an item?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) take the item and reciept back to the original store, and get another item to keep in its place. (B) take the item back to the original store, and switch it for something else you want to keep.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer because it involves returning the item with the receipt to the original store and getting another item to keep in its place. This is a common practice for exchanges and ensures that the store can verify the original purchase and provide a replacement item. Option B suggests simply switching the item for something else without any mention of a receipt or the original purchase, which may not be possible or allowed by the store's return policy."}}
{"Q": "Cure a headache with a drink.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Brew some ginger tea. (B) Brew some kool-aid.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Brew some ginger tea.\nExplanation: Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation in the blood vessels in the head, which can cause headaches. Kool-aid, on the other hand, is a sugary drink that is unlikely to have any medicinal properties to alleviate a headache. Therefore, brewing some ginger tea is a more plausible answer to cure a headache."}}
{"Q": "Protect wooden surface from moisture.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Apply vinegar and water to the surface with a soft brush or sponge brush. Let dry completely. (B) Apply clear poly coat to the surface with a soft brush or sponge brush. Let dry completely.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Apply clear poly coat to the surface with a soft brush or sponge brush. Let dry completely.\nExplanation: Applying a clear poly coat creates a protective layer on the wooden surface, preventing moisture from seeping in and causing damage. Vinegar and water may clean the surface, but it does not provide a protective layer against moisture."}}
{"Q": "How long do I bake the semolina-coconut mixture when making a basbousa?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bake the mixture in a preheated washer for 35 to 45 minutes (B) Bake the mixture in a preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Bake the mixture in a preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes.\nExplanation: Basbousa is typically baked in an oven, not a washer. The baking time for basbousa is usually around 35 to 45 minutes, depending on the recipe and the oven temperature. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How can I keep buttons from falling off my clothes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Paint a bit of clear nail polish remover over the threads that go over the top of the buttons. (B) Paint a bit of clear nail polish over the threads that go over the top of the buttons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Paint a bit of clear nail polish over the threads that go over the top of the buttons.\nExplanation: Clear nail polish can act as a sealant and prevent the threads from unraveling and the buttons from falling off. It creates a barrier that keeps the threads in place and strengthens the bond between the button and the fabric. However, it is important to use clear nail polish and not nail polish remover, as the latter can dissolve the threads and weaken the fabric. Additionally, it is recommended to apply the nail polish in thin layers and let it dry completely before wearing the garment."}}
{"Q": "clamp", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can be used like a  marker  (B) can hold a marker marker ", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) can hold a marker.\nExplanation: A clamp is a device used to hold objects tightly together to prevent movement or separation. It is commonly used in woodworking, metalworking, and other manufacturing processes. While a clamp could potentially be used as a marker, it is not a common or practical use for the tool. On the other hand, it is common for clamps to hold markers or other writing utensils in place while working on a project. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How should I open jump rings when making earrings?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Pull the wire of the jump ring as far apart as possible to make the gap size that you need. This method keeps the jump rings structurally sound and is essential for closing them in their proper shape. (B) Twist the wire of the jump ring slightly to the side. Twist just enough to make the gap size that you need. This method keeps the jump rings structurally sound and is essential for closing them in their proper shape.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Twisting the wire of the jump ring slightly to the side is a more plausible answer because it creates a gap without pulling the wire apart, which can weaken the jump ring and make it more difficult to close properly. Twisting just enough to make the gap size needed will keep the jump ring structurally sound and ensure that it can be closed in its proper shape."}}
{"Q": "How can I clean my tennis shoes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Apply toothpaste to an old toothbrush and then work the paste into the dirty soles of the shoes then leave the toothpaste on the shoes for about ten minutes, and then wipe it off with a damp towel. Repeat the process if necessary. (B) Apply toothpaste to an old toothbrush and then work the paste into the dirty spots then leave the toothpaste on the shoes for about ten minutes, and then wipe it off with a damp towel. Repeat the process if necessary.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Apply toothpaste to an old toothbrush and then work the paste into the dirty soles of the shoes then leave the toothpaste on the shoes for about ten minutes, and then wipe it off with a damp towel. Repeat the process if necessary.\nExplanation: This method is more plausible as the soles of tennis shoes tend to accumulate more dirt and grime than the upper part of the shoe. Toothpaste is a common household item that can effectively clean the soles of shoes. Leaving the toothpaste on for ten minutes allows it to penetrate the dirt and stains, making it easier to wipe off with a damp towel. Repeating the process if necessary ensures that all the dirt and stains are removed."}}
{"Q": "how to make pasta", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) place flour on a clean nonporous surface and create a well in the middle, add egg yolks and mix them together then roll it out thick as you can get it and cut it into strips. (B) place flour on a clean nonporous surface and create a well in the middle, add egg yolks and mix them together then roll it out as thin as you can get it and cut it into strips.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Rolling out the pasta as thin as possible will result in a more authentic and traditional texture for the pasta. Thicker pasta may be too heavy and doughy. Additionally, cutting the pasta into strips is a common way to prepare it for cooking."}}
{"Q": "handkerchief", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can act as patch  on a real person's bed (B) can act as a comforter on a real person's bed", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: A handkerchief is too small to act as a comforter on a real person's bed. However, it can be used as a patch on a real person's bed if there is a tear or hole in the bedding."}}
{"Q": "how do you call the fuzz", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) dial 911 (B) dial fuzz under contacts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Dial fuzz under contacts.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible as \"fuzz\" is a slang term for police officers. It is unlikely that dialing 911 and asking for \"the fuzz\" would result in a prompt response from emergency services. However, if someone has saved the contact information for their local police department under the name \"fuzz,\" they could easily call them using this option."}}
{"Q": "Make Peach Lemonade", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put the sugar, cinnamon sticks and 1 cup of water into a large, heavy-based pressure cooker with a can of milk. Heat the liquid on low heat and stir regularly until sugar dissolves (approximately 5 - 8 minutes). Allow to simmer for approximately quarter of an hour or until the mixture thickens to a syrup-like consistency.

The electric guitar and skillet listed in option B are not necessary or practical for making a fall wreath."}}
{"Q": "What if you have the nagging feeling you haven't installed your new car seat right?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Take the seat to the nearest firehose and the fire fighters there will help to show you how to do it.(They do this regularly - it's no big ask). (B) Take the seat to the nearest firehouse and the fire fighters there will help to show you how to do it.(They do this regularly - it's no big ask).", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Take the seat to the nearest firehouse and the fire fighters there will help to show you how to do it. (They do this regularly - it's no big ask).\nExplanation: Firefighters are trained to properly install car seats and often offer this service to the public for free. It is important to ensure that your child's car seat is installed correctly for their safety, so seeking help from professionals is a wise decision. Option A is not a plausible answer as firehoses are not typically used for car seat installations and it is unlikely that firefighters would be able to assist in this manner."}}
{"Q": "To sharpen the end of a nail, you can", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Run the end of the nail on concrete until it becomes sharp (B) Run the end of the nail on mulch until it becomes sharp", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Running the end of a nail on concrete is a more plausible answer as concrete is a hard and abrasive surface that can wear down the nail and create a sharp point. Mulch, on the other hand, is a soft and organic material that is unlikely to sharpen a nail."}}
{"Q": "To add fragrance to glycerin for making soap.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Add oils after soap has melted. (B) Brush oils after soap had been molded.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Add oils after soap has melted.\nExplanation: Adding oils to glycerin after it has melted and before it is molded into soap allows for the fragrance to be evenly distributed throughout the soap. Brushing oils onto the soap after it has been molded may result in uneven distribution and may not provide as strong of a fragrance."}}
{"Q": "How do you snuff a candle?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Hold a small convex cup over the top of the flame to strangle it with it's own smoke. (B) Hold a small concave cup over the top of the flame to strangle it with it's own smoke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Hold a small convex cup over the top of the flame to strangle it with its own smoke.\nExplanation: This is the correct answer because when you hold a convex cup over the flame, it creates a vacuum that pulls the flame towards the cup and suffocates it with its own smoke. On the other hand, a concave cup would magnify the flame and make it harder to extinguish."}}
{"Q": "To save money on storage bags,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) after using, if they aren't really greasy or shiny, wash them out and let them dry, then reuse. (B) after using, if they aren't really greasy or messy, wash them out and let them dry, then reuse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Washing and reusing storage bags that aren't greasy or shiny is a practical way to save money and reduce waste. It's important to make sure the bags are completely dry before reusing them to prevent any potential bacterial growth. However, if the bags are too greasy or messy, it's better to dispose of them and use a new one to avoid any contamination or food spoilage."}}

Freeze about 8 hours until firm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Option A includes ingredients that are commonly used in making ice cream such as whipping cream and sweetened condensed milk. The addition of lemon extract and chopped Lemon Cooler Cookies also makes sense for a lemon Cooler cookie ice cream flavor. Option B, on the other hand, includes an unusual ingredient - jalapeno juice - which is not typically used in ice cream making and may not be appealing to everyone."}}
{"Q": "To rub spices onto pork", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Use your hands to apply the spices (B) Use a brush to apply the spices", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Use your hands to apply the spices.\nExplanation: Using your hands to apply the spices allows for better control and distribution of the spices onto the pork. It also allows you to feel the texture of the meat and ensure that the spices are evenly coated. Using a brush may not distribute the spices as evenly and may also result in some of the spices being left behind on the brush."}}
{"Q": "How can I get rid of dark circles under my eyes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Simply soak cotton balls in rose water. Place those cotton balls under your lips and leave them for ten minutes. (B) Simply soak cotton balls in rose water. Place those cotton balls under your eyes and leave them for ten minutes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Dark circles under the eyes can be caused by a variety of factors, including lack of sleep, dehydration, and genetics. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, placing cotton balls soaked in rose water under the eyes for ten minutes can help reduce puffiness and inflammation, which can contribute to the appearance of dark circles. The rose water also has a soothing effect on the skin, making it a gentle and natural remedy to try. However, it is important to note that this may not completely eliminate dark circles and other lifestyle changes may be necessary for long-term improvement."}}
{"Q": "To remove permanent marker from clothes", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) use hand sanitizer (B) use hand soap", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. use hand sanitizer\nExplanation: Hand sanitizer contains alcohol which can break down the ink in permanent markers.

Hand soap may not be as effective in removing permanent marker stains."}}
{"Q": "Prevent slammed doors from injuring kids' fingers.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put pasta noodle on door side. (B) Put pool noodle on door side.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Put pool noodle on door side.\nExplanation: Putting a pool noodle on the door side is a more plausible answer as it provides a thicker and more cushioned barrier between the door and the frame, reducing the impact and force of the door closing. A pasta noodle may not be thick enough to provide adequate protection and may break easily, rendering it ineffective. Additionally, pool noodles are readily available and can be easily cut to size and attached to the door frame."}}
{"Q": "Dry small clothes without a dryer machine.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Put items in a salad spinner. (B) Put items in a salad bowl.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Put items in a salad spinner.\nExplanation: A salad spinner is designed to remove excess water from vegetables and fruits, making it a perfect tool for drying small clothes. Simply place the clothes in the spinner, give it a few spins, and the excess water will be removed. This method is more plausible than putting clothes in a salad bowl, which would not effectively remove water and could potentially damage the clothes."}}
{"Q": "how do you 'spread peace?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) be nice to everyone all the time (B) be mean to everyone all the time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. be nice to everyone all the time.\nExplanation: Spreading peace involves promoting harmony and understanding among people. Being nice to everyone all the time can help create a positive environment and encourage others to do the same. It can also help to diffuse conflicts and prevent them from escalating. Being mean to everyone all the time, on the other hand, can only create more tension and hostility, which is counterproductive to spreading peace."}}
{"Q": "to cut the fabric for the patchwork rug fast", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) fold the fabric in 4-6 layers, then cut using a jigsaw (B) fold the fabric in 4-6 layers, then cut using scissors", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Folding the fabric in 4-6 layers and using a jigsaw will allow for multiple layers to be cut at once, saving time and ensuring that the pieces are all the same size. Using scissors may result in uneven cuts and take longer to cut through multiple layers."}}
{"Q": "napkin", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can absorb liquid like can  (B) can absorb liquid like socks ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Napkins are designed to absorb liquid spills and messes, and they are typically made from materials that are absorbent, such as paper or cloth. While socks may also be absorbent, they are not typically used for cleaning up spills and are not designed for this purpose. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "To thicken a mixture", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Add corn starch (B) Add corn syrup", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Add corn starch.\nExplanation: Corn starch is a common thickening agent used in cooking and baking. When mixed with a liquid, it forms a paste that thickens the mixture as it cooks. Corn syrup, on the other hand, is a sweetener and does not have thickening properties. Therefore, adding corn starch is a more plausible answer to thicken a mixture."}}
{"Q": "To make a good Thank giving food basket for low income people,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) pack the basket with holiday classics like turkey and gravy, (B) pack the basket with bulk dry good like beans and rice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: While turkey and gravy may be a traditional Thanksgiving meal, it may not be feasible for low-income families who may not have access to a full kitchen or the means to cook a large meal. Packing the basket with bulk dry goods like beans and rice can provide a more practical and sustainable option for families to have a nutritious meal during the holiday season. Additionally, including non-perishable items like canned vegetables and fruits can also provide a well-rounded meal for families in need."}}
{"Q": "Sharpen a pencil with a knife.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Have a very sharp knife.  Hold the pencil in one hand and the knife in the other. Place the knife onto the pencil where you want to narrow the pencil, above where the pencil point will be.  Move the knife away from you and towards the point. The angle of the knife should be shallow such that it removes a layer of material as the knife is moved. Rotate the pencil a small amount and repeat the material removal until the pencil point it formed. (B) Have a very sharp knife.  Hold the pencil in one hand and the knife in the other. Place the knife onto the pencil where you want to narrow the pencil, above where the pencil point will be.  Hold the knife at 90 degrees to the pencil.  Move the knife away from you and towards the point.  The knife will scrape along the surface and do very little.

{"Q": "how to clean a cast iron skillet", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) pour some coarse salt into the pan and use half a potato to rub it in until that mess has broken up and can be rinsed away. (B) pour some coarse salt into the pan and use half a baked  potato with sour cream to rub it in until that mess has broken up and can be rinsed away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it suggests using coarse salt and a potato to scrub away any food residue or rust on the cast iron skillet. The coarse salt acts as an abrasive while the potato helps to break up the mess. Option B, on the other hand, suggests using a baked potato with sour cream which may not be as effective in cleaning the skillet."}}
{"Q": "Pay the mortgage payment.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Empty one of the bedrooms and put an ad on Craigslist to have someone come and rent a room from you thus bringing your mortgage payment down. (B) Work as many hours as you can and save the money to pay the bills.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Work as many hours as you can and save the money to pay the bills.\nExplanation: While option A may seem like a quick fix, it involves taking on a stranger as a roommate and potentially compromising your safety and privacy. Option B, on the other hand, is a more responsible and sustainable solution. By working hard and saving money, you can ensure that you are able to consistently make your mortgage payments without having to rely on outside sources."}}
{"Q": "When making a modern planter box, what type of wood should I get?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Since this is for the outdoors and will have regular exposure to water, you should get something that will hold up well, such as cedar. (B) Since this is for the outdoors and will have regular exposure to water, you should get something that will hold up well, such as particle board.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Since this is for the outdoors and will have regular exposure to water, you should get something that will hold up well, such as cedar.\nExplanation: Cedar is a popular choice for outdoor projects because it is naturally resistant to rot and decay. It also has a beautiful natural color and grain pattern. Particle board, on the other hand, is not suitable for outdoor use as it is made from wood chips and glue, which can easily break down when exposed to moisture."}}
{"Q": "To smoke tobacco with a coke can,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) make an indention on the end of the can opposite of the mouth opening and then puncture holes for the tobacco smoke into the indention. (B) put the tobacco leaves inside of the can along with a match and then cover the can's hole with your mouth and inhale the smoke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Making an indention on the end of the can opposite of the mouth opening and then puncturing holes for the tobacco smoke into the indention is a more plausible answer because it creates a makeshift bowl for the tobacco to sit in and allows for the smoke to be drawn through the holes. Option B is not a safe or effective method as it involves lighting the tobacco inside the can, which can release harmful chemicals and potentially cause the can to explode."}}
{"Q": "How do I organize a neighborhood cleanup", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tape up posters over your neighborhood with a date and time of when to clean (B) Tape up posters over your vehicle with a date and time of when to clean", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tape up posters over your neighborhood with a date and time of when to clean.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it targets the entire neighborhood and not just one person's vehicle. By posting flyers around the neighborhood, more people are likely to see it and participate in the cleanup. It also provides a specific date and time for everyone to come together and work towards a common goal."}}
{"Q": "how to make nut brittle", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Microwave 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup light corn syrup and 1 1/2 cups salted mixed nuts until the syrup is golden, about 8 minutes, stirring twice.

{"Q": "To anneal a metal file, you can", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Heat it with a blowtorch until the file loses its magnetism (B) Heat it with a toaster until the file loses its magnetism", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Heat it with a blowtorch until the file loses its magnetism.\nExplanation: Annealing is a process of heating a metal to a specific temperature and then cooling it slowly to make it softer and more malleable. A blowtorch is a tool commonly used for annealing metal because it can provide a high and consistent heat source. To determine if the metal file has been annealed, one can check if it has lost its magnetism, which is an indication that the metal has been heated to a high enough temperature to change its properties. Using a toaster to anneal a metal file is not a plausible answer because it cannot provide the necessary heat and temperature control required for the annealing process."}}
{"Q": "how do you edit an order at a drive thru?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) tell them the different order at the payment window after paying. (B) tell them the different order at the payment window before paying.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible to tell the drive-thru employee the different order before paying at the payment window.

{"Q": "How to Figure Out the Area of a Parallelogram", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) To figure out the area of a parallelogram, you need to know the length and width. Divide these two figures. The area will be marked in units squared (²) (B) To figure out the area of a parallelogram, you need to know the length and width. Multiply these two figures together. The area will be marked in units squared (²)", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: To find the area of a parallelogram, you need to multiply the length and width together. This is because the shape of a parallelogram is such that the height (or perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides) is not given, so you cannot simply multiply the base and height together like you would for a triangle. Therefore, the correct formula for finding the area of a parallelogram is A = base x height, or in this case, A = length x width."}}

By reading different styles and forms of poetry, you can get a sense of what you like and what you don't like. Once you have an idea of what you want to write about, you can practice writing your own poems. This will help you develop your own style and voice as a poet. Copying someone else's work is not only unethical, but it also doesn't help you develop your own skills as a writer. It's important to put in the time and effort to learn and practice writing poetry on your own."}}
{"Q": "How to increase the heat in a coal fire?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) If the coals are already hot and you need to increase the heat, take some fresh coals and chips of wood and layer them over the hot coals, close the grill for about 20 minutes and the new coals will be piping hot (B) If the coals are already hot and you need to increase the heat, take some hot coals and chips of wood and layer them over the other hot coals, close the grill for about 20 minutes and the hot coals will be piping hot", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. If the coals are already hot and you need to increase the heat, take some fresh coals and chips of wood and layer them over the hot coals, close the grill for about 20 minutes and the new coals will be piping hot.\n\nExplanation: Adding fresh coals and wood chips will provide more fuel for the fire, which will increase the heat. Layering them over the hot coals will allow them to ignite and start burning quickly. This method is commonly used by grillers and pitmasters to maintain a consistent temperature and increase the heat when needed. Adding hot coals to already hot coals may not provide enough fuel to increase the heat significantly."}}

{"Q": "How to increase the water content of a piece of meat.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Soak the meat in a solution of salt, sugars, spices for several hours. (B) Soak the meat in plain tap water for a few minutes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Soak the meat in a solution of salt, sugars, spices for several hours.\nExplanation: Soaking the meat in a solution of salt, sugars, and spices for several hours is a common technique called brining. The salt in the solution helps to break down the muscle fibers in the meat, allowing it to absorb more water and become more tender. The sugar in the solution also helps to retain moisture in the meat. On the other hand, soaking the meat in plain tap water for a few minutes may not be enough time for the water to penetrate the meat and increase its water content significantly."}}
{"Q": "How to clean a fish globe?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Take the fish out and put in another cup of water. Drain the water from the globe and clean it using water. (B) Take the fish out and put in another cup of oil. Drain the water from the globe and clean it using oil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Taking the fish out and putting it in another cup of water is the correct way to clean a fish globe. It is important to remove the fish from the dirty water to prevent any harm to the fish. Then, the water in the globe can be drained and the globe can be cleaned using fresh water. Using oil to clean the globe is not a suitable option as it can harm the fish and make the globe difficult to clean."}}

(B) make sure when you start it up that the check engine light comes on. People sometimes rip out the  upholstery so you don't know it needs repairs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Checking if the check engine light comes on when starting the car is a common practice when purchasing a used car. This is because it indicates if there are any issues with the engine that need to be addressed. On the other hand, ripping out the upholstery does not affect the car's performance or safety, so it is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "To prepare the false eyelashes for application,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Squeeze a thin line of glue from the bottle along the bottom edge of the false eyelashes (B) Squeeze a line of glue onto the edge of the false eyelashes", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Squeeze a thin line of glue from the bottle along the bottom edge of the false eyelashes.\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer because it ensures that the glue is evenly distributed along the bottom edge of the false eyelashes, which is where it needs to be applied for proper adhesion. Squeezing the glue directly onto the edge of the false eyelashes may result in uneven distribution and clumping, which can make the application process more difficult and result in a less natural-looking final result."}}
{"Q": "How can you cure hiccups at home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Hold your breath, then swallow 3 times. (B) Hold your remote, then swallow 3 times.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Hold your breath, then swallow 3 times.\nExplanation: Holding your breath and swallowing three times can help to reset the diaphragm, which is the muscle responsible for causing hiccups. This method increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, which can help to relax the diaphragm and stop the hiccups. Holding a remote control has no effect on hiccups."}}
{"Q": "Remove greasy prints from walls.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wipe walls with lettuce. (B) Wipe walls with white bread.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Wipe walls with white bread.\nExplanation: White bread has absorbent properties that can help remove greasy prints from walls.

(B) Combine 1/2 cup chopped Pineapple peels, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tbsp. butter, then place in unbaked tart shell, bake for 18 min.  in 375 degree oven, check and remove when browned.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Combine 1/2 cup peeled chopped Pineapple, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tbsp. butter, then place in unbaked tart shell, bake for 18 min. in 375 degree oven, check and remove when browned.\nExplanation: This option makes more sense as it uses the actual pineapple fruit instead of just the peels. The combination of pineapple, sugar, and butter is a common filling for pineapple tarts. Baking the tart shell with the filling for 18 minutes at 375 degrees is also a reasonable baking time and temperature."}}
{"Q": "folder", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can hold clothes hangers with clothes on (B) can hold paper dolls with clothes on", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: A folder is typically used for storing paper documents, so it is more plausible that it can hold clothes hangers with clothes on, which are also made of paper or fabric. It is less likely that a folder would be used to store paper dolls with clothes on, as this is not a common use for folders and the dolls may not fit properly."}}

Overall, incorporating a variety of fruits and vegetables into your diet is important for achieving a well balanced diet."}}
{"Q": "Deter mosquitoes from camp fire.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Burn sage in the fire. (B) Burn twigs in the fire.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Burn sage in the fire.\nExplanation: Burning sage is a natural mosquito repellent and has been used for centuries to keep insects away. The smoke from burning sage contains compounds that mosquitoes find unpleasant, which makes it an effective way to deter them from the campfire. Burning twigs may produce smoke, but it is unlikely to have the same mosquito-repelling effect as sage."}}
{"Q": "To protect your car from scratches in your garage,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) glue or tape pool noodles to the walls at the car's level. (B) leave pillows next to where your car parks in the garage.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Glue or tape pool noodles to the walls at the car's level.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because pool noodles are soft and can provide a cushion for the car if it accidentally hits the wall. Additionally, they are easy to install and can be cut to fit the specific area where the car parks. Leaving pillows next to the car may not be as effective because they can easily move out of place and may not provide enough protection for the car."}}
{"Q": "hot mitts", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can keep warm hands in the snow (B) can keep warm torsos in the snow", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Hot mitts are designed to keep hands warm in cold weather, not torsos. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}

(B) Pour small amount of olive oil into frying pan over hot stove. Add onions and stir occasionally, cooking until transparent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Pour small amount of olive oil into frying pan over hot stove. Add onions and stir occasionally, cooking until transparent.\nExplanation: Sauteing onions involves cooking them in a small amount of oil over high heat until they become translucent and slightly caramelized. A frying pan is the best option for this method as it allows for even heat distribution and easy stirring. A baking sheet is not suitable for sauteing as it does not have high enough sides to contain the onions and oil, and it may not heat evenly."}}
{"Q": "how do you file down a dogs teeth?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) use a nail file on their teeth. (B) give them a bone to chew on.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Giving them a bone to chew on.\nExplanation: Filing down a dog's teeth is not a recommended practice as it can cause damage to the tooth and potentially lead to infection. Giving them a bone to chew on, however, can help naturally wear down their teeth and keep them healthy. It is important to choose a bone that is appropriate for your dog's size and chewing habits to prevent any choking hazards or dental damage."}}

{"Q": "how to measure liquids", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bend down to get eye level with standard measuring cups and pour. Stop when the meniscus is at the top of the cup. (B) Bend down to get eye level with standard measuring cups and pour. Stop when the meniscus is at the bottom of the line", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Bend down to get eye level with standard measuring cups and pour. Stop when the meniscus is at the top of the cup.\nExplanation: This is the correct way to measure liquids as it ensures accuracy. The meniscus is the curved surface of the liquid in the measuring cup, and it can be difficult to determine the exact level of the liquid. By bending down to get eye level with the cup, you can ensure that the meniscus is at the correct level, which is the top of the cup. This method is commonly used in cooking and baking to ensure that the correct amount of liquid is added to the recipe. Choosing option B, which suggests stopping when the meniscus is at the bottom of the line, is not accurate as the line may not be at the correct level and can lead to incorrect measurements."}}

{"Q": "Remove stains from eye glasses.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rub with coffee beans. (B) Rub with coffee filters.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Rub with coffee filters.\nExplanation: Rubbing eye glasses with coffee filters is a more plausible answer as they are made of a soft, non-abrasive material that can effectively remove smudges and stains without scratching the lenses. Coffee beans, on the other hand, are rough and can potentially scratch the lenses, causing more harm than good."}}
{"Q": "How can I keep bathroom mirrors from fogging up?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Coat with candle wax and buff off. (B) Coat with car wax and buff off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Coat with car wax and buff off.\nExplanation: Car wax contains hydrophobic properties that repel water, which can prevent fog from forming on the mirror. Applying a thin layer of car wax and buffing it off can create a barrier that prevents moisture from sticking to the mirror surface. This method is more plausible than using candle wax, which may leave a residue and not provide the same level of water resistance."}}

{"Q": "How can I tell if a watermelon will be watery?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The taller it is the higher the water content. (B) The shorter it is the higher the water content.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The shorter it is the higher the water content.\nExplanation: The water content of a watermelon is determined by its ripeness and size. A ripe watermelon will have a higher water content than an unripe one. However, the size of the watermelon does not necessarily determine its water content. A smaller watermelon may have a higher water content because it has less flesh and more water per unit of weight. Therefore, it is more plausible that a shorter watermelon will have a higher water content than a taller one."}}
{"Q": "How do you make a buttermilk substitute for pancakes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) To make a buttermilk substitute, take one cup of milk and empty out one tablespoon of it. Replace the tablespoon of milk with a tablespoon of white vinegar, and leave for twenty minutes. (B) To make a buttermilk substitute, take one cup of milk and empty out one cup of it.

{"Q": "How do you crack hardwood floor?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jump up and down on it, it should eventually break. (B) Throw a bowling ball at it, it should make a dent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Neither option is a plausible way to crack hardwood floor. \nExplanation: Hardwood floors are designed to withstand normal wear and tear, including foot traffic and furniture movement. Jumping up and down on it or throwing a bowling ball at it would not be enough force to crack the floor. In fact, these actions could potentially damage the finish or cause scratches on the surface, but they would not crack the actual hardwood. If you want to intentionally crack a hardwood floor, you would need to use heavy machinery or tools, which is not recommended."}}
{"Q": "a rumor", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) upheaves deafness efficiently (B) upheaves elections efficiently", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The word \"rumor\" suggests that the statement is related to something that is being talked about or spread around. The option \"upheaves elections efficiently\" seems more plausible as rumors can often affect the outcome of elections by swaying public opinion. The option \"upheaves deafness efficiently\" does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "To make cucumber ribbons for salmon rolls.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Trim the ends off a cucumber, then carefully run a vegetable slicer lengthwise to produce ribbons. (B) Starting at one end use a knife to peel a cucumber in a circular/clockwise direction to produce one long ribbon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Using a vegetable slicer to produce cucumber ribbons is a common and efficient method.

(B) After drilling a pilot hole use a screwdriver to tighten the screw locking them together.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. After drilling a pilot hole use a screwdriver to tighten the screw locking them together.\nExplanation: Using a saw to tighten the screw is not a plausible answer as a saw is not designed for this purpose and may damage the wood. Using a screwdriver to tighten the screw after drilling a pilot hole is the correct method as it ensures a secure and tight fit without damaging the wood."}}
{"Q": "garage", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can be used to store  houses in (B) can be used to store  tires in", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) can be used to store tires in.\nExplanation: While it is technically possible to store miniature model houses in a garage, it is much more common and practical to use a garage for storing vehicles or other large items. On the other hand, storing tires in a garage is a common and practical use of the space, especially during seasonal changes when tires need to be swapped out. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "To force a turnover in football,", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) either recover a fumble, get an interception, or force the opponent to get a first down. (B) either recover a fumble, get an interception, or force a turnover on downs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: To force a turnover in football, a team must either recover a fumble or get an interception, or force a turnover on downs. A turnover on downs occurs when the opposing team fails to convert a fourth down and the ball is turned over to the other team. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it includes all three possible ways to force a turnover. Option A is incorrect as forcing the opponent to get a first down does not result in a turnover."}}
{"Q": "To comfort a homesick child while they're away at camp,", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) send them special letters. (B) give them space to get over it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Send them special letters.\nExplanation: Sending special letters to a homesick child while they're away at camp can help them feel connected to home and loved ones. The letters can include updates on what's happening at home, words of encouragement, and reminders of how proud you are of them for being at camp. This can help ease their homesickness and make them feel more comfortable and supported while they're away. Giving them space to get over it may not be the best approach as it may make them feel more isolated and alone."}}
{"Q": "books", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) shelved on weights of window (B) shelved on ledge of window", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) shelved on ledge of window\nExplanation: It is more plausible for books to be shelved on a ledge of a window rather than on the weights of a window. The weights of a window are typically used to counterbalance the weight of the window itself and would not be a stable or practical surface for shelving books. A ledge of a window, on the other hand, could provide a flat and sturdy surface for books to be placed on."}}
{"Q": "To mix salt and sugar together, you can", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place them in a bowl and use a soup can (B) Place them in a bowl and use a fork", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Place them in a bowl and use a fork.\nExplanation: Using a fork to mix salt and sugar together is a more plausible answer as it allows for better control and distribution of the two ingredients. A soup can may not be as effective in mixing the two ingredients evenly. Additionally, using a fork is a common kitchen tool for mixing ingredients together."}}
{"Q": "To eliminate the chance of sparks when cutting an aerosol can.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Make sure the can is empty by puncturing a hole in it. (B) Make sure the can is wet by soaking it in water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Make sure the can is empty by puncturing a hole in it.\nExplanation: Puncturing a hole in the can will release any remaining pressure and allow the contents to be safely emptied. This eliminates the risk of sparks being created during the cutting process. Soaking the can in water may not be effective in eliminating the risk of sparks and could potentially create other hazards."}}
{"Q": "a shelf", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can hold a book  (B) can hold milk ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: A shelf is typically designed to hold books or other similar items, such as decorative objects or office supplies. While it is possible for a shelf to hold milk, it is not the most common or practical use for a shelf. Milk is typically stored in a refrigerator or cooler, not on a shelf. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Acetone", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) removing pen marks safely (B) removing peroxide safely", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Acetone is commonly used as a solvent to remove ink and pen marks from surfaces. It is not typically used to remove peroxide, as peroxide is a chemical used for bleaching and disinfecting, and requires a different type of cleaning agent. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Prepare a wall to have a frameless mirror attached", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mark the location for the lower edge of the mirror on the face of the wall. Position one edge of a 4-foot level at the mark and adjust the level, as necessary, so the bubble is centered between the bubble lines. Mark a line across the face of the wall. (B) Mark the location for the lower edge of the mirror on the face of the wall. Position one edge of a 4-foot level at the mark and adjust the level, as necessary, so the bubble is on the right side between the bubble lines. Mark a line across the face of the wall.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it instructs to center the bubble between the bubble lines, which ensures that the level is perfectly horizontal. Option B instructs to only have the bubble on the right side between the bubble lines, which could result in an uneven placement of the mirror."}}
{"Q": "What size box should I use to make a lego batman costume?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) As long as it cover you chest. (B) You need on that covers the entire torso", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) You need one that covers the entire torso.\nExplanation: A Lego Batman costume typically consists of a blocky torso that resembles a Lego minifigure. To achieve this look, you will need a box that covers your entire torso, not just your chest. This will give you the proper proportions and shape for the costume. A box that only covers your chest would not be large enough to create the desired effect."}}
{"Q": "Add moisture to air.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dry wet clothes in dryer. (B) Hang wet clothes to dry inside home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Hang wet clothes to dry inside home.\nExplanation: Hanging wet clothes to dry inside the home can add moisture to the air as the water evaporates from the clothes. This is a more plausible answer than using a dryer, which actually removes moisture from the air as it dries the clothes."}}
{"Q": "metal bar", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) keeps out dastardly cat burglars from a store (B) keeps out small birds from a store", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: A metal bar would be more likely to keep out cat burglars, who are typically human-sized and capable of breaking into a store, rather than small birds who could easily fly in through an open window or door."}}
{"Q": "How do you dry nails fast after painting them?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fill a bowl with water and dry cubes. Submerge your nails in water for two to three minutes. (B) Fill a bowl with water and ice cubes. Submerge your nails in water for two to three minutes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Fill a bowl with water and ice cubes. Submerge your nails in water for two to three minutes.\nExplanation: The cold temperature of the water and ice cubes will help to set the nail polish faster, allowing it to dry more quickly. The water also helps to prevent smudging or smearing of the polish while it dries. However, it is important to note that this method may not work for all types of nail polish and may not be as effective as using a quick-drying topcoat."}}
{"Q": "spray paint", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) can mark up a thin sheet of paper with graffiti.  (B) can mark up a previously nice building with graffiti. ", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: While spray paint can technically mark up a thin sheet of paper with graffiti, it is much more likely to be used to mark up a building or other outdoor surface. Spray paint is often associated with graffiti and vandalism, and it is unfortunately common for people to use it to deface public property. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How do I open my garage", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Click the button for it to close, or punch in your code on the keypad (B) Click the button for it to open, or punch in your code on the keypad", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Click the button for it to open, or punch in your code on the keypad.\nExplanation: To open a garage, you need to click the button on the remote or the wall-mounted control panel to activate the motor that lifts the door. Alternatively, you can enter the correct code on the keypad to trigger the same mechanism. Clicking the button to close the garage door would not open it."}}
{"Q": "Carve words into wooden boards.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Take a piece of paper and write the word you want to carve on it. Hold the paper over a board and use a knife to trace along your word, carving it into the wood. (B) Take a piece of pipe and write the word you want to carve on it. Hold the pipe over a board and use a knife to trace along your word, carving it deeper into the pipe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it involves tracing the word onto the wooden board using a knife, which is a common method of carving. Option B involves using a pipe to trace the word, which is not a common tool for carving and may not produce the desired result. Additionally, carving deeper into a pipe would not result in a carved word on a wooden board."}}
{"Q": "ornament", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can decorate tree  (B) can decorate desk  ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Ornaments are traditionally used to decorate Christmas trees, making option A the more plausible choice.

{"Q": "container", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can store tin foil  (B) can cut tin foil ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible for a container to store tin foil rather than cut it. Containers are typically used for storage purposes, while cutting is a function that would require a specialized tool or device."}}
{"Q": "how do you eat boiled egg?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) just eat the egg itself. (B) cut off the white that is around the yolk and eat the yolk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) just eat the egg itself.\nExplanation: Boiled eggs are usually eaten whole, with the shell removed. The yolk and white are both consumed together, as they provide a good balance of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Cutting off the white around the yolk would result in missing out on some of the nutrients and flavor of the egg. Therefore, it is more plausible to just eat the egg itself."}}
{"Q": "Cut a piece of screen to cover a car window", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Place the screen on the window and trace around, cutting one to two inches smaller than the edge of the window, then ccut (B) Place the screen on the window and trace around, leaving one to two inches around the edge, then cut", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Place the screen on the window and trace around, cutting one to two inches smaller than the edge of the window, then cut.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because cutting the screen one to two inches smaller than the edge of the window will ensure that the screen fits snugly and securely on the window. Leaving one to two inches around the edge, as suggested in option B, may result in the screen being too loose and not providing adequate coverage."}}

Dress with olive oil and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. (B) Mix red onion slices, chopped cucumber, kalamata olive halves, dill and feta. Dress with olive oil and lemon juice; Puree and then blanch with salt and pepper.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mix red onion slices, chopped cucumber, kalamata olive halves, dill and feta. Dress with olive oil and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.\nExplanation: This recipe is a classic Greek cucumber salad recipe that is easy to make and requires simple ingredients. It is a refreshing and healthy salad that can be served as a side dish or a light meal. The combination of cucumber, red onion, kalamata olives, dill, and feta cheese creates a perfect balance of flavors and textures. The dressing made with olive oil and lemon juice adds a tangy and zesty flavor to the salad. Blending and blanching the salad as suggested in option B is not necessary and may alter the texture and taste of the salad."}}
{"Q": "Remove paper cover from a book.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put palm down on first page of book and with scissors cut the cover from the binding. Turn the book over and repeat. (B) Put palm down on first page of book and with your other hand slowly pull the cover from the binding. Turn the book over and repeat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer as it involves a gentler approach to removing the paper cover. Cutting the cover with scissors as suggested in option A may damage the binding or even cut into the pages of the book. Slowly pulling the cover from the binding as suggested in option B is a safer and more practical method."}}
{"Q": "To clean AirPods", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rub the AirPods with a soft, dry, lint-free cloth. Clean the microphone and speaker meshes with a dry cotton swab. Remove any debris from the meshes with a clean, dry, stiff-bristled brush. (B) Rub the AirPods with a soft, dry, lint-free cloth. Clean the microphone and speaker meshes with a dry cotton swab. Remove any debris from the meshes with a clean, dry, soft-bristled brush.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Using a stiff-bristled brush to remove debris from the meshes is more effective than using a soft-bristled brush. The stiff bristles can better dislodge any stubborn debris that may be stuck in the meshes. However, it is important to make sure the brush is clean and dry to avoid introducing any moisture or dirt to the AirPods."}}
{"Q": "Remove dents from carpet.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Let ice cream melt on dent, then pat dry. (B) Let ice cube melt on dent, then pat dry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Let ice cube melt on dent, then pat dry.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the cold temperature of the ice cube will cause the carpet fibers to contract, which can help to lift the dent. Once the ice cube has melted, the fibers should be more pliable and easier to manipulate back into place. Patting the area dry will help to remove any excess moisture and prevent mold or mildew from forming. Letting ice cream melt on the dent is not a practical solution as it will leave a sticky residue that will be difficult to clean."}}
{"Q": "how do you tip a hat?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) move it forward and downward slightly. (B) move it forward and upward slightly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. move it forward and downward slightly.\nExplanation: Tipping a hat is a gesture of respect or greeting. To do it properly, one should move the hat forward and downward slightly, as if acknowledging the person in front of them. Moving the hat upward would not be a natural gesture and may be interpreted as rude or insincere. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "How do you light a match?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) quickly run the black end over the matchbox to ignite it. (B) dip it onto asphalt for 2 seconds and it should ignite.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: To light a match, you need to quickly run the black end over the matchbox to ignite it. This is because the black end of the match contains a small amount of phosphorus, which ignites when it comes into contact with the striking surface on the matchbox. By quickly running the black end over the striking surface, you create enough friction and heat to ignite the phosphorus and light the match. Dipping it onto asphalt for 2 seconds is not a plausible answer as asphalt is not a suitable surface for igniting matches and it would take longer than 2 seconds to ignite the match."}}
{"Q": "How to make Strawberry Kiwi Sauce at home.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Boil 1 cup Kiwi (chopped), 1 cup chopped strawberries  with 3/4 cup water and  1 cup Olive pits for 30 min., stirring to keep from scorching over med. heat on the stove top. (B) Boil 1 cup Kiwi (chopped), 1 cup chopped strawberries  with 3/4 cup water and  1 cup sugar for 30 min., stirring to keep from scorching over med. heat on the stove top.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Boiling the fruits with sugar is a more common method for making fruit sauce as it helps to sweeten and thicken the sauce. Boiling with olive pits in option A is not necessary and may not be safe for consumption."}}
{"Q": "magazine", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can be ruined if they get wet by a mop  (B) can be ruined if they get wet by a jar ", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a magazine can be ruined if it gets wet by a mop, as mops are typically used for cleaning and can be wet and dirty. On the other hand, it is less likely that a magazine would be near a jar that is filled with enough liquid to ruin it."}}
{"Q": "how do you make a copy of a key?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) take the key to walmart and go to the auto center. have them make you a copy. (B) cut out a piece of metal in the same shape of your key.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Taking the key to a store like Walmart or a locksmith is the most common and reliable way to make a copy of a key.

{"Q": "to store cast iron pans so they stay dry", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) store with old rags or beach towels between them (B) store with old rags or paper towel between them", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Storing cast iron pans with old rags or beach towels between them is a more plausible answer as it allows for air circulation and prevents moisture buildup, which can lead to rust. Paper towels may not be as effective in absorbing moisture and may leave behind fibers that can stick to the pans. Beach towels or old rags are also more sustainable options as they can be washed and reused."}}
{"Q": "a sponge", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) can clean a car properly (B) can clean teeth properly", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: A sponge is commonly used for cleaning surfaces such as cars, dishes, and countertops.

(B) Find old newspaper or tissue paper from Christmas. Cut them with scissors until you have a full bucket of tiny paper pieces.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Find old newspaper or tissue paper from Christmas. Cut them with scissors until you have a full bucket of tiny paper pieces.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because newspaper and tissue paper are commonly used for papier mache and are easily accessible. Cardboard boxes may be too thick and difficult to cut into small pieces. Additionally, using paper from Christmas may be a good way to repurpose old decorations."}}
{"Q": "How many legs do you need for a coffee table.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) You need five legs (B) You need four legs", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. You need four legs.\nExplanation: A coffee table typically has four legs to provide stability and balance. Adding a fifth leg would not only be unnecessary but could also make the table wobbly. Therefore, four legs are the most plausible and practical option for a coffee table."}}
{"Q": "To design a exercise routine for the lower body you can do at home.", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Do squats and lunges while holding the phones. (B) Do squats and lunges while holding the dumbbells.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Doing squats and lunges while holding the phones is a more plausible answer as most people have phones readily available at home, whereas not everyone may have dumbbells. Additionally, holding the phones can still provide some resistance and weight to the exercise, making it effective for building lower body strength."}}
{"Q": "Learn to make my own condiment buffet for BBQ's.", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scour yard sales and pick up an old muffin tin and use it for all of your condiments like, mustard, ketchup, mayo, bbq sauce, dips and whatever you need in a small quantity.

Scour yard sales and pick up an old muffin tin and use it for all of your condiments like, mustard, ketchup, mayo, bbq sauce, dips and whatever you need in a small quantity.\nExplanation: Using a muffin tin for a condiment buffet is a practical and easy solution. The individual compartments can hold different condiments, making it easy for guests to choose what they want. It's also easy to clean and can be reused for future BBQs. Using an old shoe for condiments is not a hygienic or practical option."}}
{"Q": "How can I easily carry clothes on hangers when I move?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Take a couple of full heavy duty clothes hangers, then hook several hangers of clothes on Those hangers and carry them all at once. (B) Take a couple of empty heavy duty clothes hangers, then hook several hangers of clothes on Those hangers and carry them all at once.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Take a couple of empty heavy duty clothes hangers, then hook several hangers of clothes on those hangers and carry them all at once.\nExplanation: Taking a couple of empty heavy duty clothes hangers and hooking several hangers of clothes on them is a more plausible answer as it reduces the weight of the load being carried.

Once the mixture begins to simmer, remove from the heat and add the chocolate and caramel sauce.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Bringing the milk and cream to a simmer on a low-medium heat will ensure that the mixture is hot enough to melt the chocolate and caramel sauce. Adding the chocolate and caramel sauce once the mixture begins to simmer will allow them to melt and blend in with the milk and cream. Removing from the heat will prevent the mixture from boiling and potentially curdling. Chopping the chocolate into small chunks will also help it melt more easily."}}
