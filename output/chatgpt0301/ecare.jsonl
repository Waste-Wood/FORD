{"Q": "The child brought psycho-physical phenomena on a new life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The woman gave birth to a child. (B) The baby feels the awareness through physical sensations.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the child is experiencing psycho-physical phenomena, which means that the child is experiencing a connection between the mind and body. This connection is likely due to the baby's ability to feel physical sensations and become aware of them, leading to the development of psycho-physical phenomena. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not a direct cause of psycho-physical phenomena and does not explain how the child is experiencing this phenomenon."}}
{"Q": "Otters enter their new habitat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Otters start looking for abalone for food. (B) They always live by the water so that they can drink water easily.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Otters start looking for abalone for food.\nExplanation: Otters are known to be carnivorous and their diet mainly consists of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks like abalone. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would start looking for abalone for food in their new habitat rather than just living by the water for easy access to drinking water."}}
{"Q": "Lila can find what she wants quickly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lila bought several kinds of textbooks. (B) Lila loves classification of her things.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because loving classification of her things would make Lila more organized and able to find what she wants quickly. Buying several kinds of textbooks (A) does not necessarily relate to Lila's ability to find things quickly."}}
{"Q": "The chance she gets flu becomes smaller. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fish has suffered from the infection. (B) She has been vaccined.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that she has been vaccinated. Vaccination is a preventive measure against flu, which reduces the chance of getting infected. Option A is not a plausible answer as the fish suffering from an infection does not have any direct relation to the woman's chance of getting flu."}}
{"Q": "He got some rum. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The worker fremented some sugar cane with yeast. (B) Tom went out and want to hunt some cottontails.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The worker fermented some sugar cane with yeast.\nExplanation: Rum is typically made by fermenting sugar cane with yeast, so it is more plausible that the cause of him getting rum was due to someone fermenting sugar cane with yeast rather than Tom going out to hunt cottontails."}}
{"Q": "Grande opened the drawers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The red blood flew out. (B) He saw his old clothing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He saw his old clothing.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because opening drawers typically results in seeing what is inside them, such as clothing. The option of blood flying out seems unlikely and out of context."}}
{"Q": "He will not withstand the dry climate there. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack's farm experienced a drought this year. (B) He wants to travel the Sahara desert.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jack's farm experienced a drought this year.\nExplanation: The statement mentions a dry climate, which is typically caused by a lack of rainfall. Option A suggests that Jack's farm experienced a drought, which would have resulted in a dry climate. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Jack wants to travel the Sahara desert, which is already known for its dry climate, so it does not explain why he would not be able to withstand it. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Black's sweat always drips into his eyes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Black pulled out his eyelashes for beauty. (B) Black doesn't like sleeping.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Black doesn't like sleeping.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Black's sweat drips into his eyes because he doesn't like sleeping, which could cause him to sweat more due to exhaustion or stress. Pulling out his eyelashes for beauty seems like an unlikely cause for this issue."}}
{"Q": "Racing drivers will encounter common dangers from time to time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Smoking will inhale nicotine. (B) There are many obstacles on the track.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Racing drivers will encounter common dangers from time to time because there are many obstacles on the track, such as sharp turns, other cars, debris, and changing weather conditions. These obstacles can cause accidents and injuries, making racing a dangerous sport. While smoking may have negative health effects on drivers, it is not a direct cause of the dangers they face on the track."}}
{"Q": "The bar asks a businessman for help. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a serious financial crisis in Australia. (B) The bar wants to devise some tests.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There was a serious financial crisis in Australia.\nExplanation: The bar asking a businessman for help suggests that they are facing financial difficulties. Option A is the most plausible answer as it directly addresses the financial crisis in Australia, which could have affected the bar's business. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear reason for why the bar would need to devise tests and how a businessman could help with that."}}
{"Q": "Lily has taken some sulfonamedes to make hemolysis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The medicine didn't work. (B) Lily has been killed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Sulfonamides are antibiotics that work by inhibiting the growth of bacteria. They do not cause hemolysis, which is the destruction of red blood cells. Therefore, it is unlikely that Lily's taking sulfonamides would result in hemolysis or death. It is possible that Lily was prescribed sulfonamides for a different condition and her hemolysis was caused by another factor."}}
{"Q": "It cannot produce oxygen. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's experiment produced some methanol gas. (B) No energy is available for the dying plant anymore.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the plant is dying, which means it is not able to carry out photosynthesis anymore. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants produce oxygen, and it requires energy from sunlight. If the plant is dying, it means it is not able to produce enough energy to carry out photosynthesis, which is why it cannot produce oxygen. Choice A, which suggests that Tom's experiment produced some methanol gas, is not relevant to the statement and does not explain why the plant cannot produce oxygen."}}
{"Q": "Tom has good eyesight. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom found the poisonous snake in time. (B) Tom pays great attention to eye protection.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Tom has good eyesight, he was able to spot the poisonous snake in time and avoid any potential danger. It is not necessarily related to paying attention to eye protection."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to know more about production. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bought a soda. (B) Tom set out to go to the dense regions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom set out to go to the dense regions.\nExplanation: Since Tom wants to know more about production, it is more plausible that he would seek out information or resources related to production. Going to the dense regions could potentially provide him with access to factories or other production facilities where he could observe and learn about the production process. Buying a soda, on the other hand, is not directly related to learning about production and seems like an unlikely response to his desire for more information."}}
{"Q": "He observed tracks on the ground where the jaguar had moved its all tour legs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The neighbor gave Tom a saguaro. (B) The zoologist made an observation of the jaguar's habits.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The zoologist made an observation of the jaguar's habits.\nExplanation: The observation of tracks on the ground where the jaguar had moved its all four legs suggests that the zoologist made an observation of the jaguar's habits. It is unlikely that receiving a saguaro from a neighbor would cause a jaguar to move in such a way. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has established a community to help those homeless children. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many of her friends join in the warm-hearted family. (B) It needs a lot of people to explore it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it suggests that Lucy's friends were inspired by her initiative and joined her in helping the homeless children. This is a common occurrence when someone takes the lead in doing something good, and it creates a ripple effect that encourages others to get involved. Option B, on the other hand, is not as likely as it suggests that the community needs a lot of people to explore it, which doesn't make sense in the context of helping homeless children."}}
{"Q": "Scientists avoid great impact of atoms. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The abuse of nuclear power is terrifying. (B) He was studying atoms.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The abuse of nuclear power is terrifying because it can lead to catastrophic consequences such as nuclear explosions and radiation poisoning. Therefore, scientists take great precautions to avoid any potential impact of atoms."}}
{"Q": "As he walked, he felt much heavier than before. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mr. Howard was going to hiking who had a big bag on his back. (B) Jack had stomach cramps.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Mr. Howard was going hiking and had a big bag on his back, which would make him feel heavier as he walked. Option B, Jack having stomach cramps, would not necessarily make him feel physically heavier."}}
{"Q": "He obserevd the growth of the embryo inside the seed at first. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He observed the process from germination of seeds to eventually maturation of plants. (B) Jack nurtures a newborn jackdaw.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The observation of the growth of the embryo inside the seed suggests that the focus was on the early stages of plant development, specifically from the point of seed germination. Option B, which refers to the nurturing of a jackdaw, is not relevant to the given statement."}}
{"Q": "After the financial crisis, the suicide rate increased significantly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The financial crisis left many people homeless. (B) Time goes on.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The financial crisis left many people homeless, jobless, and struggling to make ends meet. This led to increased stress, anxiety, and depression, which are known risk factors for suicide. Additionally, the loss of financial security and the feeling of hopelessness about the future may have contributed to the increase in suicide rates. Studies have shown a correlation between economic downturns and increased suicide rates, highlighting the devastating impact of financial crises on mental health."}}
{"Q": "They often exchange their own privileges. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The two competitors became friends of reciprocity. (B) Audrey and her friends take part in group trips.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The phrase \"exchange their own privileges\" suggests that the two competitors are giving up something they have in order to gain something from the other person. This type of behavior is often seen in reciprocal relationships, where individuals help each other out in order to receive help in return. Therefore, it is more plausible that the two competitors became friends of reciprocity, rather than the unrelated fact that Audrey and her friends take part in group trips."}}
{"Q": "Mary read some papers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She made many mistakes because of her frets. (B) She knew lots of details.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She knew lots of details.\nExplanation: Since Mary read some papers, it is likely that she gained knowledge and information from them, leading to her knowing lots of details. Option A is less plausible as it assumes that Mary was anxious or worried (frets) while reading, which is not mentioned in the question."}}
{"Q": "Sam wished to eat stew for supper. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He never eats junk food. (B) Sam's wife went to buy some meat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Sam's wife went to buy some meat.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Sam's desire to eat stew for supper. If Sam never eats junk food, it is not relevant to his desire for stew. However, if Sam's wife went to buy some meat, it suggests that they will be able to make the stew and fulfill Sam's wish for supper."}}
{"Q": "It's half way through autumn. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It has difficulty in running. (B) It rains more in half autumn than in spring and summer combined.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It rains more in half autumn than in spring and summer combined.\nExplanation: Autumn is typically associated with cooler temperatures and increased precipitation. As the season progresses, the amount of rainfall tends to increase, leading to more rainy days and potentially even flooding in some areas. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of being halfway through autumn would be an increase in rainfall rather than any difficulty in running."}}
{"Q": "The major planets interact. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is gravity among the planets. (B) There is magnetic force among the planets.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There is gravity among the planets.\nExplanation: The major planets in our solar system interact with each other through the force of gravity. This gravitational force is what keeps the planets in their orbits around the sun and also causes them to influence each other's orbits. For example, the gravitational pull of Jupiter affects the orbits of other planets in the solar system. Magnetic force, on the other hand, is not a significant factor in the interactions between planets."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a civet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The civet sleeps a lot. (B) The civet eats the fish quickly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The civet sleeps a lot.\nExplanation: Civets are nocturnal animals and are known to sleep for long periods during the day. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's civet would sleep a lot rather than eat fish quickly."}}
{"Q": "Alice likes the smell of milk. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She always eats cakes with a lot of cream. (B) She made some perfume.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alice's liking for the smell of milk would lead her to eat cakes with a lot of cream, as opposed to making perfume. Eating cakes with cream would allow her to enjoy the smell of milk in a more practical and enjoyable way, while making perfume would require more effort and resources."}}
{"Q": "Jack wanted to know why Quasars drown out the light from all the other stars in the same galaxy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He took use of stoichimetry. (B) He looked it up and found out that it was because they were so bright.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Jack most likely researched the topic and found out that Quasars are extremely bright and emit a large amount of energy, which can drown out the light from other stars in the same galaxy. Stoichiometry, which is a branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of quantities of substances involved in chemical reactions, would not be relevant in this situation. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Simon's mother often let Simon eat soys. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Simon grows healthy. (B) Simon is often sick.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Soy is a good source of protein and other nutrients, so it is likely that Simon grew healthy as a result of eating it often."}}
{"Q": "A factory produces several tons of tissues from straws. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are physically stronger. (B) The quality of these tissues is different.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the quality of the tissues is different as a result of using straws as the raw material. Straws are not typically used in tissue production, so it is likely that the properties of the tissues would be affected by this change in material. Additionally, the use of straws may introduce impurities or other factors that could impact the quality of the final product."}}
{"Q": "Jack added nitrites into the water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The catfish died earlier than the scalefish in the water. (B) The scalefish died earlier than the catfish in the water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The scalefish died earlier than the catfish in the water.\nExplanation: Nitrites are toxic to fish and can cause oxygen deprivation, leading to death. However, different species of fish have different tolerances to nitrites. Catfish are generally more tolerant to nitrites than scalefish, so it is more likely that the scalefish would die earlier than the catfish in water with added nitrites."}}
{"Q": "His action led to the movement of the wheels. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The machine was set in motion. (B) The second step followed it soon after.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The machine was set in motion.\nExplanation: Since the action led to the movement of the wheels, it is logical to assume that the machine was set in motion as a result. Choice B, \"The second step followed it soon after,\" does not necessarily follow from the given information and is not as directly related to the action of the wheels moving."}}
{"Q": "Jack's interest is to study human species. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He decides to choose anthropology as his major in college. (B) Jack's company mainly uses nanotechnology.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Since Jack's interest is to study human species, anthropology would be the most relevant field of study for him. It focuses on the study of human societies, cultures, and their development. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would choose anthropology as his major in college. Option B, which mentions Jack's company using nanotechnology, is not related to his interest in studying human species."}}
{"Q": "Father of our religion combined a union of opposite tenets. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It accepted diverse cultures. (B) His action of syncretism was praised.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: By combining opposite tenets, the father of our religion created a belief system that was able to accept and incorporate diverse cultures. This allowed for the religion to spread and adapt to different regions and peoples, making it more inclusive and accessible. While his action of syncretism may have been praised by some, the more significant outcome was the acceptance of diverse cultures within the religion."}}
{"Q": "Various features show that this is a dicot in the family Piperaceae. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This seed is a monocot rather than dicot. (B) Researchers suspected it is a peperomia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the plant in question has features that are characteristic of dicots in the family Piperaceae. Therefore, it is unlikely that the seed is a monocot. Instead, researchers may suspect that it belongs to the genus Peperomia, which is a common member of the Piperaceae family and includes many dicot species."}}
{"Q": "Tom has measured the magnetism of the material. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The result reached nearly four feet. (B) It is 15 gammas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It is 15 gammas.\nExplanation: The sentence only mentions that Tom measured the magnetism of the material, but it does not provide any information about the measurement result reaching nearly four feet. Therefore, option (A) is not a plausible answer. On the other hand, the sentence states that Tom measured the magnetism, which resulted in a value of 15 gammas. Hence, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom studied the types of polypropylene. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found that they came in five types. (B) He found that they came in two types.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He found that they came in five types.\nExplanation: Polypropylene is a thermoplastic polymer that can be produced in different types based on its molecular structure and properties. It is more likely that Tom found that there are five types of polypropylene rather than just two, as there are several factors that can affect the classification of polypropylene types, such as the method of production, the presence of additives, and the intended use. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The source of the mud was investigated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was reported that the soil source was very rich. (B) It was reported that the soil source was very dry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It was reported that the soil source was very rich.\nExplanation: If the source of the mud was investigated, it is more likely that the investigators would report on the quality of the soil rather than its dryness. Additionally, if the mud was thick and sticky, it would suggest that the soil was rich in clay and organic matter, which would make it more likely for the mud to form. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The student feel anxious to take the exam. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They choose to watch porn online. (B) Her teacher gave her a warm smile.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Her teacher gave her a warm smile.\nExplanation: It is highly unlikely that feeling anxious about an exam would lead someone to watch porn online. On the other hand, receiving a warm smile from a teacher can help alleviate anxiety and provide reassurance, which could help the student feel more confident and prepared for the exam."}}
{"Q": "This charity donates money to Asian areas with famine. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Some people western india were hungry. (B) Some people western india were helped.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Some people in western India were helped.\nExplanation: Since the charity donates money to Asian areas with famine, it is likely that the money was used to provide aid and assistance to those in need in the affected areas. Therefore, it is more plausible that some people in western India were helped rather than becoming hungry as a result of the charity's actions."}}
{"Q": "The state has launched a policy of collusion. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The government is aware of the importance of children's health for the future of the country and wants to reduce child mortality. (B) The state began to crack down on competitive economic activities in an all-round way.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The government is aware of the importance of children's health for the future of the country and wants to reduce child mortality.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it aligns with the government's responsibility to prioritize the health and well-being of its citizens, especially children who are the future of the country. Collusion, which refers to secret cooperation between individuals or organizations for illegal or unethical purposes, would not be an appropriate policy for cracking down on economic activities. Additionally, reducing child mortality is a common goal for many governments around the world, and implementing policies to achieve this goal is a responsible and ethical approach."}}
{"Q": "Tom improved his learning efficiency today. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Now he is proficient in giving a presentation. (B) He finished all his homework ahead of schedule.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: The statement mentions that Tom improved his learning efficiency, which means he was able to learn and complete tasks more quickly and effectively. Option B, which states that he finished all his homework ahead of schedule, is a more plausible result of improved learning efficiency than option A, which suggests he is now proficient in giving a presentation."}}
{"Q": "Tom cut the rind of the watermelon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to take pictures with the watermelon. (B) Tom wants to eat watermelon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tom cut the rind of the watermelon because he wants to eat it. The rind is not typically consumed and needs to be removed before eating the fruit inside. While it is possible that Tom may want to take pictures with the watermelon, it is not a common reason for cutting the rind."}}
{"Q": "Tom has observed charge movement. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom give the circuit voltage. (B) Tom has bought a mayfly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Charge movement in a circuit is caused by the application of voltage, so choice A is the more plausible answer. Choice B, buying a mayfly, has no relation to charge movement in a circuit."}}
{"Q": "This child caught roseola. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He succeeded via conjuring up a flower. (B) The child had a fever which followed by a rash.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The child had a fever which followed by a rash.\nExplanation: Roseola is a viral illness that commonly affects young children. It typically starts with a high fever for several days, followed by a rash that appears once the fever breaks. Conjuring up a flower has no relation to the symptoms of roseola. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This phenomenon is called speciation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists say that many species have become extinct since ancient times. (B) A species gradually adapted to its environment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. A species gradually adapted to its environment.\nExplanation: Speciation occurs when a population of a species gradually adapts to its environment over time, leading to the development of new traits and characteristics that eventually result in the formation of a new species. This process can occur through natural selection, genetic drift, or other mechanisms that cause genetic variation and divergence within a population. While extinction can also contribute to changes in species diversity over time, it is not the direct cause of speciation."}}
{"Q": "He found out that cytokines worked in it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was studying how body temperature rises. (B) The scientist testing lipoproteins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions cytokines, which are signaling molecules involved in the immune response. Lipoproteins are often studied in relation to the immune system, so it is more likely that the scientist testing lipoproteins would discover the role of cytokines in the process. Tom's study on body temperature does not necessarily relate to cytokines."}}
{"Q": "Now it's time to remove the drugs from the patient's body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor uses the method of plasmapheresis to treat him. (B) Various elimination processes was adopted to achieve that.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Various elimination processes such as metabolism, excretion, and detoxification are commonly used to remove drugs from the patient's body. Plasmapheresis is a method of removing plasma from the blood, which may be used in certain cases, but it is not a common method for drug elimination. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He successfully solved the problem. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He cannot solve the problem from start to finish. (B) He has a clear understanding of this problem.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If he successfully solved the problem, it means he has a clear understanding of the problem and was able to find a solution. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it contradicts the statement that he successfully solved the problem."}}
{"Q": "The villagers were happy about the harvest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They responded with a public press. (B) They had enough food this year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They had enough food this year.\nExplanation: It is common for villagers to be happy about a good harvest because it means they will have enough food to sustain themselves for the year. It is unlikely that they would respond with a public press as it is not a common practice in rural areas. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The lecturer is talking about t lymphocytes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I can hear blindness sometimes. (B) I can hear t-cells sometimes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I can hear t-cells sometimes.\nExplanation: The lecturer is specifically talking about t lymphocytes, which are also known as t-cells. Therefore, it is more plausible that the listener would hear \"t-cells\" rather than \"blindness.\""}}
{"Q": "He found the pyridine disappeared. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor traced the sources of this toxin. (B) The scientist put some pyridine in the water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the pyridine disappeared unexpectedly, which implies that it was not intentionally removed or added by someone. Therefore, option A, which suggests that the disappearance was caused by a toxin, is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests that the scientist added the pyridine to the water."}}
{"Q": "Amy served as an assistant in this company. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy is good at services work. (B) She is hired by a potent company for her potential to make interest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The given information does not provide any indication that Amy was hired by another company or that she had the potential to make interest. The only information provided is that she served as an assistant in the company, which suggests that she has experience in service work. Therefore, it is more plausible to assume that Amy is good at service work."}}
{"Q": "Human might get infected owing to sick mosquitoes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Harmful bacteria can make people sick. (B) Virus attacked the mosquitoes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Harmful bacteria can make people sick.\nExplanation: Mosquitoes can carry harmful bacteria such as those that cause diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus. When a mosquito bites a person, it can transmit these bacteria into the person's bloodstream, causing them to become sick. While viruses can also be transmitted by mosquitoes, bacterial infections are more common and can have serious health consequences."}}
{"Q": "It is difficult for him to get mind equilibrium now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Henry always runs into hindrances in doing business. (B) He suffers from epilepsy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Henry is having difficulty achieving mind equilibrium, which suggests that he is experiencing some level of stress or anxiety. Option A provides a more plausible explanation for this, as running into hindrances in business can be a significant source of stress and frustration. Option B, while a valid medical condition, is not mentioned in the statement and therefore cannot be assumed to be the cause of Henry's current state."}}
{"Q": "The school will hold a ceremony the day after tomorrow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The school will hold a simulation in advance tomorrow. (B) The school takes no behaviors.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The school takes no behaviors.\nExplanation: There is no indication in the statement that the school needs to take any actions before the ceremony. Therefore, it is more plausible that the school will simply hold the ceremony on the scheduled day without any additional preparations or simulations."}}
{"Q": "Tom has taken use of two pieces of magnets to make his experiment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are dextrorotary and levorotary. (B) He has proved something about the attraction.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement about the magnets being dextrorotary and levorotary does not make sense in this context. Therefore, option B is more plausible as it suggests that Tom has conducted an experiment to prove something about the attraction between the magnets. However, the specific details of the experiment and its results are not provided in the question."}}
{"Q": "Tom takes use of a thermostat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The small chicken shoud be incubated under the same temperature. (B) Tom always catches a cold.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The use of a thermostat is commonly associated with maintaining a consistent temperature for incubating eggs or other small animals. Option A suggests that Tom is using the thermostat for this purpose, while option B is not a likely reason for using a thermostat."}}
{"Q": "She cannot have contact with dough. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy has constipation. (B) She is allergic to yeast.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She is allergic to yeast.\nExplanation: If someone is allergic to yeast, they cannot have contact with dough as it contains yeast. On the other hand, constipation is not related to having contact with dough. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The workers have no idea about how to operate the computer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their teacher told them the answer was limestone. (B) The leader taught them in person.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The leader taught them in person.\nExplanation: Since the workers have no idea about how to operate the computer, it is likely that they needed someone to teach them in person. Option A is irrelevant and does not provide a logical explanation for the workers' lack of knowledge about computer operation. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The patient with fibroadenomas read his report of mammography. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was in relief for its benign appearance. (B) They collect many fibres.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He was in relief for its benign appearance.\nExplanation: Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors that are commonly found in young women. The patient would be relieved to know that the mammography report showed a benign appearance, indicating that the fibroadenomas are not cancerous. Option B, \"They collect many fibres,\" is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the diagnosis or the patient's reaction to the report."}}
{"Q": "The children will be shipped off to a boarding school. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their parents taught their children how to solve living problems independently before going to school. (B) Various elimination processes was adopted to achieve that.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Their parents taught their children how to solve living problems independently before going to school.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the parents would prepare their children for independent living before sending them off to boarding school, rather than subjecting them to various elimination processes. Teaching children how to solve living problems independently would help them adjust better to the new environment and be more self-sufficient."}}
{"Q": "He went to school. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He learned a lot. (B) He was good at social interaction.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He learned a lot.\nExplanation: Going to school is primarily for the purpose of learning and gaining knowledge. While social interaction is also a part of the school experience, it is not the main outcome. Therefore, it is more plausible that he learned a lot as a result of going to school."}}
{"Q": "The workers are in charge of cleaning debris. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They have to consider the waste. (B) Tom brings a clean dry rag and start cleaning the dirty floor .", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They have to consider the waste.\nExplanation: Since the workers are in charge of cleaning debris, they would have to consider the type of waste they are cleaning up and dispose of it properly. This is a logical consequence of their responsibility to clean up debris. Option B is not a plausible answer as it introduces a new character and action that is not related to the original statement."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said that his heart rhythm is uneven. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack's infusion speed was uneven. (B) He asked the cardiologist to watch the condition of the heart.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jack's infusion speed was uneven.\nExplanation: Uneven infusion speed can cause fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate, leading to an irregular heart rhythm. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests that the doctor's request to monitor his heart caused the irregular rhythm, which is unlikely."}}
{"Q": "Enzymes are necessary for children's growth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Then kids can grow taller. (B) Children are encouraged to eat sprouts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Enzymes are necessary for the breakdown and absorption of nutrients, which are essential for growth and development. Therefore, if children have sufficient enzymes, they can effectively utilize the nutrients from their food, leading to proper growth and potentially increased height. However, it is important to note that genetics and other factors also play a significant role in determining a child's height."}}
{"Q": "Parliament is a place of justice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My father really wants individual liberty and individual responsibility. (B) The house of the people holds justice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Parliament is the legislative body that represents the people and creates laws that uphold justice. It is made up of elected officials who are responsible for ensuring that the laws are fair and just for all citizens. Therefore, it is more plausible that the house of the people holds justice rather than an individual's personal beliefs about liberty and responsibility."}}
{"Q": "The man devoted himself to journalism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He mastered the popular language used in pursuit of truth. (B) He became fatter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He mastered the popular language used in pursuit of truth.\nExplanation: Devoting oneself to journalism requires a lot of reading, writing, and communication with people from different backgrounds. As a result, the man likely became proficient in the language commonly used in journalism to effectively communicate and report on the truth. Becoming fatter is not a logical consequence of devoting oneself to journalism."}}
{"Q": "He said he got a ladybug. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom went to the zoo. (B) Tom found a small dome-shaped beetle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because ladybugs are small dome-shaped beetles, so it is likely that Tom found a ladybug while looking for beetles. Option A, going to the zoo, does not have any connection to finding a ladybug."}}
{"Q": "The primates didn't want to be exhibit animals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They escaped from the zoo. (B) They ran to the dianosaurs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They escaped from the zoo.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the primates would try to escape from the zoo rather than run to the dinosaurs, which are extinct. Primates are intelligent animals and have been known to escape from zoos in the past. Additionally, the statement explicitly states that the primates did not want to be exhibit animals, which would give them a strong motivation to try to escape."}}
{"Q": "The root of the plant rotted. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) In order to save the plant, Tom gave it a rhizoid. (B) The plants were beginning to wilt.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the root of the plant rotted, it means that the plant is no longer able to absorb water and nutrients from the soil. As a result, the plant will begin to wilt and eventually die if not treated. Giving the plant a rhizoid (which is a type of root-like structure) would not necessarily save it, as the plant may still be unable to absorb water and nutrients without a healthy root system."}}
{"Q": "Tom was a shepherd. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He took care of a flock of sheep. (B) I respected his extensive observations.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He took care of a flock of sheep.\nExplanation: Since Tom was a shepherd, it is most likely that he took care of a flock of sheep. Shepherds are responsible for the well-being and management of sheep, so it is reasonable to assume that Tom's job involved tending to a group of sheep. Option B, on the other hand, does not necessarily follow from the fact that Tom was a shepherd. While it is possible that Tom made extensive observations as part of his job, this is not a direct consequence of being a shepherd."}}
{"Q": "Tom feels that his asthma is about to attack. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was injected with some water. (B) He eats some singulars.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the given choices are plausible. \nExplanation: When someone feels that their asthma is about to attack, they typically use their inhaler or other prescribed medication to prevent or alleviate the symptoms. Injecting water or eating singulars would not be effective in treating asthma and could potentially be harmful. It is important to follow a doctor's instructions and have a plan in place for managing asthma attacks."}}
{"Q": "But the students can't understand the example. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher gives an example to illustrate the grammar point. (B) Researchers are debating.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The cause of the students not understanding the example is that the teacher gave an example to illustrate the grammar point, but it was not clear or effective enough for the students to comprehend."}}
{"Q": "The scientist observed its appearance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nobody has seen edaphosauruses before. (B) A scientist has picked up a paramecium and curious about it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Nobody has seen edaphosauruses before.\nExplanation: The observation of the appearance of edaphosauruses suggests that they were not previously known or observed by scientists. Option B, which mentions a paramecium, is unrelated to the observation of edaphosauruses."}}
{"Q": "All relatives entered the family room. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their ages ranged from 20 to 50 years old. (B) They sat on the chairs one by one.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They sat on the chairs one by one.\nExplanation: The sentence states that all relatives entered the family room, which implies that they were standing or not in the family room before. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would sit on chairs rather than have their ages ranging from 20 to 50 years old as that information is not relevant to the context."}}
{"Q": "There are many people, among which part of them are with normal sight and part of them are blind. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their disability can be rated by following a continuum. (B) Normal people can see everything and blind people are in a dark world without any light.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that there are people with normal sight and people who are blind, indicating a range of visual abilities. Therefore, it is more plausible to say that their disability can be rated by following a continuum, rather than assuming that normal people can see everything and blind people are in complete darkness. This continuum could include varying degrees of visual impairment, from mild to severe, and may also take into account other factors such as color blindness or visual processing disorders."}}
{"Q": "The wine must be kept from becoming flabby. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The alcohol worked. (B) Acidity should be used.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Acidity should be used. This is because acidity helps to balance the sweetness in wine and prevent it from becoming flabby or overly sweet. The use of alcohol alone may not be enough to prevent flabbiness in wine."}}
{"Q": "Tom ran into an anemone. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Spontaneous ignition occurred. (B) He was poisoned.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He was poisoned.\nExplanation: Anemones are known to have stinging cells called nematocysts that can release toxins when triggered. If Tom ran into an anemone, it is likely that he was stung and experienced some level of poisoning. Spontaneous ignition, on the other hand, is not a plausible result of running into an anemone."}}
{"Q": "The company loses one million due to rust after a few months. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The company keeps the steel in a wet warehouse. (B) Qualcomm Company has applied for many patents.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Rust is caused by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of moisture. Therefore, keeping steel in a wet warehouse would increase the likelihood of rust forming on the steel. This is a more plausible explanation than the unrelated fact that Qualcomm Company has applied for many patents."}}
{"Q": "Mary ate lots of chocolate. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She also intook theobromine. (B) She eats more nutritious food than before.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) She also intook theobromine.\nExplanation: Chocolate contains theobromine, a stimulant that can affect the central nervous system and cause various symptoms such as increased heart rate, restlessness, and even seizures in extreme cases. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mary also ingested theobromine along with the chocolate she ate. Option (B) is less likely as there is no indication that Mary's chocolate consumption led to a change in her overall diet."}}
{"Q": "Farmers do not use softwoods as firewoods. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tracheilds are not suitable to be used as fire materials. (B) Tom went into the farm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Softwoods, such as pine and spruce, have a high resin content which causes them to burn quickly and produce a lot of smoke. This makes them unsuitable for use as firewood as they do not provide a sustained heat source and can be harmful to breathe in the smoke. Hardwoods, such as oak and maple, are preferred for firewood as they burn slower and produce less smoke. Therefore, choice A is the more plausible answer. Choice B is irrelevant and does not provide a logical explanation for why farmers do not use softwoods as firewood."}}
{"Q": "The field was very quiet at night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Suddenly it began to rain. (B) The silence was broken by several bird calls.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The silence was broken by several bird calls.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is common for birds to be more active and vocal at night, especially during mating season. Rain is not necessarily a common occurrence just because it is quiet at night."}}
{"Q": "It died. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The possum has eaten an ill bird. (B) The fish has suffered from the infection.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The choice B is more plausible as fish are known to be susceptible to infections and can die from them. On the other hand, it is unlikely for a possum to eat an ill bird and die from it."}}
{"Q": "He served as an accountant in this company. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got a copy of the contract. (B) He worked hard to manage the balance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since he served as an accountant, it is more plausible that he worked hard to manage the balance of the company's finances. Getting a copy of the contract may not necessarily be related to his job as an accountant."}}
{"Q": "Lyle's doctor treated him with a laser. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lyle has ophthalmologist. (B) Logan got bone cancer and his osteocytes lost the function of secreting enzymes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The use of a laser in medical treatment is commonly associated with ophthalmology, which deals with eye-related issues. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lyle's doctor is an ophthalmologist and treated him with a laser for an eye-related condition. Option B is not related to the use of a laser in medical treatment and is therefore an unlikely explanation."}}
{"Q": "This experiment requires a gray-white solid with a shiny surface. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It is not worth seeing grays. (B) The teacher provided tellurium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The teacher provided tellurium. \nExplanation: Tellurium is a gray-white solid with a shiny surface, which fits the description of the required substance for the experiment. Therefore, it is likely that the teacher provided tellurium for the experiment. Option A is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the experiment and does not provide any explanation."}}
{"Q": "Their new baby born yesterday. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This new life starts to cry. (B) He is likely to see cottonmouths around.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. This new life starts to cry.\nExplanation: It is common for newborn babies to cry after they are born. This is a natural response to being in a new environment and experiencing the stress of birth. Option B, about seeing cottonmouths, is not related to the birth of a baby and is therefore an unlikely result."}}
{"Q": "Compression sound waves were produced. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom plucked the strings and the friction between the strings and the air produced vibrations. (B) The vocal folds vibrated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Compression sound waves are typically produced by the vibration of vocal folds in the larynx. As air is forced through the vibrating folds, it creates a series of compressions and rarefactions that travel through the air as sound waves. While plucking strings can also produce sound waves, the friction between the strings and the air would not typically result in compression waves."}}
{"Q": "He has been dizzy lately. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Brants had a terrible headache when he was on the field. (B) Jack's hemoglobin levels are low.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Dizziness can be a symptom of anemia, which is often caused by low hemoglobin levels. Option A mentions a headache, which is not necessarily related to dizziness. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jerry was baptized. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The public saw baptism. (B) He was identified by the believers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He was identified by the believers.\nExplanation: Baptism is a symbolic act of publicly declaring one's faith in Jesus Christ. It is a way for believers to identify with Jesus and his death, burial, and resurrection. Therefore, when Jerry was baptized, he was identified by the believers as a fellow believer in Jesus Christ. The public may have seen the baptism, but the primary significance is the identification with the community of believers."}}
{"Q": "Emma, who is a regular coffee drinker, is very hyper these days. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She often deals with their delirium. (B) The doctor diagnosed him as caffeinism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The doctor diagnosed him as caffeinism.\nExplanation: As a regular coffee drinker, Emma may have developed a dependence on caffeine. This can lead to symptoms of caffeinism, such as hyperactivity, anxiety, and insomnia. It is important for her to monitor her caffeine intake and possibly cut back to avoid these symptoms."}}
{"Q": "He defecates on time every day. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom eats some health products containing enzymes every day. (B) My pig took in high fiber feed ingredients.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because high fiber feed ingredients can promote regular bowel movements in animals, including pigs. On the other hand, while health products containing enzymes may have some digestive benefits, they are unlikely to be the sole cause of regular defecation."}}
{"Q": "The angry patient was injected depressants. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He felt angry and scrared. (B) He felt calm and relaxed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He felt calm and relaxed.\nExplanation: Depressants are drugs that slow down the central nervous system, resulting in a feeling of calmness and relaxation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the angry patient would feel calm and relaxed after being injected with depressants."}}
{"Q": "The victims were taken to the police office to identify the crimnimal. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They tried to recall the face of the criminal. (B) They found the body as a female college student.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They tried to recall the face of the criminal.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the victims were taken to the police office to identify the criminal, rather than finding a body of a female college student. The victims would have been asked to recall the face of the criminal in order to help the police with their investigation."}}
{"Q": "She has made a glass of smoothy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice wants to feel the moisture. (B) Lucy has bought a llot of fresh fruit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Lucy has bought a lot of fresh fruit, which prompted her to make a glass of smoothie. Making a smoothie is a common way to use up fresh fruit before it goes bad, and it is a healthy and refreshing drink option. Option A, that Alice wants to feel the moisture, does not provide a clear reason for why she would make a smoothie."}}
{"Q": "He just took the pills. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wants to sleep very much now. (B) He asked the doctor to gave him some depressants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He wants to sleep very much now.\nExplanation: Since the sentence states that he just took the pills, it is more plausible that he would feel drowsy and want to sleep rather than suddenly asking the doctor for more medication. Additionally, the use of the word \"just\" implies that not enough time has passed for him to have a conversation with the doctor and receive more medication."}}
{"Q": "I've been picking fish bones for a long time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My mother stewed a mahimachi for me at noon. (B) The piranha was hungry and found a dead fish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the person picked fish bones because they ate a fish dish, which was stewed by their mother at noon. Piranhas are not commonly found in areas where humans would be picking fish bones, and it is unlikely that a piranha would be hungry and find a dead fish in such a location."}}
{"Q": "They are botanists. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) When scientists took photos today, they found that the protein structure on the surface of rotavirus has changed. (B) They collect specimens everyday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Being botanists, their expertise is in the study of plants. Therefore, it is more plausible that they collect specimens everyday as part of their work rather than having an impact on the protein structure of rotavirus."}}
{"Q": "He caught a bluegill. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John craves for baby bluebirds. (B) The old man wants to catch some sunfish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The old man wants to catch some sunfish.\nExplanation: The mention of catching a bluegill and sunfish are interchangeable terms for the same type of fish. Therefore, it is more plausible that the old man caught a bluegill because he wanted to catch some sunfish, rather than John having a craving for baby bluebirds."}}
{"Q": "This mobile phone is not durable. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The battery often fails to charge. (B) It can be repelled by an inducing corn field.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The battery often fails to charge.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the mobile phone is not durable, which means it is prone to damage or wear and tear. As a result, the battery may fail to charge properly, leading to a shorter battery life and frequent charging issues. Option B, on the other hand, is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the statement."}}
{"Q": "He failed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was finding the fly in his house at night. (B) The patients was in the process of the treatment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The patients was in the process of the treatment.\nExplanation: The cause of the failure is not related to finding a fly in the house at night. Option (B) is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the failure was due to some issue in the treatment process."}}
{"Q": "The baby ground squirrels were hidden by their mom. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were not found by the rattlesnakes. (B) Visitors find it hard to distinguished them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They were not found by the rattlesnakes.\nExplanation: Baby ground squirrels are often preyed upon by rattlesnakes. By hiding them, the mother squirrel is protecting her young from potential danger. Therefore, it is more plausible that the hiding resulted in the babies not being found by the rattlesnakes. Option B is not as likely as visitors are not the main threat to the survival of the baby ground squirrels."}}
{"Q": "He was sentenced to death. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom committed incest and rape. (B) The cerebral cortex of his brain was damaged.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom committed incest and rape.\nExplanation: Committing incest and rape are serious crimes that can result in the death penalty in some countries or states. On the other hand, the damage to the cerebral cortex of the brain is not a crime and would not result in a death sentence. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gongress passed some proposals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The economy has been improved a lot. (B) Small buiness benefited from these proposals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: While it is possible that the proposals passed by Congress could have had a positive impact on the economy as a whole, it is more likely that small businesses specifically would benefit from these proposals. Small businesses often struggle with regulations and taxes, and if Congress passed proposals that eased these burdens, it would make sense that small businesses would see the most direct benefit."}}
{"Q": "Tom's taste buds on his tongue all lost their function. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom couldn't be able to know the taste of whatever he eats. (B) Tom's body began to regulate, reducing the secretion of adrenal hormones.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Taste buds are responsible for detecting different tastes such as sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. If Tom's taste buds lost their function, he wouldn't be able to taste anything he eats, making option A the more plausible answer. The loss of taste buds would not affect the secretion of adrenal hormones, making option B an unlikely outcome."}}
{"Q": "His thyroid can't uptake iodine normally. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He mistook lots of thiocyanate. (B) Tom was advised to take in necessary minerals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He mistook lots of thiocyanate.\nExplanation: Thiocyanate is a chemical that can compete with iodine for uptake by the thyroid gland. If someone consumes too much thiocyanate, it can interfere with the thyroid's ability to take up iodine, leading to a condition called iodine deficiency. This can result in a range of symptoms, including goiter, fatigue, weight gain, and other health problems. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B, advising to take necessary minerals, is not relevant to the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "This creature has no anatomies. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom decided it isn't a colugo. (B) The doctor diagnosed him with mumps.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom decided it isn't a colugo.\nExplanation: If a creature has no anatomies, it means it doesn't have any physical structures or organs. This would make it impossible for the creature to be identified as a colugo or any other known animal. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer as it suggests that Tom had to rule out the possibility of the creature being a colugo due to the lack of anatomies. Option B, on the other hand, is completely unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "He fed meat to the Jackrabbit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The jackrabbit doesn't eat at all. (B) It chewed the food from its ruminant stomach again.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Jackrabbits are not ruminants, so they do not have a four-chambered stomach like cows or sheep. Therefore, they cannot regurgitate and re-chew their food like ruminants do. Feeding meat to a jackrabbit could potentially make it sick or cause digestive issues, but it would not result in the jackrabbit chewing the food from its non-existent ruminant stomach again. Option B is the more plausible answer as it suggests that the jackrabbit ate the meat, but it does not provide any information about the consequences of this action."}}
{"Q": "Tom perfers beers made with bottom Fermenting yeasts. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He ordered lagers in the bar every time. (B) The doctor said he was malnourished.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He ordered lagers in the bar every time.\nExplanation: Beers made with bottom fermenting yeasts are typically lagers, so it is likely that Tom would prefer to order lagers in the bar every time. This preference does not necessarily have any impact on his nutrition or health, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "The species populations in this area changed abnormally over time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Situations of this area got much worse. (B) The process of Succession here was worth exploring.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The process of Succession here was worth exploring.\nExplanation: Abnormal changes in species populations can indicate a disruption in the natural balance of an ecosystem. This disruption could be caused by various factors such as human activities, climate change, or natural disasters. The process of succession refers to the gradual and predictable changes in the composition of species in an ecosystem over time. By exploring the process of succession in this area, scientists can gain insights into the underlying causes of the abnormal changes in species populations and develop strategies to restore the natural balance of the ecosystem. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is too vague and does not provide any specific information about the consequences of the abnormal changes in species populations."}}
{"Q": "Only beryllium has been left. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This flower's carpel was damaged. (B) Tom has put different kinds of materials in the furnace.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Beryllium is a chemical element that is commonly produced through the process of fusion in a furnace. If Tom put different kinds of materials in the furnace, it is possible that the other elements reacted with each other and formed compounds, leaving only beryllium behind. On the other hand, a damaged carpel in a flower would not have any effect on the production of beryllium. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Pictographs were formed step by step. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The ancients recorded by picture writing. (B) His presentation is divided into several modules.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Pictographs were formed step by step because the ancients recorded by picture writing. They used pictures to represent objects, actions, and ideas, and over time, these pictures evolved into more abstract symbols and eventually into a system of writing. This process was gradual and took place over thousands of years, as different cultures developed their own systems of writing based on pictographs."}}
{"Q": "My car is exposed to the acid rain,. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It temperature hasn't been influenced. (B) The paint on my car is clipped.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Acid rain contains harmful chemicals that can damage the paint on a car, causing it to become dull, faded, or even chipped. Therefore, it is more plausible that the paint on the car is clipped rather than the temperature not being influenced."}}
{"Q": "Jane wanted to buy a book full of maps bound together. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She booked a ticket of a museum. (B) She bought some atlases.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Jane wanted a book full of maps bound together, the most plausible answer would be that she bought some atlases. A museum ticket does not relate to her desire for a book of maps, whereas buying atlases would fulfill her need for a collection of maps in book form."}}
{"Q": "Mary put the cake into the refrigeratory. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary complained that the cake became too dry the next day. (B) Mary found the cake was rich in moisture the next day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Mary found the cake was rich in moisture the next day.\nExplanation: Putting the cake into the refrigerator helps to retain moisture and freshness. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mary found the cake to be rich in moisture the next day rather than dry."}}
{"Q": "The doctor treated little Tom's autism with medication. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After three months of treatment, his autism has improved significantly. (B) He had a step-by-step process.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The sentence states that the doctor treated Tom's autism with medication, and the question asks what happened as a result. The only plausible answer based on the information given is that after three months of treatment, his autism has improved significantly. Option B is not supported by the information given in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "There are many trees with different ages. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They have different textures. (B) Scientists have discovered different stages.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Scientists have discovered different stages.\nExplanation: As trees grow, they go through different stages of development. By examining the age of different trees, scientists can identify the different stages of growth and development that the trees have gone through. This can provide valuable information about the history and ecology of a particular area. While trees may have different textures based on their species or environmental conditions, age alone is not a determining factor in texture."}}
{"Q": "Gauss strength diminishes the further the distance from the magnetic field. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wrote in his physics exam that gauss refers to the casual strength of a magnetic field of energy. (B) Surface gauss depends on thickness and size of the magnet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Surface gauss does depend on the thickness and size of the magnet, but the strength of a magnetic field diminishes with distance due to the inverse square law. This means that the strength of the magnetic field decreases as the distance from the source increases, and the rate of decrease is proportional to the square of the distance. This is because the magnetic field lines spread out as they move away from the source, resulting in a weaker field at greater distances."}}
{"Q": "They are large. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This group of Greys have grown up. (B) Coniferous trees are tall.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. This group of Greys have grown up.\nExplanation: The statement \"They are large\" refers to a group of beings, which are likely the Greys mentioned in the previous context. The most plausible explanation for their size is that they have grown up, as opposed to the height of coniferous trees, which is not directly related to the size of the beings."}}
{"Q": "It can hold water up to two liters. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sink has great capacity. (B) Tom is a mathematician.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement is referring to the capacity of something to hold water, which is related to its size or volume. Therefore, option A, which states that the sink has great capacity, is a more plausible answer than option B, which mentions Tom being a mathematician, which is not directly related to the capacity of the sink."}}
{"Q": "Jack looks at the shape of the rotifers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack sees many particles. (B) He saw their bilateral symmetry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Rotifers are known for their bilateral symmetry, meaning they have a left and right side that are mirror images of each other. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack saw their bilateral symmetry rather than just seeing many particles."}}
{"Q": "The doctor's diagnosis confirmed his thought. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom did examinations to see whether he got cancer. (B) Tom had an angiogram at the hospital.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom had an angiogram at the hospital.\nExplanation: The doctor's diagnosis confirmed his thought, which means that Tom had some symptoms or complaints that led the doctor to suspect a certain condition. An angiogram is a medical test that uses X-rays and a special dye to visualize the blood vessels in the heart. It is often used to diagnose heart conditions such as blockages or narrowing of the arteries. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom had an angiogram at the hospital, which led to the doctor's diagnosis. Option A, which suggests that Tom did examinations to see whether he got cancer, is not relevant to the given information and is less likely to be the cause of the doctor's diagnosis."}}
{"Q": "Tom believes that dogs and wolves belong to the same phylum. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is wrong. (B) Tom is right.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tom is right. Dogs and wolves both belong to the phylum Chordata, which includes all animals with a notochord (a flexible rod that provides support) at some point in their development."}}
{"Q": "The light was off at 10 pm. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My pupils became samller suddenly. (B) My pupils became bigger suddenly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. My pupils became bigger suddenly.\nExplanation: When the light is turned off, the environment becomes darker, causing the pupils to dilate or become bigger to allow more light to enter the eye. This is a natural response of the eye to adjust to changes in light levels. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Susan is a midwife. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The goldfish swim away. (B) She was specially trained in childbirth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: She was specially trained in childbirth.\nExplanation: Being a midwife means that Susan has received specialized training in assisting women during childbirth. The fact that she is a midwife implies that she has undergone the necessary education and training to provide care and support to women during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. The goldfish swimming away has no logical connection to Susan being a midwife."}}
{"Q": "He invited his partners to his residence. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They entered his residence. (B) In view of employment, China's economic activities have increased after the Reform and Opening Up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that he invited his partners to his residence, which implies that they entered his residence as a result of the invitation. Option B is not related to the sentence and is irrelevant. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Pecan should be stored in the relatively dry environment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) In the humid environment, pecan is easier to grow mold on it. (B) Pecan like humid environment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Pecan is prone to mold growth in humid environments, which can cause spoilage and affect its quality. Therefore, it is recommended to store pecans in a relatively dry environment to prevent mold growth and maintain their freshness."}}
{"Q": "Another bilogist helps him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The botanist needs natural extraction of Terpenes. (B) This biologist has problems in other scientific fields to solve.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The botanist needs natural extraction of Terpenes, which is a specialized field that requires specific knowledge and skills. It is likely that the biologist who helped him has expertise in this area and was able to provide assistance. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not provide a logical reason for why the biologist would help the botanist with natural extraction of Terpenes."}}
{"Q": "As time goes by, their influence on members grows stronger and stronger. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Leaders of pyramid schemes are extremely good at instilling their own perceptions to members. (B) Leaders of pyramid schemes are extremely good at controlling members.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Leaders of pyramid schemes are often charismatic and persuasive, and they use these qualities to instill their own perceptions and beliefs in their members. They may use tactics such as emotional manipulation, flattery, and promises of wealth and success to keep members loyal and invested in the scheme. Over time, members may become more and more convinced that the scheme is legitimate and that the leaders have their best interests at heart, even in the face of evidence to the contrary. This is why the influence of pyramid scheme leaders tends to grow stronger over time."}}
{"Q": "Tom was looking for Amphibians in winter. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He could only found some sleeping. (B) I took him to the natural habitats of rhinos.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Amphibians are cold-blooded animals and are not active in winter. They usually hibernate or go into a state of torpor to conserve energy. Therefore, it is unlikely that Tom would find active amphibians in winter. The most plausible answer is that he could only find some sleeping amphibians. Option B is not related to the question and does not make sense."}}
{"Q": "The murderer didn't accept himself for a whole life. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He didn't achieve wellness. (B) He experienced suicide.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He didn't achieve wellness.\nExplanation: When someone doesn't accept themselves, it can lead to a lack of self-esteem, self-worth, and self-love. This can result in mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and even addiction. It can also lead to a lack of fulfillment and satisfaction in life, making it difficult to achieve wellness. While suicide is a possibility, it is not the only outcome of not accepting oneself."}}
{"Q": "He eats very little. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My pet tom is in the mating season. (B) My pet tom is in the growing season.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that the pet tom is in the mating season is more likely to cause a decrease in appetite as it is a common behavior in male animals during this time. On the other hand, the growing season does not necessarily affect the pet's appetite."}}
{"Q": "Tom's family go hiking on the plain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They find mangroves. (B) They saw many swamps.", "R": {"text": "Answer: They find mangroves.\nExplanation: The word \"plain\" typically refers to a flat, open area of land, which is not typically associated with swamps. Mangroves, on the other hand, are often found in coastal areas and can grow in flat, open terrain. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's family would come across mangroves while hiking on a plain."}}
{"Q": "This kind of bear grew in the forest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This kind of bear habitates in the forest. (B) It became a female.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. This kind of bear habitates in the forest.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the bear grew in the forest, which implies that it is a species that naturally lives in the forest. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that this kind of bear habitates in the forest. Option B is not a logical consequence of the sentence and is not related to the information given."}}
{"Q": "On the surface of water mains is some solid stuff. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Water with minerals flows in the water mains. (B) Pure water flows in the water mains.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Water with minerals flows in the water mains. The solid stuff on the surface of water mains is likely mineral deposits that have built up over time. Pure water would not leave any solid residue on the surface of the water mains."}}
{"Q": "She had been suffering from diabetes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom neglects personal hygiene. (B) She was particularly fat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She was particularly fat.\nExplanation: Obesity is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Excess body fat can cause insulin resistance, which means the body is unable to use insulin effectively to regulate blood sugar levels. This can lead to high blood sugar levels and eventually diabetes. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) is not relevant to the cause of diabetes."}}
{"Q": "Testicles descend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is in the breeding season. (B) The woman was pregnant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Testicles descend in male animals during the breeding season as a result of hormonal changes that stimulate the descent of the testes into the scrotum. This allows for optimal sperm production and function. Pregnancy in a woman has no effect on the descent of testicles in a male."}}
{"Q": "He opened his mouth. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The anaconda saw his food in the forest. (B) The mayor gathered the people of the whole city in the square.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The mayor gathered the people of the whole city in the square.\nExplanation: The opening of the mouth is not related to the anaconda seeing its food in the forest. However, it is possible that the person opened their mouth in surprise or to speak when the mayor gathered the people of the whole city in the square. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The rope connected to my dog was broken. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Other boys followed to joint it. (B) It ran to other's areas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since the rope connected to the dog was broken, it would have been able to run away from its designated area and potentially into other areas. Option A, where other boys followed to joint it, does not make sense in this context as it is unclear what the boys would be jointing."}}
{"Q": "His legs are entangled in duckweed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was walking in the jungle. (B) Tom was standing in the river and can't move a step.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Tom's legs are entangled in duckweed suggests that he was standing in the river for a period of time, allowing the duckweed to grow around his legs and trap him in place. Walking in the jungle would not likely result in entangled legs, whereas standing in a body of water with vegetation is a more plausible scenario."}}
{"Q": "Tom observed that most of them contain several associated centromeres. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom searched the typical structure of fullerenes. (B) Tom observed the nucleoli of different kinds of chromosomes under the optical microscope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tom observed the nucleoli of different kinds of chromosomes under the optical microscope. The presence of several associated centromeres is a characteristic of certain types of chromosomes, such as metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes. This observation can be made by examining the chromosomes under a microscope, specifically looking at the location of the centromeres. It is not related to the structure of fullerenes, which are a type of carbon molecule."}}
{"Q": "The research set specific aspartate sites. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Caspases cleave target proteins. (B) He found that there were some dinoflagellates.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Caspases cleave target proteins.\nExplanation: Aspartate sites are known to be cleaved by caspases, which are enzymes involved in programmed cell death. Therefore, the research likely found that the specific aspartate sites identified were cleaved by caspases, leading to the cleavage of target proteins. Option B, which mentions dinoflagellates, is not related to the topic of aspartate sites and is therefore an unlikely result of the research."}}
{"Q": "We succeed in the end. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Our fate has been changed. (B) Voldemort became the ultimate villain in the end.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Our fate has been changed.\nExplanation: If we succeed in the end, it means that we have achieved our goal and changed the outcome of the situation. This could refer to any situation, not just the Harry Potter series. Option B is specific to the Harry Potter series and is not a general statement about success."}}
{"Q": "Their cotyledons are destroyed first. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The tardigrades are threatened. (B) Some plants are infected by a rare kind of virus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The tardigrades are threatened.\nExplanation: Tardigrades are known for their ability to survive extreme conditions, including radiation and dehydration. However, when threatened, they may resort to feeding on plant material, including the cotyledons of young plants. Therefore, it is more plausible that the destruction of the cotyledons was caused by the tardigrades being threatened rather than a rare virus infecting some plants."}}
{"Q": "They went to catch eels today. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many were found after seeing a leaking head in crevices. (B) Both of them took Penicillins and recovered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Many were found after seeing a leaking head in crevices.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible as it directly relates to the activity of catching eels. The description of finding eels in crevices is also a common method of catching them. Option B, on the other hand, seems unrelated and unlikely as taking Penicillins is not a typical response to catching eels."}}
{"Q": "The goats died of blood shortage. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The eucalyptus all died from lack of water. (B) Tom's goats were attacked by vampires.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The eucalyptus dying from lack of water would have caused a decrease in the amount of foliage available for the goats to eat, leading to malnutrition and ultimately blood shortage. On the other hand, the idea of Tom's goats being attacked by vampires is not a plausible explanation as vampires are fictional creatures."}}
{"Q": "This user spent over 8 hours a day at this site. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The usage rate of this company's products rose from second to first. (B) This user had a high level of stickiness.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Spending over 8 hours a day on a website indicates a high level of engagement and stickiness. This means that the user is likely to return to the site frequently and spend more time on it, which can lead to increased usage rates and potentially a rise in the company's products. However, it is more plausible that the user's high level of stickiness is the immediate result of spending so much time on the site."}}
{"Q": "Lucy gave me a pen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I added black ink into it. (B) I bought ink for the pen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Lucy gave the pen, it is assumed that the pen did not have ink or had run out of ink. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that the recipient bought ink for the pen."}}
{"Q": "A carpenter will be recruited. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The family cannot afford the tuition for the three children. (B) We need a person skilled in all aspects of construction.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that a carpenter will be recruited because they need a person skilled in all aspects of construction. This implies that the reason for recruiting a carpenter is related to the construction work that needs to be done, rather than financial constraints faced by the family. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is American. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is a homo. (B) Tom was born and brought up in Indinana.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tom was born and brought up in Indiana.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as nationality is typically determined by the country in which a person is born and raised. Being a homo has no correlation with one's nationality."}}
{"Q": "The body decomposes gradually. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Some enzymes are working on the dead body of a bird. (B) The clinical manifestations of wilson disease mainly are dyskinesia such as limb tremor, bradykinesia, gait instability and lmental symptoms such as lethargy, mental behavior changes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The gradual decomposition of a body is caused by the action of enzymes that break down the tissues and organs. These enzymes are produced by bacteria and other microorganisms that colonize the body after death. As the tissues break down, gases are released, causing the body to bloat and eventually collapse. This process can take several weeks or months, depending on the environmental conditions and the presence of scavengers. Choice B is not related to the question and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Many goods have been reduced in price recently. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Deflation makes all kinds of shops miserable. (B) Buys are satisfied with the  trend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Buys are satisfied with the trend.\nExplanation: When goods are reduced in price, it means that consumers can purchase more for less money. This leads to increased satisfaction among buyers as they are able to save money and potentially buy more goods. Deflation may have negative effects on the economy, but in the short term, consumers benefit from lower prices. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Judy suffered from tics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The vet asserted it has panleukopenia. (B) She had involuntary movements in her body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tics are involuntary movements or sounds that a person makes repeatedly. Therefore, it is more plausible that Judy had involuntary movements in her body as a result of her tics, rather than the vet asserting she has panleukopenia, which is a viral disease that affects cats."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to have a bath. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom filled the bath tub with hot water. (B) His owner poured a bowl of water for him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom filled the bath tub with hot water.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom, who is likely a human, would fill a bath tub with hot water to take a bath rather than his owner pouring a bowl of water for him like a pet."}}
{"Q": "This monster was pleased. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This monster killed a boy. (B) This monster saved a boy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This monster saved a boy.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a monster would be pleased after saving someone rather than after killing someone. Saving a life would be a positive action that could bring satisfaction or happiness to the monster, while killing someone would likely bring negative emotions such as guilt or remorse."}}
{"Q": "Hardwoods are deciduous. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They lose their leaves each fall. (B) There is mud to help them grow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Deciduous trees, including hardwoods, lose their leaves each fall as a result of changes in the amount of daylight and temperature. This allows them to conserve energy during the winter months and prepare for new growth in the spring. Mud does not necessarily play a role in the growth of deciduous trees."}}
{"Q": "The scientist finds that aeration also accurs as they grow. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Knowing that live plants will release oxygen as they grow, a scientist makes experiments to find more information about their process of growth. (B) There is a research about the cultivation of bateria.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the scientist found that aeration occurs as plants grow, which suggests that the release of oxygen is a natural part of the growth process. Therefore, option A, which states that the scientist conducted experiments to learn more about the growth process of live plants, is a more plausible answer than option B, which is about bacteria cultivation and not related to the given statement."}}
{"Q": "John only sells amphetamines. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) After that, he became addicted to these drugs. (B) He only looks for people who have failed other weight loss methods.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Selling only amphetamines suggests that John is targeting a specific market, namely those who are looking for weight loss solutions. This implies that he is likely seeking out customers who have tried other methods and failed, rather than becoming addicted to the drugs himself."}}
{"Q": "The reader felt  as though it had human capacities. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The author used Personification to descibe the inanimate object. (B) Some human events were engraved on the people's mind.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The author used Personification to describe the inanimate object.\nExplanation: Personification is a literary device where non-human objects are given human-like qualities. By using this technique, the author can make the reader feel as though the object has human capacities. In this case, the reader felt as though the object had human capacities because the author used personification to describe it."}}
{"Q": "They found there were  a basilar turn with a cystic cavity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They dissected the human ear to see the structure of cochlea. (B) The dentist in need of cavity samples checked many children's teeth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions a basilar turn with a cystic cavity, which is a structure found in the cochlea of the human ear. Therefore, option A, which states that the human ear was dissected to study the cochlear structure, is a more plausible answer. Option B, which talks about a dentist checking children's teeth for cavities, is not related to the structure of the cochlea."}}
{"Q": "His mother carried the decay-causing bacteria and kissed him. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their mouths were dripping with saliva. (B) He was infected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He was infected.\nExplanation: Decay-causing bacteria can lead to dental caries or cavities. If the mother carried the bacteria and kissed her child, the bacteria could have been transferred to the child's mouth, leading to an infection and potentially causing dental problems. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer. Option (A) is not necessarily true as saliva is always present in the mouth and does not necessarily increase due to a bacterial infection."}}
{"Q": "Workers use acrylamide. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The worker is importing a lot chitin. (B) Oil is lost quickly during drilling.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Oil is lost quickly during drilling.\nExplanation: Acrylamide is commonly used in the oil and gas industry as a flocculant to help separate solids from liquids during drilling operations. Therefore, it is more plausible that the worker is using acrylamide due to the nature of their job involving drilling and not because they are importing chitin."}}
{"Q": "The insects decreased swiftly in number. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Several moles were introduced into a piece of farmland where harmful insects thrived. (B) The gardener was asked to kill the insects in the garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Introducing moles into a piece of farmland where harmful insects thrived would lead to a decrease in the number of insects as moles feed on insects. Asking the gardener to kill the insects in the garden may not be as effective in reducing the insect population as it may not address the root cause of the problem."}}
{"Q": "Tom's grandmother is a witch. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many altars have been set up in his courtyard. (B) Her brother sought out a psychoanalyst to treat her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the choices are plausible as they do not directly relate to the fact that Tom's grandmother is a witch. A more plausible answer could be that Tom has grown up with a unique perspective on magic and the supernatural, and may have learned some spells or rituals from his grandmother. Alternatively, he may have faced discrimination or ridicule from others who fear or misunderstand his grandmother's beliefs and practices."}}
{"Q": "Breast tissue is expected to be activated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Prolactin is needed. (B) The sperm can swim freely.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Prolactin is needed.\nExplanation: Breast tissue is activated during pregnancy and lactation, which is stimulated by the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland and is responsible for the development of mammary glands and milk production. Therefore, the activation of breast tissue is directly related to the presence of prolactin. Sperm swimming freely has no direct correlation with breast tissue activation."}}
{"Q": "Tom majored in kinesiology. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jerry is interested in the study on the oldest dogs living. (B) Tom was interested in studying movement.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom was interested in studying movement.\nExplanation: The field of kinesiology is the study of human movement and physical activity. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom chose to major in kinesiology because he was interested in studying movement rather than Jerry's interest in the oldest dogs living."}}
{"Q": "We came to Pygmy land. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They took us in. (B) You can see many birds there.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They took us in.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the Pygmies would take in visitors rather than the presence of birds being the result of arriving in their land. Additionally, the statement \"we came to Pygmy land\" implies that the focus is on the interaction with the people, rather than the wildlife."}}
{"Q": "He went to a volcano and got some accumulations of unconsolidated materials on the flanks. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He put clay and wax in the sun. (B) Tom wanted some lahars.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The accumulation of unconsolidated materials on the flanks of a volcano is most likely due to lahars, which are volcanic mudflows caused by the mixing of water and volcanic ash or other debris. Choice A, putting clay and wax in the sun, has no relevance to the situation described."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said he was suffering from a skin disease. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The thinning of glomerular basement membrane seriously affected his health. (B) Tom sweats a lot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Tom sweats a lot suggests that he may have a skin condition caused by excessive sweating, such as a fungal infection or eczema. Option A is not relevant to skin diseases and refers to a kidney condition."}}
{"Q": "He found ways to prevent oxidation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom doesn't know Berkelium. (B) The seller should avoid nature's way of spoiling things like food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The seller should avoid nature's way of spoiling things like food.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned in the sentence found ways to prevent oxidation, which is a natural process that causes things to spoil or deteriorate. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the seller should avoid nature's way of spoiling things like food. Option A is irrelevant to the sentence and does not provide any explanation for the cause of preventing oxidation."}}
{"Q": "She is very good at communicating with others. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Susan's cell phone is very hot after use. (B) She is the best receptionist in her company.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She is the best receptionist in her company.\nExplanation: The given statement talks about someone's communication skills, which is more likely to be influenced by their job role and experience rather than the temperature of their cell phone. Option (B) provides a more plausible explanation as being a receptionist requires constant communication with clients, colleagues, and superiors, which can help develop strong communication skills."}}
{"Q": "His friend saw the two small front limbs on that photo. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jessy saw a picture of spine. (B) The man took a photo of the bipe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The presence of two small front limbs in a photo suggests that it is not a photo of a bipe, which only has two legs. Option A, which suggests that Jessy saw a picture of a spine, is a more plausible explanation for the presence of small front limbs in the photo."}}
{"Q": "He can't see clearly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There must be something wrong with his nose. (B) There must be something wrong with the nuclei in his brainstem.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There must be something wrong with the nuclei in his brainstem.\nExplanation: If someone can't see clearly, it is likely due to a problem with their eyes or the visual processing centers in their brain. The brainstem contains nuclei that are responsible for controlling eye movements and processing visual information. Therefore, if someone is experiencing vision problems, it is more likely that there is an issue with the nuclei in their brainstem rather than their nose."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a weak photosensitivity. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom only knew three parts of speech. (B) He was allergic to the sunshine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He was allergic to the sunshine.\nExplanation: Photosensitivity is a condition where a person is sensitive to light, which can cause skin rashes, hives, or other allergic reactions. It does not affect a person's knowledge of grammar or language, so option (A) is not a plausible answer. Option (B) is a more likely outcome of photosensitivity, as exposure to sunlight can trigger an allergic reaction in some people."}}
{"Q": "The researcher marked the different allotropes of sulphur. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The researcher found five types of sulphur. (B) Among them the researcher found the toxic oxidants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The question states that the researcher marked the different allotropes of sulphur, which means that they identified and distinguished between the various forms of sulphur. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the researcher found five types of sulphur, as there are indeed five known allotropes of sulphur: rhombic, monoclinic, plastic, amorphous, and cyclo-octasulfur. The question does not provide any information to suggest that the researcher specifically found the toxic oxidants, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The whole kitchen was burnt down more quickly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bill put oil on the firewood. (B) Tom put his porridge into the microwave oven.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Bill put oil on the firewood.\nExplanation: Putting oil on firewood can cause a rapid and uncontrollable fire, leading to the whole kitchen being burnt down quickly. On the other hand, putting porridge in a microwave oven may cause a fire, but it is less likely to burn down the entire kitchen in a short amount of time. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor gave him some medicine containing spectinomycin. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wiped those nourishment on the tissue. (B) Lucy has suffered from the gonococcal infection when she was pregnant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Spectinomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat gonococcal infections, which are caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person in question has contracted a gonococcal infection and is being treated with spectinomycin, rather than wiping nourishment on a tissue. The mention of Lucy's gonococcal infection during pregnancy is likely a distractor and not directly related to the person in question."}}
{"Q": "The doctor used antipyretic to treat her fever. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A woman got infectious in her wound, which led to bacteremia. (B) The doctor traced the sources of this toxin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Antipyretics are used to treat fever, which is often a symptom of an infection. Choice A suggests that the woman had an infection that led to bacteremia, which could cause a fever. Choice B does not provide any information about the cause of the fever, so it is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Jack put amylase into starch. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The breakdown of starch is accelerated. (B) The food in his body digested quickly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The breakdown of starch is accelerated.\nExplanation: Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simpler sugars. Therefore, when Jack put amylase into starch, the enzyme would have catalyzed the breakdown of starch into simpler sugars, accelerating the process of starch digestion. This does not necessarily mean that the food in his body would digest quickly, as there are many other factors that affect the speed of digestion."}}
{"Q": "He often catches walleye. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Peter likes to go fishing by the lake in spring. (B) He lives in the coastal area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Peter likes to go fishing by the lake in spring.\nExplanation: The fact that Peter often catches walleye suggests that he is intentionally fishing for them. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this, as walleye are a common fish found in lakes and are often caught in the spring. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear connection to walleye fishing as walleye are not typically found in coastal areas."}}
{"Q": "He recently was diagnosed with the multiple sclerosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has wristed his hands. (B) Tom suffered from the demyelination many years ago.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, specifically the myelin sheath that covers nerve fibers. Demyelination is the process of damage to the myelin sheath, which can lead to the symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Wristing one's hands would not cause multiple sclerosis, so option A is not a plausible answer. Option B is more likely as it suggests that Tom suffered from demyelination many years ago, which could have led to the development of multiple sclerosis."}}
{"Q": "There are different kinds of weather in different places on the earth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People are praying for more corns this year. (B) It is much colder along fault lines.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement about different kinds of weather in different places on earth suggests that there are variations in temperature and climate. This would not necessarily have an impact on crop yields, as suggested in option A. However, fault lines are areas where tectonic plates meet and can cause earthquakes, which can lead to changes in temperature and weather patterns. Therefore, it is more plausible that weather variations would be related to fault lines rather than crop yields."}}
{"Q": "Luke's backbones received outside pressure. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His rigid bones bent. (B) Luke has the right to hold concils.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His rigid bones bent.\nExplanation: When a backbone receives outside pressure, it is likely to bend or deform. This is because bones are not completely rigid and can be affected by external forces. Therefore, it is more plausible that Luke's backbones would bend rather than him suddenly gaining the right to hold councils."}}
{"Q": "Gems are precious. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Everyone cherishes the gem as the treasure although there are something else in the mineral kingdom. (B) They company with their wives and never leave them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Everyone cherishes the gem as the treasure although there are something else in the mineral kingdom.\nExplanation: Gems are considered precious because of their rarity, beauty, and value. As a result, people tend to cherish them and consider them as treasures. However, there are other minerals in the kingdom that are also valuable, but gems are more highly prized due to their unique characteristics. Therefore, it is more plausible that people would cherish gems rather than suddenly become more devoted to their spouses."}}
{"Q": "Jack is a hairdresser. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His hands were corroded by chemical products. (B) He or she tends to be allergic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack or any hairdresser would develop allergies due to constant exposure to hair products rather than their hands being corroded by chemical products. Allergic reactions are a common occupational hazard for hairdressers and can range from mild skin irritation to severe respiratory problems."}}
{"Q": "Tom submitted my ideas as his own. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He became excited. (B) He was accused of plagarism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He was accused of plagiarism.\nExplanation: If Tom submitted someone else's ideas as his own, it is considered plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would face consequences such as being accused of plagiarism rather than becoming excited."}}
{"Q": "His eyes were lack in light-gathering agents. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His body's resistent to infection was lowered. (B) He should eat more carrots which is rich in carotenoids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The statement suggests that the person's eyes lack the ability to gather light, which could indicate a problem with the retina or other parts of the eye responsible for vision. This would not be related to the consumption of carrots, which are known to contain carotenoids that can improve eye health. However, a lack of light-gathering agents could potentially affect the body's immune system, leading to a lowered resistance to infection."}}
{"Q": "Tom was a homosexual. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He also had basic needs to make love as others. (B) The hospital put him in an isolation ward and sterilized him daily.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He also had basic needs to make love as others.\nExplanation: Being homosexual does not automatically lead to any specific consequence. However, it is important to recognize that individuals who identify as homosexual have the same basic needs and desires as anyone else, including the need for intimacy and love. It is not appropriate or ethical to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation. Option B is not a plausible answer as it suggests a cruel and inhumane treatment that is not acceptable in any circumstance."}}
{"Q": "He produced wonderful literature based on his experience. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Hemingway had a rich life experience. (B) This boy has little life experience.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Hemingway had a rich life experience.\nExplanation: Hemingway was known for his adventurous lifestyle, which included serving in World War I, living in Paris during the 1920s, and going on safaris in Africa. These experiences provided him with a wealth of material to draw from in his writing, allowing him to create vivid and realistic stories that resonated with readers."}}
{"Q": "The patient is plagued by weakness. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The patient suffers from post-polio syndrome. (B) Loggerheads atre abundant in the sea.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The patient suffers from post-polio syndrome.\nExplanation: Post-polio syndrome is a condition that affects individuals who had polio in the past. It is characterized by weakness, fatigue, and muscle pain. Therefore, it is a more plausible answer than loggerheads being abundant in the sea, which is unrelated to the patient's symptoms."}}
{"Q": "Tom is taking a course in cryobiology. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When he does experiments, he needs to freeze the biological specimens in advance for observation. (B) He took use of stoichimetry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Cryobiology is the study of the effects of low temperatures on living organisms. Therefore, it is likely that Tom would need to freeze biological specimens in advance for observation in his experiments. Stoichiometry, on the other hand, is a branch of chemistry that deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions, which may not be directly related to cryobiology."}}
{"Q": "Temperature in this house can be very low in winter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This house has some infiltration problem. (B) These people lives on the torrid zone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the temperature in the house can be very low in winter, which suggests that the house is not properly insulated or has some infiltration problem. Option B, which suggests that the people live in the torrid zone, is not a plausible answer as the torrid zone is characterized by high temperatures and humidity, not low temperatures in winter."}}
{"Q": "Emily has many beautiful dolls. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Each of them has a fashion hairstyle. (B) They are popular.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Emily's dolls are popular because they are beautiful, rather than each of them having a fashion hairstyle. Beauty is a more universal and desirable trait in dolls, while hairstyles can be subjective and may not appeal to everyone. Additionally, having many beautiful dolls would increase the likelihood of them being popular among collectors or children who enjoy playing with dolls."}}
{"Q": "The physics teacher will explain the nature of current in this lesson. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He talked a lot about current loads. (B) It indicates the time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The physics teacher talked a lot about current loads as a result of explaining the nature of current in the lesson. This is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the topic being taught and is a common area of discussion when explaining current. Option B, indicating time, is not relevant to the topic of current and therefore is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He found many trees with good branches. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jason planted pineapples in the direct-sunlight place. (B) Bob wants to study photosynthesis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement about finding many trees with good branches does not mention anything about pineapples or direct sunlight, so option A is not a plausible answer. On the other hand, option B is more plausible as Bob's interest in studying photosynthesis could have led him to plant trees with good branches to observe the process more closely."}}
{"Q": "The customer considered geomancy  very important. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The house selling girl emphasized the high price of the house. (B) The house selling girl emphasized the spiritual ecology of the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since the customer considered geomancy very important, it is more likely that the house selling girl would emphasize the spiritual ecology of the house, which includes factors such as energy flow, feng shui, and other aspects related to geomancy. Emphasizing the high price of the house would not necessarily be relevant to the customer's interest in geomancy."}}
{"Q": "They can live well in winter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They dig to the subsoil. (B) Seals are mammals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Many animals, such as rodents and rabbits, dig burrows in the ground to escape the harsh winter weather. By digging to the subsoil, they can find a more stable temperature and protection from the wind and snow. This allows them to survive and even thrive during the winter months. Seals being mammals is not relevant to their ability to live well in winter."}}
{"Q": "His mother's bone began to lose rapidly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom had an osteoma. (B) His mother has just gone through menopause.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Menopause is a natural process in which a woman's body stops producing estrogen, which can lead to bone loss. This is a common occurrence in women as they age and can result in conditions such as osteoporosis. While osteoma can also affect bone health, it is less likely to be the cause in this scenario as it is a rare benign tumor that usually does not cause significant bone loss."}}
{"Q": "The bulk of the heart's mass was negatively affected. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The heart contracted. (B) This disease caused degenerative changes of the myocardium in Tom's heart.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This disease caused degenerative changes of the myocardium in Tom's heart.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that there was a negative impact on the bulk of the heart's mass, which indicates a structural change in the heart. The term \"degenerative changes\" implies a gradual deterioration of the heart muscle, which is a characteristic of certain heart diseases. On the other hand, the heart contracting is a normal physiological process and would not necessarily cause negative effects on the heart's mass. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My baby was baptized. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Father gave my baby immersion. (B) The whole famly has made a complete plan.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The Father gave my baby immersion.\nExplanation: Baptism is a religious sacrament that involves the immersion or sprinkling of water on a person's head as a symbol of purification and admission into the Christian church. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the baby's baptism was due to the Father giving the baby immersion, rather than the whole family making a complete plan."}}
{"Q": "Tom wandered in the early spring. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom saw penguins. (B) Tom saw snowdrops.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom saw snowdrops.\nExplanation: Since it is mentioned that Tom wandered in the early spring, it is more likely that he would come across the first signs of spring, such as the blooming of snowdrops, rather than seeing penguins which are typically found in colder climates."}}
{"Q": "I am a citizen with all legal rights. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I have enfranchisement regardless of my nationality. (B) They hardened.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I have enfranchisement regardless of my nationality.\nExplanation: Enfranchisement refers to the granting of citizenship and the right to vote. The statement suggests that the person has all legal rights, which would include the right to vote. The phrase \"regardless of my nationality\" further emphasizes that the person's citizenship status is not a barrier to their enfranchisement. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "I lack vitamin C. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My mom buys oranges for me. (B) I have it by drinking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Vitamin C is commonly found in citrus fruits such as oranges. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person's mother would buy oranges for them to increase their vitamin C intake rather than them simply having it by drinking something."}}
{"Q": "Their nomadic lives were broken. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Parakeets were caught by hunters in their natural environment. (B) Budgerigars live on cliffs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the nomadic lives of the birds were disrupted or ended. Option A provides a more plausible reason for this as it states that the birds were caught by hunters, which would have a direct impact on their population and migration patterns. Option B, on the other hand, is not relevant to the sentence and does not provide a clear reason for the birds' disrupted lives."}}
{"Q": "Mary wants to cook in the kitchen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor measures her weight. (B) Mary find the kitchen in a restaurant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Mary finds the kitchen in her own home.\nExplanation: Since the question states that Mary wants to cook in the kitchen, it is more plausible that she would be referring to the kitchen in her own home rather than a restaurant. Therefore, option (B) can be ruled out. Option (A) is also unlikely as there is no clear connection between Mary wanting to cook and a doctor measuring her weight."}}
{"Q": "She can have a rest after the daytime. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy works in a courthouse. (B) Lucy works in a bar.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lucy works in a courthouse.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lucy works in a courthouse as it is a more formal and professional setting where employees are likely to have designated break times. In contrast, working in a bar may involve longer and more irregular hours, making it less likely for Lucy to have a set time for rest during the day."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has reached her sexual maturity. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She had involuntary movements in her body. (B) Her menstruation starts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Her menstruation starts.\nExplanation: Menstruation is a clear sign of sexual maturity in females. It indicates that the reproductive system is functioning properly and the body is capable of bearing children. Involuntary movements in the body are not necessarily a sign of sexual maturity and can have various other causes."}}
{"Q": "He was shocked. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He went to Africa and saw camels. (B) Tom saw a typical virago for the first time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Seeing camels in Africa may be surprising, but it is not likely to cause shock. On the other hand, seeing a typical virago (a domineering, aggressive woman) for the first time could be shocking and unexpected."}}
{"Q": "The percentage of oxygen is low in water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Iguanas have difficulty in breathing. (B) Vehicles of too big sizes cannot enter it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Iguanas have difficulty in breathing.\nExplanation: Oxygen is essential for respiration in most animals, including iguanas. If the percentage of oxygen in water is low, it can lead to a lack of oxygen for aquatic animals, making it difficult for them to breathe. On the other hand, the percentage of oxygen in water does not affect the ability of vehicles to enter it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The vegetation there is exceptionally vigorous. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This place is warm and humid. (B) The rain forest abounds with rain.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The rain forest abounds with rain.\nExplanation: Rain forests are known for their high levels of rainfall, which can exceed 100 inches per year. This abundant rainfall provides the necessary moisture for plants to grow and thrive, leading to exceptionally vigorous vegetation. While warmth and humidity can also contribute to plant growth, the abundance of rain is the more likely cause of the vigorous vegetation in a rain forest."}}
{"Q": "His wound no longer hurts, and he fainted after being excited. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor gave him a dose of medicine. (B) He took opium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the doctor gave him a dose of medicine to relieve his pain, which also caused him to feel drowsy and faint after being excited. Taking opium would not necessarily relieve his pain and could have potentially caused other negative side effects."}}
{"Q": "He found its jaw. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The zebre saw a lion. (B) Tom cut the head of the perch.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tom cut the head of the perch, it is likely that the jaw was left behind as a result. On the other hand, there is no clear connection between a zebra seeing a lion and the discovery of a jaw. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Weightlifters train very hard. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their muscles grow fast. (B) They are constantly learning new skills.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Their muscles grow fast.\nExplanation: Weightlifting is a form of resistance training that involves lifting heavy weights to build muscle strength and size. When weightlifters train hard, their muscles experience micro-tears, which then repair and grow stronger and larger during rest periods. This process is known as muscle hypertrophy and is the reason why weightlifters often have well-developed muscles. Therefore, it is more plausible that weightlifters' muscles grow fast as a result of their hard training rather than constantly learning new skills."}}
{"Q": "He used the picture of its dense pulses to prove his opinion. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He portrayed the tree as if it had human capabilities in his essay. (B) The phonetician said the sound has a high frequency.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of using the picture of dense pulses was the phonetician's statement about the sound having a high frequency. The picture of dense pulses is likely a visual representation of the sound waves with high frequency, which supports the author's opinion. Choice A is not relevant to the given information."}}
{"Q": "The pond is teemed with eggs. . What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack often goes to the pond to watch tadpoles. (B) The frogs have spawned these days.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The frogs have spawned these days.\nExplanation: The word \"teemed\" suggests a large number of eggs, which is a common occurrence during the breeding season of frogs. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the eggs in the pond is due to the frogs spawning rather than Jack's observation of tadpoles."}}
{"Q": "Sally's throat is severely inflamed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sally cannot make any sound. (B) Her sight was harmed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Sally cannot make any sound.\nExplanation: Inflammation of the throat can cause difficulty in speaking or complete loss of voice. It does not affect the sight, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The birds located this zone as habitat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) No part of zones is good for living. (B) This part of zone is comfortable for birds to live.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Birds located this zone as habitat because this part of the zone is comfortable for them to live. If no part of the zone was good for living, the birds would not have chosen this particular area as their habitat. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He found a lot of taurine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John was studying the cellular composition of mammals. (B) My son wanted to learn distribution of plant species.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Taurine is an amino acid that is found in high concentrations in mammalian tissues, particularly in the heart and muscles. Therefore, it is more likely that John was studying the cellular composition of mammals, which would involve analyzing the presence and distribution of taurine in different tissues. On the other hand, studying the distribution of plant species would not typically involve analyzing taurine levels."}}
{"Q": "Kate felt surprised and novel. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mother told Kate how the Osprey carried food. (B) Kate's mother tells Kate fairy tales every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Kate felt surprised and novel because her mother told her how the Osprey carried food. This is a new and interesting piece of information for Kate, which caused her to feel surprised and curious. On the other hand, listening to fairy tales every day may not necessarily make Kate feel surprised and novel as she may have heard them before."}}
{"Q": "The subjects' heart rates varied widely. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor touched the subject's breast. (B) The doctor touched the subject's shoulder.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cause of the subjects' varied heart rates was due to the doctor touching their shoulder, as this area is closer to the heart and can elicit a physiological response. Touching the breast may also cause a physiological response, but it is less likely to be the sole cause of such a wide variation in heart rates."}}
{"Q": "The country lacks carbohydrates. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They are short of the primary source of fuel. (B) Nutritionists suggest balanced food mix.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They are short of the primary source of fuel.\nExplanation: Carbohydrates are the primary source of fuel for the body. If a country lacks carbohydrates, it means that the people in that country are not getting enough energy to sustain their daily activities. This can lead to a variety of health problems, including fatigue, weakness, and malnutrition. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lack of carbohydrates would result in a shortage of the primary source of fuel. While nutritionists may suggest a balanced food mix, this would not necessarily be the immediate result of a carbohydrate shortage."}}
{"Q": "The little pigeons that he nurtures can fly faster. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Harry always uses little pigeons to deliver letters. (B) Harry keeps pairing two flying pigeons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Harry keeps pairing two flying pigeons.\nExplanation: Pairing two flying pigeons can result in offspring with better flying abilities due to genetic traits being passed down from both parents. This is a common practice in pigeon breeding and can lead to faster and stronger pigeons. Therefore, it is more plausible that Harry's little pigeons can fly faster because he keeps pairing two flying pigeons."}}
{"Q": "Scientists arrived in the ice free coastal areas of the Arctic highlands to investigate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists observe the reproduction process of perch. (B) Scientists want to study narwhals in the summer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Scientists wanting to study narwhals in the summer is a more plausible answer as narwhals are known to migrate to the Arctic highlands during the summer months. The ice-free coastal areas provide easier access for scientists to study these animals and their behavior. On the other hand, observing the reproduction process of perch may not necessarily require scientists to go to the Arctic highlands, and there may be other locations where this can be studied."}}
{"Q": "He was diagnosed with a kind of syndrome. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom suffers from hypocalcemia. (B) Tom got infected by something unknown.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom suffers from hypocalcemia.\nExplanation: Hypocalcemia is a medical condition where the level of calcium in the blood is too low. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including muscle cramps, seizures, and abnormal heart rhythms. It is a more plausible answer than option B, which is too vague and lacks any specific information about the cause of the syndrome."}}
{"Q": "Alan coated his skin with beeswax. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was poisoned. (B) He tore off the beeswax and successfully depilated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He tore off the beeswax and successfully depilated.\nExplanation: Beeswax is commonly used in depilatory products to remove hair. By coating his skin with beeswax, Alan was likely attempting to remove unwanted hair from his body. Therefore, it is more plausible that he was able to successfully depilate by tearing off the beeswax, rather than being poisoned by it."}}
{"Q": "Tom's father is a chef. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has a recipe of the dishes that he is good at. (B) Tom wants to show off his cooking skills.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tom's father, being a chef, has a recipe of the dishes that he is good at. This is a common practice among chefs, as they often have signature dishes that they are known for. It is less likely that Tom would want to show off his cooking skills just because his father is a chef, as this would depend on Tom's own interests and abilities."}}
{"Q": "He was surprised at their ways similar to multicellular animals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The experimenter expected the Paramecium has a special way of consuming food. (B) Tom has met two plesiosaurs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the experimenter was surprised at their ways similar to multicellular animals, implying that the experimenter had a preconceived notion that Paramecium had a different way of consuming food. This suggests that option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is irrelevant to the sentence and does not provide a logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "She didn't cared about her latency. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy has taken a vague photo. (B) The kid hoped to stay away from learning.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lucy has taken a vague photo.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that the subject, Lucy, did not care about her latency, which could mean that she was not concerned about the quality of her photo. Therefore, option A, which suggests that Lucy took a vague photo, is a more plausible answer than option B, which is unrelated to the context."}}
{"Q": "The chemist is drawing a tree of the platinum group of metals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He draws ruthenium as one branch of the tree. (B) He draws plastics as one branch of the tree.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The platinum group of metals includes six elements: platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium. Therefore, it is plausible that the chemist would draw ruthenium as one branch of the tree since it is a member of the platinum group. On the other hand, plastics are not related to the platinum group of metals, so it is unlikely that the chemist would draw plastics as one branch of the tree."}}
{"Q": "Several days later, this lake is filled with microbes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A few microbes live in this lake. (B) Tom accidentally threw some waste containing curium into a lake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the lake was already home to a population of microbes that multiplied rapidly under favorable conditions, rather than Tom accidentally contaminating the lake with a radioactive element. Microbes are known to thrive in aquatic environments, and their growth can be influenced by factors such as temperature, nutrient availability, and pH levels. Therefore, it is likely that the sudden increase in microbial population was due to natural causes rather than human intervention."}}
{"Q": "The cattle was poisoned. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Farmers always burn stalks. (B) The cattle accidentally ingested nitrate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The cattle accidentally ingested nitrate.\nExplanation: Nitrate poisoning is a common cause of cattle poisoning. Nitrate is found in fertilizers and can accumulate in plants, especially during drought conditions. When cattle ingest plants with high levels of nitrate, it can lead to nitrate poisoning, which can be fatal. Burning stalks (choice A) is not a common cause of cattle poisoning."}}
{"Q": "He eats some capsaicin and the pain is mitigated. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The wound left during an accident causes great pain for Tom. (B) Jack has been suffering from stomach cramps lately.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The cause of the pain mitigation after eating capsaicin is not given in the question. Therefore, none of the choices provided are plausible answers."}}
{"Q": "The chaps ran into problems. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They managed to slove the problems. (B) The manager solved these problems in time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence only states that the chaps ran into problems, but it does not mention any external help or intervention. Therefore, it is more plausible to assume that they managed to solve the problems on their own."}}
{"Q": "The chemistry teacher used some polymers for experiments. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He changed its ranges many times. (B) The experiment produced a lot of smoke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The given information suggests that the chemistry teacher used polymers for experiments. There is no mention of any changes in ranges, but it is stated that an experiment was conducted. Therefore, option B seems more plausible as it suggests that the experiment produced a lot of smoke, which could be a possible outcome of using polymers in experiments."}}
{"Q": "Tom listened to the advice from his teacher. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He learned about his teacher's experience as well. (B) The teacher told him to open to each moment with calm awareness.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The sentence only states that Tom listened to the advice from his teacher, but it does not provide any information about what the advice was or what happened as a result of following it. Therefore, option A is more plausible as it provides a possible outcome that is not contradicted by the sentence. Option B is not a plausible answer as it introduces new information that is not mentioned in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "His father was getting weak and suffering from lung cancer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike was 30 years old. (B) His father often smokes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His father often smokes.\nExplanation: Lung cancer is strongly associated with smoking. Studies have shown that smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, and it is estimated that 85% of lung cancer cases are caused by smoking. Therefore, it is more plausible that the father's lung cancer was caused by his smoking habit rather than his son's age."}}
{"Q": "His mother cooked some custards and milk for him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John wanted to eat the first discovered variety of macaques. (B) Tom was hungry when he got up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of his mother cooking custards and milk was that Tom was hungry when he got up. This is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the action of cooking food for someone who is hungry. Choice A, about John wanting to eat macaques, is not related to the situation and seems unlikely."}}
{"Q": "Lymphocytes around the patient's buttom got disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The surrounding vessels were influenced. (B) The patient went into convulsions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The surrounding vessels were influenced.\nExplanation: Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that play a key role in the immune system. If lymphocytes in a particular area of the body become diseased, it can lead to inflammation and damage to the surrounding tissues. In this case, it is likely that the lymphocytes around the patient's bottom caused inflammation and damage to the surrounding blood vessels, which could have a range of consequences depending on the severity and location of the damage. Convulsions, on the other hand, are not a likely result of lymphocyte disease in this area of the body."}}
{"Q": "She eats some laxatives and her colon expels shit swiftly from the bowel. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Linda has suffered from constipation for a week. (B) Anna lacks pepper in her intestinal area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The use of laxatives suggests that Linda has been experiencing constipation, which is characterized by difficulty passing stool and infrequent bowel movements. The laxatives would stimulate the muscles in the colon to contract and push out the stool, resulting in swift expulsion. Lack of pepper in the intestinal area is not a known cause of constipation or rapid bowel movements."}}
{"Q": "This peccarie was unharmed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom constantly added some salt into a water tank containing halophiles. (B) A peccarie was attacked by a snake with venom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it has a direct connection to the well-being of the peccarie. Adding salt to a water tank containing halophiles would not have any direct impact on the peccarie's safety. On the other hand, if the peccarie was attacked by a venomous snake, it would have been harmed. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the peccarie being unharmed."}}
{"Q": "My friend found more small bolts for me. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I ran out of ammunition for my crossbow. (B) Smoking will inhale nicotine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the friend found more small bolts for the speaker suggests that they were in need of them for a specific purpose. Option A, which states that the speaker ran out of ammunition for their crossbow, is a more plausible explanation for why they needed the bolts. Option B, which discusses smoking and nicotine inhalation, is unrelated to the situation and does not provide a logical explanation for the friend finding more small bolts."}}
{"Q": "Batteries should not be casually thrown. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom accidentally threw some waste containing curium into a lake. (B) Anything containing caustic mixtures of chemicals should not be casually thrown.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Batteries contain chemicals that can be harmful to the environment if not disposed of properly. Caustic mixtures of chemicals can leak out of the batteries and contaminate soil and water sources. Therefore, batteries should not be casually thrown and require proper disposal methods. Choice (A) is not relevant to the cause of batteries not being casually thrown."}}
{"Q": "Tom felt so nervous in the running competition. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His leg cramps. (B) His natural temperament was affected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's nervousness affected his natural temperament, such as making him more jittery or anxious, rather than causing his leg to cramp. Anxiety and nervousness can have a psychological impact on a person's behavior and emotions."}}
{"Q": "Tom is under the weather. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor prescribed him an emetic. (B) The doctor gave him some medicine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The doctor gave him some medicine.\nExplanation: When someone is \"under the weather,\" it means they are feeling sick or unwell. In this case, it is more plausible that the doctor would prescribe medicine to help alleviate Tom's symptoms rather than an emetic, which is a medication used to induce vomiting and would not be appropriate for most illnesses."}}
{"Q": "It is a freshwater lake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Various species live in this lake. (B) There is no living beings in this lake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Various species live in this lake.\nExplanation: Freshwater lakes are habitats for various species of plants and animals. The availability of freshwater supports the growth of aquatic plants and provides a habitat for fish, amphibians, and other aquatic animals. Therefore, it is more plausible that various species live in this lake rather than there being no living beings in the lake."}}
{"Q": "Tom is doing his experiment with his classmate. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His classmate was eliminated. (B) His classmates were a disservice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer based on the given information. \nExplanation: The question does not provide any information about what happened during the experiment or what the outcome was. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether Tom's classmate was eliminated or if his classmates were a disservice. A more plausible answer would be \"Insufficient information provided to answer the question.\""}}
{"Q": "The doctor check the CT of my brain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found that there were some dinoflagellates. (B) He found Abscesses.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He found Abscesses.\nExplanation: CT scans are often used to detect abnormalities in the brain, such as tumors, bleeding, or infections. Dinoflagellates are a type of marine plankton and would not be found in a brain CT scan. Abscesses, on the other hand, are a common finding in brain CT scans and can be caused by infections or other conditions. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He wants to eat a pie. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hobo was extremely hungry. (B) Tom ate a lot of irritants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The hobo was extremely hungry.\nExplanation: The most plausible cause for someone wanting to eat a pie is hunger. Option A states that the hobo was extremely hungry, which is a logical reason for him wanting to eat a pie. Option B, on the other hand, mentions Tom eating irritants, which is not related to wanting to eat a pie. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Cannibalism developed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was a rumor that those people had been held in confinement. (B) Those people had been held in confinement for four years.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Those people had been held in confinement for four years.\nExplanation: Cannibalism is often a result of extreme circumstances such as famine, war, or being stranded without food. In this case, being held in confinement for four years would have likely led to a lack of food and resources, ultimately resulting in cannibalism as a means of survival. A rumor alone would not be a sufficient cause for cannibalism to develop."}}
{"Q": "The swimmer saw shark fins in this water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He chose to leave here. (B) He chose to stay here.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He chose to leave here.\nExplanation: Seeing shark fins in the water is a clear indication of danger. It is highly unlikely that the swimmer would choose to stay in the water and risk being attacked by the sharks. Therefore, it is more plausible that the swimmer would choose to leave the water and find a safer place to swim."}}
{"Q": "It rained for the first time in spring recently. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The roadside is full of wild flowers. (B) The water in the river has dried up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The roadside is full of wild flowers.\nExplanation: Spring rain is essential for the growth of plants and flowers. The rain provides the necessary moisture for the seeds to germinate and grow. As a result, the roadside is likely to be full of wildflowers after the first rain in spring. On the other hand, if the water in the river had dried up, it would be due to a lack of rain, not because of the recent rain. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "All the animals went to participate in the travel competition. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Almost no aspect of man's everyday life would be affected. (B) Albatross won the championship.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Albatross won the championship.\nExplanation: The question states that all the animals participated in a travel competition, so it is likely that one of them would have won. Option A, stating that almost no aspect of man's everyday life would be affected, is not relevant to the given information and does not answer the question. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack kept a civet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He thought it was too noisy. (B) Jack can beautify his house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He thought it was too noisy.\nExplanation: Civets are known for their loud vocalizations, especially during mating season. It is likely that Jack found the noise level too high and decided to get rid of the civet. Keeping a civet for the purpose of beautifying a house is not a common reason and therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Mary goes to the optometrist to check her eyes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She puts some natural essential oils on her clothes. (B) The optometrist diagnoses Mary's vision problem.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The optometrist diagnoses Mary's vision problem.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary's visit to the optometrist would result in a diagnosis of her vision problem rather than her putting natural essential oils on her clothes, which is unrelated to the purpose of her visit."}}
{"Q": "Jack wanted to know why there were different rates of reaction. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Finally he found out by looking at books that enantiomers can exhibit diffrent chemical properties. (B) He decided to study rheology first.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it directly addresses the question of why there are different rates of reaction. It explains that enantiomers, which are molecules that are mirror images of each other, can exhibit different chemical properties, which can affect the rate of reaction. This is a valid explanation as the stereochemistry of a molecule can greatly influence its reactivity. Option B, on the other hand, suggests studying rheology, which is the study of the flow of matter, and does not directly address the question of why there are different rates of reaction."}}
{"Q": "His partners were inspired by him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike was interested in data security. (B) He was of great passion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that Mike had a quality that motivated his partners. Being of great passion is a more plausible reason for inspiring others than simply being interested in data security. Passion is contagious and can inspire others to work harder and achieve more."}}
{"Q": "He keeps many gnus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He travels with them together for food. (B) The gnus have eaten up the grass on his lawn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Keeping many gnus would likely result in them eating up the grass on his lawn, as gnus are known to be herbivores and require a lot of vegetation to sustain themselves. Traveling with them for food is less likely as it would require a lot of effort and resources to constantly move the gnus to new grazing areas."}}
{"Q": "Some patients worry about recurrences after their recovery. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The virus inside the nerve cell can be reactivated. (B) The chairman passed away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The virus inside the nerve cell can be reactivated.\nExplanation: After recovery from a viral infection, the virus may remain dormant inside the nerve cells. In some cases, the virus can be reactivated, leading to a recurrence of symptoms. This is a common concern for patients with viral infections such as herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus. However, it is important to note that not all viral infections can cause recurrences."}}
{"Q": "Tom's heart beat so slowly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor insert a pacemaker for him. (B) The doctor told him shortly after that he had a heart attack.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The doctor insert a pacemaker for him.\nExplanation: A slow heart rate, also known as bradycardia, can be a sign of a problem with the heart's electrical system. In some cases, a pacemaker may be necessary to regulate the heart rate and prevent complications such as fainting or heart failure. A heart attack, on the other hand, is caused by a blockage in the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients, and is not directly related to a slow heart rate. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The country regained the sovereignty. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It is already five-moths old. (B) The country would not be controlled by others any more in a violent way.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Regaining sovereignty means that the country is no longer under the control of another country or external force. This implies that the country can now make its own decisions and govern itself without interference from outside forces. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer as it accurately describes the result of regaining sovereignty. Option A is irrelevant and does not provide any meaningful explanation."}}
{"Q": "H was attached to the former by a covalent bond. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The electronegative atom meet the hydrogen H. (B) This atom had reduction and the other had reduction.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share electrons. In this case, the electronegative atom (which has a higher affinity for electrons) met the hydrogen atom (which has only one electron in its outer shell) and shared its electron with the hydrogen atom, forming a covalent bond. This is a more plausible explanation than option B, which mentions reduction, a process that involves the gain of electrons, not sharing them."}}
{"Q": "Tom had an epileptic seizure on the street. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's brain was stimulated a lot. (B) Lucy has waited for Tom for a long time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. This can be triggered by various factors such as stress, lack of sleep, or in some cases, a specific stimulus that overstimulates the brain. Therefore, choice A is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Tom's brain was stimulated a lot, leading to the seizure. Choice B, on the other hand, is not related to the physiological cause of epileptic seizures."}}
{"Q": "He got Tom's fortune for the next week. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A man who knows pyromancy looks at the burning fire. (B) It takes Tom a year to understand the operation mode of the company.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's fortune was obtained due to his understanding of the operation mode of the company, which took him a year to comprehend, rather than a man who knows pyromancy looking at a burning fire. The latter option seems unlikely and unrelated to Tom's fortune."}}
{"Q": "Pregnant woman Alice decides to take more folic acid. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She often eats hazelnuts among nuts. (B) This kept her from gaining weight easily.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She often eats hazelnuts among nuts.\nExplanation: Folic acid is important for the development of the neural tube in a developing fetus. Eating foods high in folic acid, such as nuts, leafy greens, and fortified cereals, can help ensure that a pregnant woman is getting enough of this important nutrient. Hazelnuts are a good source of folic acid, so it is plausible that Alice would choose to eat them more often in order to increase her intake of this nutrient. Option B is less likely, as taking more folic acid would not necessarily prevent weight gain."}}
{"Q": "This kind of young animal grow rapidly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This kind of young animal is likely to be healthy. (B) This kind of young animal is likely to suffer from  scurvy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Rapid growth in young animals is usually a sign of good health and proper nutrition. Scurvy, on the other hand, is a condition caused by a lack of vitamin C and is not related to growth rate. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mother asks Tom to play the violin in front of relatives. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is very good at piano, accordion and violin. (B) Tom plucks the strings all the time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom plucks the strings all the time.\nExplanation: The question states that Tom's mother asked him to play the violin in front of relatives, but it does not mention anything about his proficiency in playing the instrument. Option (A) is irrelevant to the question and does not provide a logical answer. Option (B) is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Tom may not be very skilled at playing the violin and resorts to plucking the strings instead of playing it properly."}}
{"Q": "They eat anything like plants. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are common aquatic plants in South America. (B) Algas became their food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Algas became their food.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the subject in question eats anything like plants, which implies that they are herbivores. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would start feeding on algae, which are aquatic plants, rather than becoming common aquatic plants themselves (option A)."}}
{"Q": "Tom had glibenclamide after drinking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has anemia. (B) Tom wanted to throw up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom wanted to throw up.\nExplanation: Glibenclamide is a medication used to treat diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels. It is not recommended to consume alcohol while taking glibenclamide as it can cause nausea, vomiting, and other adverse effects. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom wanted to throw up after taking glibenclamide and drinking alcohol. Anemia is not a known side effect of glibenclamide."}}
{"Q": "Atmosphere of the two regions are totally different. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His thyroid function was promoted for more intake of iodine. (B) The surfaces of rocky bodies in the two regions are different.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement about the atmosphere suggests that the two regions have different levels of iodine, which can affect thyroid function. Therefore, it is more plausible that the difference in atmosphere led to a promotion of the protagonist's thyroid function for more intake of iodine. The statement about the surfaces of rocky bodies is not directly related to the atmosphere and is therefore less likely to be the result of the difference in atmosphere."}}
{"Q": "The journalist covered it immediately. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The two women had harsh agruments. (B) This disaster became a hot topic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The word \"immediately\" suggests that the journalist acted quickly, indicating that the cause was significant and newsworthy. Option B, which states that the disaster became a hot topic, is more plausible than option A, which only mentions harsh arguments between two women."}}
{"Q": "This kind of wall attracts many wall makers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists have bred a new type of crop with grapes and resistant species. (B) Fiberglass insulation keeps you warm and reduces noise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The statement mentions a \"wall\" and \"wall makers,\" which suggests that the topic is related to construction or building. Choice A, about breeding a new type of crop, is not relevant to this topic. Choice B, about fiberglass insulation, is a common material used in walls for its insulation and noise-reducing properties. Therefore, it is more plausible that the wall makers are attracted to this type of wall due to its use of fiberglass insulation."}}
{"Q": "Tom has put a bottle of water in the refrigerator. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The water in it remained cool. (B) He got a bottle of ice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The water in it remained cool.\nExplanation: When a bottle of water is put in the refrigerator, the temperature of the water decreases, but it does not freeze completely. Therefore, the water in the bottle would remain cool, but it would not turn into ice. Option A is a more plausible answer as it is based on the scientific principle of refrigeration."}}
{"Q": "The doctor advised him to eat more fiber food. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a phenomenon of liver and bile recycling in his body. (B) He is thirsty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The doctor advised him to eat more fiber food because there is a phenomenon of liver and bile recycling in his body. Fiber helps to bind with bile and remove it from the body, preventing it from being reabsorbed by the liver and recycled. This can help to lower cholesterol levels and improve overall digestive health. Thirst is not related to the need for more fiber in the diet."}}
{"Q": "They collected its feathers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They got a meadowlark. (B) A python found its prey from a distance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They got a meadowlark.\nExplanation: It is common for people to collect feathers from birds, especially if they are interested in bird watching or studying their anatomy. The mention of a specific bird, the meadowlark, suggests that the feathers were collected intentionally rather than as a result of a predator's attack. On the other hand, option B is less likely as pythons are not commonly found in areas where meadowlarks live, and it is unlikely that a python would be able to find its prey from a distance and collect its feathers."}}
{"Q": "Tench are common food for them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A group of  men went to a restaurant for dinner. (B) Families living throughout temperate Eurasia like eating freshwater fish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tench are a freshwater fish commonly found in temperate Eurasia. It is likely that families living in this region have developed a taste for this type of fish and have incorporated it into their diets. The option of a group of men going to a restaurant for dinner is not a plausible explanation for the common consumption of tench."}}
{"Q": "The milk goes bad. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cells of milk have some changes. (B) Mike forgot to add rennet to the milk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Milk can spoil due to bacterial growth, which is caused by the lack of pasteurization or refrigeration. However, in this scenario, the most plausible cause is that rennet was not added to the milk. Rennet is an enzyme that is added to milk to coagulate it and turn it into cheese. Without rennet, the milk will not turn into cheese and will eventually spoil."}}
{"Q": "She wants to be like birds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jane doesn't want to gain any weight. (B) Alice wants to make a toy pony by hand.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jane doesn't want to gain any weight.\nExplanation: The desire to be like birds, which are known for their lightness and ability to fly, suggests a desire to be weightless or to avoid gaining weight. Option B, which mentions making a toy pony, is unrelated to the desire to be like birds."}}
{"Q": "It has the function of Glycolysis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments. (B) This enzyme facilitated the breakdown of glucose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This enzyme facilitated the breakdown of glucose.\nExplanation: Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP and NADH in the process. This process is facilitated by the enzyme called hexokinase, which catalyzes the first step of glycolysis by converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the function of glycolysis. Option (A) is not related to the function of glycolysis and is therefore an incorrect answer."}}
{"Q": "The tips of the chromosome shortens each time the cell divides. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The telomeres shorten as the cell divides. (B) The number of mastodons is becoming less and less.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The telomeres shorten as the cell divides.\nExplanation: Telomeres are the protective caps at the end of chromosomes that prevent them from deteriorating or fusing with other chromosomes. Each time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten, eventually leading to cell death or senescence. This is a natural process that occurs in most cells, except for some stem cells and cancer cells that can maintain their telomeres and continue to divide indefinitely. The shortening of telomeres is associated with aging and age-related diseases."}}
{"Q": "Tom put a magnet in pins while he was cleaning the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Almost all the pins bounced off. (B) Almost all the pins are held together by magnets.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Almost all the pins are held together by magnets.\nExplanation: When a magnet is placed near metal objects such as pins, the magnetic force can attract the metal objects towards the magnet. Therefore, it is more plausible that the pins would be held together by the magnet rather than bouncing off."}}
{"Q": "Tom has studied about polypeptides. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has a clear understanding of this problem. (B) He has separated many amino acids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Studying about polypeptides would give Tom a better understanding of the structure and function of these molecules, but it would not necessarily result in him separating amino acids. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The minister appointed a representative for him to attend the meeting. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He turned to the assistants for explaination. (B) The representatives must be careful with his words since he should be responsible to his minister.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Since the minister appointed a representative to attend the meeting on his behalf, it is expected that the representative should be careful with his words and actions as he is representing the minister and should be responsible for his actions. Option A is not a plausible answer as there is no indication that the minister needed an explanation from his assistants."}}
{"Q": "The doctor told him not to worry. There was basically no pathological change. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has met an archaeopteryx on his way home. (B) Einstein's father was detected with retinoblastoma.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of Tom's situation is not given in the question, but option B provides a more plausible answer as it mentions a medical condition (retinoblastoma) that could be related to the doctor's diagnosis of no pathological change. Option A, on the other hand, is unrelated to the medical situation and seems like a random and unlikely event."}}
{"Q": "Tom looked at how does leadership get the achievement of results. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At last he learned it was through people. (B) At last he learned it was through money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. At last he learned it was through people.\nExplanation: Leadership is about inspiring and motivating people to work towards a common goal. While money can be a motivator, it is not the only factor that drives people to achieve results. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom learned that leadership is ultimately about working with and through people to achieve success."}}
{"Q": "Tom has eaten a lot of grapefruit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom likes eating bananas. (B) His high blood pressure was cured without the help of drugs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Grapefruit is known to have a positive effect on blood pressure and can help lower it. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's high blood pressure was cured without the help of drugs as a result of eating a lot of grapefruit. The fact that Tom likes eating bananas is not necessarily related to his consumption of grapefruit."}}
{"Q": "The load divided by its drainage area is large. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This river is of high field. (B) The flood overwhelmed many dikes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: A river with a high field means that it has a large amount of water flowing through it, which would result in a larger load (the amount of sediment and debris carried by the river). Therefore, the load divided by its drainage area would be large. Option B, which suggests that the flood overwhelmed many dikes, may contribute to the increase in load, but it is not the primary cause of the large load."}}
{"Q": "She became a background singer in the chorus. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy was always crying. (B) Mary was a singer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Mary was a singer and likely helped or encouraged the person to become a background singer in the chorus. Option A, that Lucy was always crying, does not seem to have any logical connection to becoming a background singer."}}
{"Q": "Whiskers are closely connected to the nervous system. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They are sensitive. (B) The clerk refused him on the grounds that he didn't have prescription from a psychiatrist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They are sensitive.\nExplanation: Whiskers are connected to a large number of nerve endings, making them highly sensitive to touch and vibrations. This allows animals to navigate their environment and detect prey or predators."}}
{"Q": "The phenomenon of accretion happened. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists study the effect of induction on plant variation. (B) Tom rubbed two small pills together into one big pill.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Accretion refers to the process of gradual growth or increase in size by the accumulation of matter. Rubbing two small pills together into one big pill is a plausible explanation for accretion, as it involves the accumulation of matter to form a larger object. On the other hand, studying the effect of induction on plant variation is not related to the phenomenon of accretion."}}
{"Q": "Tom's heart is beating abnormally. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor insert a pacemaker for him. (B) The doctor measured his electrocardiogram.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The doctor measured his electrocardiogram.\nExplanation: When someone's heart is beating abnormally, the first step a doctor would take is to measure their electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine the cause of the abnormality. This test records the electrical activity of the heart and can help diagnose conditions such as arrhythmia or heart attack. Inserting a pacemaker is a possible treatment option, but it would not be the immediate response without first determining the cause of the abnormal heartbeat."}}
{"Q": "Jane exposed her clothes to the sun. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The colour has faded. (B) The clothes are wet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The colour has faded.\nExplanation: When clothes are exposed to the sun for a prolonged period, the UV rays can cause the colour to fade. This is a common occurrence, especially with brightly coloured or dark clothing items. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jane's clothes would experience fading rather than becoming wet from sun exposure."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have discovered a polymer of sugar. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists say it is oligosaccharide. (B) Scientists say it is glycogen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Scientists say it is glycogen.\nExplanation: Glycogen is a polymer of glucose, which is a type of sugar. It is commonly found in animals and serves as a form of energy storage. Oligosaccharides are also polymers of sugar, but they are typically smaller and have different functions in the body. Therefore, it is more plausible that the newly discovered polymer of sugar is glycogen rather than an oligosaccharide."}}
{"Q": "They found many food. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The beagles were hungry. (B) Humankind gathered food on trees and on ground at first.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The beagles were hungry.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the subject of the sentence, which is the beagles. It is logical to assume that the beagles found many food because they were hungry and actively searching for it. Option B, on the other hand, is not relevant to the sentence and does not provide a clear explanation for why the beagles found many food."}}
{"Q": "He had securities representing ownership shares of his company. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob is the manager of the company. (B) The hard-working staff got stocks of his company.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the hard-working staff got stocks of his company as a form of ownership and incentive for their work. It is unlikely that Bob being the manager of the company would automatically result in him having securities representing ownership shares."}}
{"Q": "At night they set up tents to sleep. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Audrey and her friends take part in group trips. (B) The patients felt that their disease could not be cured.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"they\" setting up tents to sleep, which implies a group of people. Option A states that Audrey and her friends take part in group trips, which is a plausible reason for setting up tents to sleep. Option B, on the other hand, talks about patients feeling that their disease cannot be cured, which is not related to the sentence and seems like an unlikely reason for setting up tents to sleep. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Everyone can be susceptible to other people or things. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The virus spreads widely. (B) Every human is a life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Every human is a life.\nExplanation: As human beings, we are all vulnerable to various external factors such as diseases, accidents, and emotional influences. This is because we are living organisms with complex biological and psychological systems that can be affected by a multitude of factors. Therefore, it is more plausible to say that our susceptibility to other people or things is due to our inherent nature as living beings rather than a specific virus spreading widely."}}
{"Q": "Usually girls showed better attitude than boys in learning English. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Those girl got higher ability in using English. (B) He noticed the shoots it produced one day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Those girls got higher ability in using English.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that girls showed better attitude in learning English, which implies that they were more motivated and engaged in the learning process. This could lead to better retention and application of the language, resulting in higher ability in using English. On the other hand, the second choice is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for the statement."}}
{"Q": "Radishes are planted near cole crops. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many flea beetles have been attracted. (B) They can accumulated on one side.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Many flea beetles have been attracted.\nExplanation: Radishes are known to repel certain pests, including flea beetles, which are a common pest of cole crops such as cabbage and broccoli. By planting radishes near cole crops, the radishes can attract the flea beetles away from the cole crops, reducing the damage they cause. Therefore, it is more plausible that many flea beetles have been attracted to the radishes rather than them accumulating on one side."}}
{"Q": "He was a monotheist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many altars have been set up in his courtyard. (B) He believes in only one god.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If someone is a monotheist, it means they believe in only one god. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer. Option A does not make sense in this context as setting up many altars would be contradictory to being a monotheist."}}
{"Q": "He cannot inhale air normally. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This patient has difficulty in breathing. (B) Lungs problems affected his respiratory system.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the patient is having difficulty inhaling air normally, which indicates a problem with the respiratory system. Option B states that lung problems affected his respiratory system, which is a more plausible answer than option A. Lung problems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pneumonia can cause difficulty in breathing and affect the normal inhalation of air."}}
{"Q": "He suffered from the smallpox. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was in the hospital. (B) There was a virus spreading in the air of Tom's class.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There was a virus spreading in the air of Tom's class.\nExplanation: Smallpox is a highly contagious viral disease that spreads through respiratory droplets. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom contracted the disease from being exposed to the virus in the air of his class rather than being in the hospital."}}
{"Q": "Jessy was thinking whether to go for a trip. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She gave up in case of drastic lotteries. (B) She gave up in case of drastic consequences.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She gave up in case of drastic consequences.\nExplanation: The word \"drastic\" implies that there could be negative outcomes or risks associated with going on the trip. Therefore, it is more likely that Jessy decided not to go due to the potential consequences rather than the possibility of winning or losing a lottery."}}
{"Q": "The doctor showed him samples of his Neuroendocrine cells of endodermal derivation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor looked at the gap synapse between the patient's neurons. (B) The patient didn't believe he got Carcinoids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The patient's disbelief in having Carcinoids may have prompted the doctor to show him samples of his Neuroendocrine cells of endodermal derivation to provide evidence and convince him of his diagnosis. Option A is not related to the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "They subdivide a whole year. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mating season finally ends. (B) There are four seasons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There are four seasons.\nExplanation: The subdivision of a whole year into four seasons is a common practice in many cultures and is based on the astronomical phenomenon of the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the sun. This division helps people to track the changes in weather, temperature, and daylight hours throughout the year. The mating season of animals may vary depending on the species and location, but it is not a significant factor in the subdivision of a year into seasons. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He brought a lawsuit against the company. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His business followed the failure. (B) Jack and his boss had a resignation problem.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"He brought a lawsuit against the company,\" but it does not mention anything about Jack and his boss having a resignation problem. However, it does mention that \"his business followed the failure,\" which suggests that the cause of the lawsuit may have been related to the failure of his business. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The policeman didn't catch him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The stowaway was arrested. (B) The stowaway escaped by the boat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the stowaway escaped by the boat, as it suggests that the stowaway was able to evade the policeman and flee the scene. Option A, that the stowaway was arrested, contradicts the statement that the policeman didn't catch him."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a fever. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are TIPs. (B) Doctors think Tom's fever is caused by infection.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Doctors think Tom's fever is caused by infection.\nExplanation: The given information states that Tom has a fever, but it does not provide any context or explanation for why this is significant or what happened as a result. However, option B provides a plausible explanation for the situation by suggesting that Tom's fever may be caused by an infection, which would require medical attention and treatment. Option A, on the other hand, is completely unrelated and does not provide any explanation or context for Tom's fever. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Scientists observe the difference between haploid and diploid cells. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They call this property covalence. (B) Scientists have discovered the process of mitosis in both.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Scientists have discovered the process of mitosis in both haploid and diploid cells. The observation of the differences between haploid and diploid cells led to further research and understanding of cell division, which ultimately led to the discovery of mitosis in both types of cells. Covalence is a property related to chemical bonding and is not relevant to the observation of haploid and diploid cells."}}
{"Q": "They bought a chiller in a joint venture. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They did an experiment about aeration. (B) Students want to cool the hot water in a rapid way.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the students wanted to cool the hot water in a rapid way, hence the need for a chiller. An experiment about aeration does not necessarily require a chiller, and it is not clear how aeration would be related to the need for cooling hot water."}}
{"Q": "We don't know what oxalate is. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We ask institutes for help. (B) Our teacher tells us it is a by-product of digestion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Our teacher telling us that oxalate is a by-product of digestion is a more plausible answer because it is a common knowledge in biology and nutrition. Asking institutes for help may also be a valid option, but it may take longer to get a response and may not be necessary for a basic understanding of oxalate."}}
{"Q": "I took my pet to see a vet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor was unmoved. (B) He diagnoised my pet with fever.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He diagnosed my pet with fever.\nExplanation: Since the reason for taking the pet to the vet is not mentioned, it is difficult to determine the exact diagnosis. However, it is more plausible that the vet would diagnose the pet with a medical condition rather than being unmoved by the visit. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "Sam only keeps hens. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam's hens can lay eggs. (B) Sam's hens cannot lay eggs without roosters.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sam's hens cannot lay eggs without roosters.\nExplanation: Hens require roosters to fertilize their eggs in order to lay fertile eggs that can hatch into chicks. Without roosters, the eggs laid by Sam's hens would be infertile and therefore unable to hatch. However, the hens can still lay eggs, but they will not be able to hatch into chicks."}}
{"Q": "Weevils were born. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is not too hot but a little wet at this time in summer. (B) A flu attacked this town.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It is not too hot but a little wet at this time in summer.\nExplanation: Weevils thrive in warm and humid conditions, and a little bit of moisture can be enough for their eggs to hatch. Therefore, the wet conditions in summer could have provided the ideal environment for weevils to be born. A flu attacking the town would not have any direct correlation with the birth of weevils."}}
{"Q": "Tom always touches his eyes with his dirty hands. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got eye irritation. (B) He has suffered the trachoma.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Touching the eyes with dirty hands can lead to eye irritation and potentially cause infections. Trachoma is a bacterial infection that is spread through contact with infected eye or nose secretions, and is typically found in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices. While it is possible for Tom to contract trachoma from touching his eyes with dirty hands, it is more likely that he would experience eye irritation as a result of the dirt and bacteria on his hands."}}
{"Q": "He gets some concentrated phytoestrogens. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He processes flaxseeds. (B) He picks cucumbers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He processes flaxseeds.\nExplanation: Flaxseeds are known to be a rich source of phytoestrogens, which are plant compounds that mimic the effects of estrogen in the body. Processing flaxseeds, such as grinding them into a powder or making them into an oil, can concentrate the phytoestrogens even further. On the other hand, cucumbers are not known to contain significant amounts of phytoestrogens, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Tom is an ecologist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has been the best student in the class with the highest skill level. (B) He acknowledges linear approaches.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Being an ecologist does not necessarily mean that Tom has been the best student in the class with the highest skill level. However, it is plausible that as an ecologist, Tom acknowledges linear approaches and understands the importance of considering more complex and holistic approaches in his work."}}
{"Q": "We can see the green concrete paving of this rail. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Urban Construction Bureau has added a new railway here. (B) This streetcar girder rail is dyed green.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This streetcar girder rail is dyed green.\nExplanation: It is common for streetcar or light rail systems to use colored concrete or coatings on their rails to make them more visible to pedestrians and drivers. The green color of the concrete paving on this rail suggests that it has been intentionally dyed for this purpose. Choice (A) is unlikely as it suggests a new railway has been added, which would require significant construction and would not explain the green color of the rail."}}
{"Q": "The conifers survived the winter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Coniferous trees have needles in winter. (B) The harsh winter finally ends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Coniferous trees have needles instead of leaves, which helps them conserve water and survive in cold and dry conditions. The needles also have a waxy coating that helps prevent water loss and protects them from freezing temperatures. Therefore, the fact that the conifers survived the winter can be attributed to their adaptation of having needles."}}
{"Q": "Hydration comes from pure, clean water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The sewage is carried away efficiently. (B) We need to drink water to maintain proper hydration.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: The statement implies that pure, clean water is necessary for hydration, which means that we need to drink water to maintain proper hydration. It does not mention anything about sewage or its efficiency. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The new waiter knew how to communicate with the guests. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The superior leader is responsible for teaching skills. (B) Different customers have different needs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that the new waiter had good communication skills, which suggests that he was trained well. The most plausible answer is that the superior leader or manager is responsible for teaching skills to the new waiter."}}
{"Q": "Lisa had scorpionfish for lunch. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She got stuck in her throat by the bones of the scorpionfish. (B) Lisa eats the parfait in the refrigerator.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She got stuck in her throat by the bones of the scorpionfish.\nExplanation: Scorpionfish are known for having many small, sharp bones that can be difficult to remove. If Lisa didn't properly remove the bones before eating, it's possible that one could have gotten stuck in her throat, causing discomfort or even choking. Eating parfait as a result doesn't make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The teacher asked the students to choose a mammal with the same body heat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They studied the bodies of cockroaches. (B) One student chose lemmings.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) One student chose lemmings. \nExplanation: Since the teacher asked for a mammal with the same body heat, it is unlikely that the students would study the bodies of cockroaches, which are insects and have a different body temperature regulation system. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that one student chose a mammal, in this case, lemmings, that has a similar body heat to the mammal being studied."}}
{"Q": "He wants a feeding service. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He turned to his father. (B) He saved money at his best and bought it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He turned to his father.\nExplanation: Since the sentence does not provide any information about the person's financial situation or ability to save money, it is more plausible that he turned to his father for help with the feeding service. This suggests that the person may not have been able to afford the service on their own and needed assistance from a family member."}}
{"Q": "My mom tells me it is stigma. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I want to know the name of female reproductive structures in flowers. (B) I don't know what CM refers to.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The question mentions \"stigma,\" which is a part of the female reproductive structure in flowers. Therefore, it is more likely that the question is related to the name of female reproductive structures in flowers rather than CM, which could refer to many different things and does not have an obvious connection to stigma."}}
{"Q": "I should concentrate on the writing of a time a place an era. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Product with good quality will sale well. (B) My research interest is about Literature.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of concentrating on the writing of a time, a place, or an era is likely due to the researcher's interest in literature. When studying literature, it is important to understand the historical and cultural context in which it was written in order to fully appreciate and analyze the work. Focusing on a specific time, place, or era can provide valuable insights into the themes, motifs, and literary techniques used by authors during that period. Therefore, it is more plausible that the reason for this concentration is related to the researcher's interest in literature rather than the potential sales of a product."}}
{"Q": "John wants to have a scientific study of the complex water systems of the Earth and help solve water problems. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided to major in malacology. (B) He chooses hydrology as his major.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Hydrology is the study of water in the Earth's system, including its distribution, movement, and quality. It is a more relevant and appropriate major for someone interested in studying complex water systems and solving water problems than malacology, which is the study of mollusks."}}
{"Q": "He was considered as one of the greatest hero in the history. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The killer gave John too much laxative. (B) Yuan Longping has made a great contribution to solving the problem of people's starving.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Yuan Longping is known as the \"Father of Hybrid Rice\" and has made significant contributions to solving the problem of people's starving by developing high-yield hybrid rice varieties. This has helped to increase food production and alleviate hunger in many parts of the world. Therefore, it is more plausible that his contributions to agriculture and food security have earned him the title of one of the greatest heroes in history. Option A is irrelevant and does not provide any explanation for why someone would be considered a great hero."}}
{"Q": "He is able to control the riding rhythm well in horseback riding competitions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is a jockey who is controlling his weight recently. (B) He has good endurance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He has good endurance.\nExplanation: Good endurance is a key factor in controlling the riding rhythm in horseback riding competitions. It allows the rider to maintain a consistent pace and make adjustments as needed throughout the competition. While being a jockey and controlling weight may also be important factors in horseback riding, they are not directly related to the ability to control riding rhythm. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John decided to travel in the summer vacation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He left his hometown for Venice. (B) He followed some trails and found the way out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He left his hometown for Venice.\nExplanation: The statement clearly states that John decided to travel in the summer vacation. Therefore, it is more plausible that he left his hometown for a destination like Venice, rather than following some trails and finding the way out."}}
{"Q": "He was sentenced to prison. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He surprisingly found that prisoners could read in the reading room and learn about the outside world through TV. (B) He surprisingly the life in rehab is tedious and depressing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is common knowledge that prisoners have access to reading materials and television in the reading room. It is also likely that someone who has never been to prison before would be surprised by this. Option B is less likely because the sentence was to prison, not rehab, and it is not clear why the person would be surprised by the tediousness and depression of rehab if they had never been there before."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought some artifacts in a store. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The store owner got it in a rural place. (B) The store owner said it was made by himself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it explains what happened as a result of Tom buying the artifacts. Option A provides irrelevant information about where the store owner got the artifacts from, but it does not explain what happened as a result of Tom's purchase. Option B, on the other hand, provides a clear outcome - the store owner claimed to have made the artifacts."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to go to space. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He aspired to be an astronaut. (B) He aspired to be a calligrapher.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He aspired to be an astronaut.\nExplanation: Tom's desire to go to space suggests that he has an interest in space exploration and likely wants to become an astronaut. Aspiring to be a calligrapher is not related to space travel and is therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "The man  planned to make Tin  by himslef. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had to design the necessary components. (B) He found cassiterite, carbon and  furnace.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: In order to make tin, the man would need cassiterite (the ore from which tin is extracted), carbon (to reduce the cassiterite to tin), and a furnace (to heat the cassiterite and carbon). Therefore, finding these necessary components would be the most plausible result of his plan to make tin by himself. While designing the necessary components (choice A) may also be necessary, it would not be the immediate result of his plan."}}
{"Q": "Scientists extract substances from plasma. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientist discover crystals. (B) Scientists have extracted all kinds of substances.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Scientists have been able to extract a wide range of substances from plasma, including proteins, enzymes, and antibodies. This has led to significant advancements in medicine and biotechnology, as these substances can be used to develop new treatments and therapies for a variety of diseases and conditions. While the discovery of crystals may be a possible outcome of plasma research, it is not the most likely or significant result."}}
{"Q": "The structure of the soil has changed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He added a lot of Bacillus to the soil. (B) They dig to the subsoil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Digging to the subsoil can disrupt the natural structure of the soil, causing it to change. Adding Bacillus to the soil may have other effects, but it is unlikely to directly change the soil structure."}}
{"Q": "There is several little insects on the tree. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were hunted by the spider. (B) They were hungry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) They were hunted by the spider.\nExplanation: The presence of several little insects on the tree suggests that they were likely feeding on the leaves or bark of the tree. This would attract predators such as spiders who hunt for prey in such environments. Therefore, it is more plausible that the insects were hunted by the spider rather than being hungry."}}
{"Q": "Time passed year after year. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The deflatation happened. (B) The wrinkles on my mother's face are getting more and more.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The wrinkles on my mother's face are getting more and more.\nExplanation: As time passes, people age and their physical appearance changes. Wrinkles are a common sign of aging, and it is plausible that the narrator's mother would have more wrinkles as the years go by. Deflation, on the other hand, is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services in an economy, and it is not necessarily related to the passage of time. Therefore, option (B) is a more likely result of the passage of time."}}
{"Q": "There are many states in the world. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) When he does experiments, he needs to freeze the biological specimens in advance for observation. (B) They all have their own political leaders.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They all have their own political leaders.\nExplanation: The fact that there are many states in the world implies that there are different political entities with their own governments and leaders. This is a logical and plausible answer to the question. Choice (A) is not related to the question and seems to be a non-sequitur."}}
{"Q": "This field benefited. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many people consider philosophy boring. (B) We added fertilizer to this field.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Adding fertilizer to a field is a known method of improving crop yield and overall health of the plants. Therefore, it is more plausible that the field benefited from the addition of fertilizer rather than people's opinions about philosophy."}}
{"Q": "He got immersed in articles about Ammonites. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He looked up information to find out about the extinct relatives of living elephants. (B) John was shocked by the existence of the extinct relatives of modern cephalopods.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The mention of Ammonites being the extinct relatives of living elephants suggests that the person was researching prehistoric animals. Therefore, it is more plausible that he got immersed in articles about Ammonites because he was looking up information to find out about the extinct relatives of living elephants."}}
{"Q": "Sam went to the psychotherapist. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam saw vesicles on her skin. (B) Sam suffered from depression.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that Sam suffered from depression, as psychotherapy is a common treatment for this mental health condition. The presence of vesicles on her skin would likely lead her to seek medical attention from a dermatologist or general practitioner, rather than a psychotherapist."}}
{"Q": "A doctor is saving him from death by defibrillation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This old man was diagonsed with psychosis. (B) The young student is suffering a cardiac arrest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The young student is suffering a cardiac arrest.\nExplanation: Defibrillation is a medical procedure used to treat life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia, which can lead to cardiac arrest. Psychosis, on the other hand, is a mental disorder that affects a person's thoughts, emotions, and behavior, and is not typically treated with defibrillation. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom's car is always drawn by dendrites. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They fly away when Tom tries to approach. (B) Tom measured the length of the dendrites in order to measure the distance between his car and the dendrite.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because dendrites are actually branching extensions of nerve cells, and they cannot physically draw a car. Therefore, it is more likely that the statement is meant to be interpreted figuratively, suggesting that Tom's car is always attracting attention or admiration from others, who are drawn to it like dendrites to a nerve cell. The idea of the dendrites flying away when Tom approaches is a creative and humorous way to express this concept. On the other hand, measuring the length of the dendrites to determine the distance between the car and the dendrite does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Sherry is waiting for her train in the train station. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Coconut tree is a kind of palm tree. (B) Sherry is going to go Shanghai by train.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of Sherry waiting for her train in the train station is that she is going to Shanghai by train. Choice A is not related to the situation and does not provide a plausible cause for Sherry's actions."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought a lot of mangoes and coconuts. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom buys imported tropical fruit every day. (B) The doctor advised Tom to eat more tropical fruits to supplement his vitamins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The doctor's advice is a more plausible reason for Tom to buy a lot of mangoes and coconuts, as it suggests a specific and intentional reason for his purchase. Option A is too general and does not provide a clear reason for Tom's actions."}}
{"Q": "He had to bear their great vocal sounds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The worker in zoo lives with capybaras. (B) Tom had to gather the people.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The worker in zoo lives with capybaras.\nExplanation: Capybaras are known for their loud vocalizations, so it is plausible that the worker in the zoo had to bear their great vocal sounds due to living with them. Option B does not provide any context or explanation for why Tom had to gather people, making it an unlikely answer."}}
{"Q": "He bought a pair of shoes made of rubber. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to protect his ankles when he runs. (B) Jack needed some silicone rubber.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom wants to protect his ankles when he runs.\nExplanation: The fact that the shoes are made of rubber suggests that they are likely running shoes, as rubber is a common material used in the soles of athletic shoes. The mention of protecting his ankles also supports this idea, as running shoes often have ankle support features. Option B, that Jack needed silicone rubber, is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Artificial snow is impossible in summer of Hong Kong. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Small soft white pieces of frozen water melt in hot weather. (B) Rainwater distribution decreases with the increase of mountain altitude.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Small soft white pieces of frozen water melt in hot weather.\nExplanation: Artificial snow is made by spraying water into the air and allowing it to freeze before it falls to the ground. However, in hot weather, the small soft white pieces of frozen water will melt before they reach the ground, making it impossible to create artificial snow. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not relevant to the question as it talks about rainwater distribution and mountain altitude, which are not related to the creation of artificial snow."}}
{"Q": "I saw him swallowing movement. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I noticed the stranger's spitting. (B) He stood under the trees.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I noticed the stranger's spitting.\nExplanation: If the person was seen swallowing repeatedly, it is more likely that they were spitting something out rather than just standing under trees. Standing under trees would not necessarily cause someone to repeatedly swallow."}}
{"Q": "Biologist stand out to protect these significant creatures. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bushbucks are favored by humans, especially hunters. (B) People in this city are destroying the lives of mollusks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions that biologists are standing out to protect bushbucks, which implies that they are facing some threat. The given option (A) states that bushbucks are favored by humans, especially hunters, which is a plausible reason for their population decline and the need for protection. Option (B) talks about mollusks, which is not related to the given statement. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Young kangaroo is placed in the pouch on the abdomen of the female. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mother kangaroo has too much milk. (B) Kangaroos are marsupials.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Kangaroos are marsupials, which means that their young are born in an undeveloped state and must continue to develop outside of the womb. The pouch on the abdomen of the female kangaroo provides a safe and warm environment for the young joey to continue developing until it is ready to fully emerge and explore the world on its own. It has nothing to do with the amount of milk the mother kangaroo has."}}
{"Q": "He wanted to have a more exciting track. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He pulls out the spines that emit venom. (B) He changed the type of track.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that he changed the type of track to make it more exciting rather than pulling out spines that emit venom, which would be dangerous and unnecessary. Changing the track would be a safer and more practical solution to achieve his goal."}}
{"Q": "He buried some seeds in the flowerpot. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Flowers grew soon after. (B) Saguaros grew soon after.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Flowers grew soon after.\nExplanation: Since the seeds were buried in a flowerpot, it is more likely that flowers would grow from them rather than saguaros, which are a type of cactus that typically grow in arid desert regions. Additionally, flowers are a common plant to grow in flowerpots, making it the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They feed ducks every morning. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There live several girls. (B) There are two grey armadillos.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There live several girls.\nExplanation: The fact that there are several girls living there suggests that they may have taken on the responsibility of feeding the ducks as a daily routine or hobby. On the other hand, the presence of two grey armadillos does not seem to have any direct correlation with the feeding of ducks."}}
{"Q": "The sales team will provide different services according to the different needs of customers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The voltage of the electric field has changed. (B) Different customers have different needs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is common for customers to have different needs and preferences, which is why sales teams often provide different services or products to cater to these varying demands. The voltage of the electric field has no relevance to this situation."}}
{"Q": "Tom works hard. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He became an accomplished oncologist. (B) He earns a lot of money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Working hard can lead to various outcomes, but becoming an accomplished oncologist requires specific education and training. On the other hand, earning a lot of money is a more plausible result of working hard, as it can lead to promotions, bonuses, and other financial rewards."}}
{"Q": "The stagnant water in the garden was drained. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Water was storaged in a cistern. (B) The gardener opened the drain in the garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The gardener opened the drain in the garden.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly states that the gardener took action to drain the stagnant water. Option A suggests that the water was intentionally stored in a cistern, which does not explain why it was drained."}}
{"Q": "This girl look for the cookbook to help her. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This girl wants to know the detailed feature of this dish. (B) The octopi was hungry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the girl is looking for a cookbook suggests that she is trying to find a recipe or instructions on how to make a dish. Option B, which suggests that the octopi was hungry, does not provide a logical reason for the girl to be looking for a cookbook. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was shocked by his chemical deficiency. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The food Tom ate contained bacteria. (B) The patient with addiction watched the neuroscientist's lecture.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence mentions a \"chemical deficiency,\" which suggests that something in Tom's body is lacking. Option A, which suggests that Tom ate food containing bacteria, is a more plausible cause of a chemical deficiency than option B, which suggests that a patient with addiction watched a lecture. Bacteria in food can cause a variety of health problems, including chemical imbalances in the body."}}
{"Q": "He can just see something clearly in a short distance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom turned on his flashlight. (B) Tom measured the energy of the lightening during a thunderstorm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom turned on his flashlight.\nExplanation: If Tom can see something clearly in a short distance, it means that there is not enough light in the environment to see clearly. Therefore, turning on a flashlight would provide additional light and allow him to see more clearly. Measuring the energy of lightning during a thunderstorm would not have any effect on Tom's ability to see something clearly in a short distance."}}
{"Q": "Mario wants some flavonoid to paint his shirt. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He releases some swallowtail butterflies. (B) He catches some swallowtail butterflies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Mario wanting flavonoid to paint his shirt would not have any direct correlation with releasing swallowtail butterflies. However, catching swallowtail butterflies could potentially provide him with the flavonoid he needs as some species of swallowtail butterflies contain flavonoids in their wings. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom's shoelaces were lost. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He went to the shop of footwear. (B) He went to buy caulk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He went to the shop of footwear.\nExplanation: If Tom lost his shoelaces, it would make sense for him to go to a shop that sells footwear to buy new ones. Going to buy caulk would not be a logical response to losing shoelaces."}}
{"Q": "Tom was an alcoholic. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom died. (B) He felt ashamed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He felt ashamed.\nExplanation: While alcoholism can lead to serious health problems and even death, the question does not provide enough information to suggest that Tom died as a result of his alcoholism. However, it is likely that he experienced negative consequences such as strained relationships, financial difficulties, and feelings of shame or guilt. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Many anthropologist disagree with him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim holds the division of humankind. (B) Jack is a naturalist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tim holds the division of humankind.\nExplanation: Many anthropologists disagree with Tim because he holds the division of humankind into races, which is a concept that has been widely discredited in the field of anthropology. The idea of race is seen as a social construct rather than a biological reality, and many anthropologists argue that there is more genetic variation within racial groups than between them. Therefore, Tim's belief in the division of humankind into races is not supported by current anthropological research and is a point of disagreement among scholars in the field."}}
{"Q": "Tim is a philosopher. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He studies the fundamental questions of everyday life. (B) He believes in non-hierarchial society.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: As a philosopher, Tim's area of study would be the fundamental questions of everyday life, such as the nature of reality, knowledge, and values. Believing in a non-hierarchical society may be a personal belief or a philosophical stance, but it is not necessarily a direct result of being a philosopher."}}
{"Q": "He found many words subject to shellfishes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is looking up the dictionary. (B) He caught a lungfish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom is looking up the dictionary.\nExplanation: If Tom is looking up words related to shellfishes, it is likely that he is using a dictionary or some other reference material to learn more about them. This would explain why he found many words subject to shellfishes. On the other hand, catching a lungfish would not necessarily lead to discovering many words related to shellfishes."}}
{"Q": "The pistachio is infected with the disease. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It's cloudy today. (B) It has been raining and humid recently.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It has been raining and humid recently.\nExplanation: Pistachio trees are susceptible to fungal diseases, which thrive in moist and humid conditions. Rain and humidity provide the ideal environment for the growth and spread of these diseases, leading to infections in the pistachio trees. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it provides a logical explanation for the cause of the disease. Option A, on the other hand, has no direct correlation with the disease in question."}}
{"Q": "He found bring bulges in the flat disk-like spiral. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He looked at the center of the spiral of the star with Kepler telescope. (B) He looked at the center of the spiral of the tree with Kepler telescope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The question mentions a \"flat disk-like spiral,\" which is a description commonly used for galaxies. Johannes Kepler was an astronomer who studied the motion of planets and stars, and he did not have access to telescopes powerful enough to observe individual trees. Therefore, it is more plausible that he observed a galaxy with bulges in its spiral arms using a telescope, such as the Kepler telescope named after him."}}
{"Q": "The manager immediately found out which uses the best techniques. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The manager browsed only one of the proposals. (B) The manager compared several proposals received.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the manager immediately finding out which uses the best techniques is that they compared several proposals received. If the manager had only browsed one proposal, they would not have had a basis for comparison and would not have been able to determine which proposal used the best techniques. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was diagnosed with Leptospirosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This little man abused inhalants in his life. (B) This boy was exposed to contaminated rat urine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This boy was exposed to contaminated rat urine.\nExplanation: Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that is commonly spread through contact with the urine of infected animals, particularly rats. It is unlikely that inhalant abuse would lead to this diagnosis, making option B the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was prepared to join the parade. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He walked to the bay. (B) Tom went to the street to join the parade.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom went to the street to join the parade.\nExplanation: Since Tom was prepared to join the parade, it is more likely that he would go to the street where the parade is taking place rather than walking to the bay, which is not related to the parade. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was punched and kicked before he died. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A student died in this dormitory. (B) Bob was killed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A student died in this dormitory.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the victim was involved in a fight or altercation with another student, which resulted in him being punched and kicked before he died. On the other hand, the answer \"Bob was killed\" is too vague and does not provide any context or explanation for the cause of the violence."}}
{"Q": "His parents moved to another house in another village. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ruhr took the puppy away from his mother. (B) Tom has sold the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom has sold the house.\nExplanation: The sentence only mentions that the parents moved to another house in another village, but it doesn't provide any information about why they did so. However, option (B) provides a plausible reason for the move, as it suggests that the parents had to move because Tom, presumably the owner of the house, sold it. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the parents' decision to move."}}
{"Q": "Jack is bound to fail. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack tried to make his two terrapins reproroduce their child. (B) Jack tried to make his female terrapin reproroduce his child on her own.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is biologically impossible for a female terrapin to reproduce on her own, so Jack's attempt to make his female terrapin reproduce his child on her own is not only implausible but also impossible. Therefore, this is the more plausible cause of Jack's failure."}}
{"Q": "The scientists found nothing but tarsiers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists want to find the animal with the largest eye among mammals relative to their body weight. (B) Scientists want to find the strongest kind of mammals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that the scientists found nothing but tarsiers suggests that they were specifically looking for an animal with a unique characteristic, such as having the largest eye relative to their body weight. Tarsiers are known for having very large eyes in proportion to their small bodies, making them a likely target for this type of study. The option of looking for the strongest kind of mammals is not relevant to the tarsiers, as they are not known for their strength."}}
{"Q": "It can't be used any more. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The water flew from the community. (B) The uppermost shell of the earth is relatively brittle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The uppermost shell of the earth being relatively brittle is a more plausible cause for something not being able to be used anymore than water flowing from a community. Water flow may cause temporary disruptions, but it can usually be fixed. However, if something can't be used anymore, it suggests a more permanent and significant issue, such as structural damage caused by the brittle uppermost shell of the earth."}}
{"Q": "He took in additional nutrients. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom ate a Broccolis for death. (B) Tom ate a Broccolis for vitamins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tom took in additional nutrients because he ate broccoli for vitamins. Broccoli is known to be a good source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin K, and potassium. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom ate broccoli for its nutritional benefits rather than for death."}}
{"Q": "Jenny's mother called this behavior a crime. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jenny wants to show her strength without restrictions. (B) Tom plucked the strings and the friction between the strings and the air produced vibrations.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions Jenny's behavior being called a crime, which implies that she did something wrong or illegal. Option A suggests that Jenny wants to show her strength without restrictions, which could lead to her engaging in behavior that is harmful or dangerous, and could potentially be considered a crime. Option B, on the other hand, describes the scientific process of how sound is produced, which is not related to criminal behavior. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "One should preserve acids in a bottle with alkalis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Acids should not be preseved with chemicals of cheap prices. (B) Acids should not be preseved with chemicals of opposite features.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Acids should not be preserved with chemicals of opposite features.\nExplanation: Acids and alkalis are opposite in nature and can react with each other to form a neutral substance. This reaction can release heat and potentially cause the container to break or leak. Therefore, it is important to store acids and alkalis separately to prevent any accidental reactions."}}
{"Q": "Now he has a collection of more than 1, 000 toys. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom buys many toys each year. (B) The lonely man began to keep a cute pet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions that \"he has a collection of more than 1,000 toys,\" which implies that he has been accumulating toys over time. Option A states that \"Tom buys many toys each year,\" which is a plausible explanation for how he could have amassed such a large collection. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that the man began keeping a pet, which is not directly related to the collection of toys. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the man's toy collection."}}
{"Q": "He observed the variety in their size. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The photographer saw different species of jackals. (B) Tom observed the development of bulbils in lab.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"variety in their size,\" which suggests that the photographer observed different individuals of the same species. Option A is more plausible because it suggests that the photographer saw different species of jackals, which could explain the variation in size. Option B, on the other hand, talks about observing bulbils in a lab, which is not related to the observation of jackals in the wild."}}
{"Q": "We find that they emphasized characteristics. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We looked at a lot of photographs. (B) Scientists have done a research about nuclei.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that \"we looked at a lot of photographs,\" which suggests that the emphasis on characteristics was a result of visual observation. It is more plausible than option B, which is unrelated to the statement."}}
{"Q": "Tom always felt irregular heart beat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor told him that he had heart palpitations. (B) He was diagnosed with the palpitation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The doctor told him that he had heart palpitations.\nExplanation: Heart palpitations are a common symptom of irregular heartbeats. It is likely that Tom's doctor diagnosed him with heart palpitations after he reported feeling irregular heartbeats. Option A is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to Tom's symptoms and is a common diagnosis for irregular heartbeats. Option B is also correct, but it is less likely to be the first step in the diagnosis process."}}
{"Q": "Tom needs to know the precise audio frequency. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He measured with the unit of megahertz. (B) He used nits.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Tom measured the audio frequency with the unit of megahertz, which is a plausible answer as megahertz is a commonly used unit for measuring frequencies in the audio range. Nits, on the other hand, are a unit of measurement for luminance and have no relevance to audio frequency."}}
{"Q": "He found that neutralization occured. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The physicist gave an electron to a single charged ion. (B) The physicist gave a neutron to a single charged ion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Neutralization occurs when a charged ion gains or loses an electron to become neutral. Option A states that the physicist gave an electron to a single charged ion, which would result in neutralization. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that the physicist gave a neutron to a single charged ion, which would not result in neutralization as neutrons are neutral particles and do not affect the charge of an ion. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lili will choose a branch of systematics to continue her study. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She chooses taxonomy. (B) The water splashed wet people nearby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She chooses taxonomy.\nExplanation: The question states that Lili will choose a branch of systematics to continue her study, implying that she has a specific interest in the field. Therefore, it is more plausible that she would choose a branch of systematics, such as taxonomy, rather than an unrelated event like water splashing on people nearby."}}
{"Q": "Many houses are equipped with heaters. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The result is a lot of gas savings. (B) The purpose of warming up has been achieved.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the purpose of heaters is to warm up houses, and it can be assumed that this purpose has been achieved. The statement does not provide any information about gas savings, so option A cannot be considered a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They have to study for diffent goals of the lessons. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Students listen to different lessons every day. (B) They have to make designs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Students listen to different lessons every day.\nExplanation: It is likely that students have to study for different goals because they are listening to different lessons every day. Each lesson may have its own objectives and learning outcomes, which require students to focus on different skills or knowledge areas. This is a common approach in many educational settings, where teachers design their lessons to meet specific learning goals and tailor their instruction to the needs of their students. On the other hand, option B (They have to make designs) does not necessarily explain why students have to study for different goals, as making designs may be just one aspect of their learning activities."}}
{"Q": "Lilia has a gift for singing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Other ladies are jealous. (B) Although she has not received vocal training, her singing are very skilled.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Although she has not received vocal training, her singing are very skilled.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Lilia's gift for singing. It suggests that Lilia has a natural talent for singing, which is why she is skilled even without formal training. The other option, (A), is less likely because it introduces a negative consequence that is not necessarily related to Lilia's gift for singing."}}
{"Q": "Peter put the mallard in the lake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Its shape ranges from highly irregular to sphere. (B) The mallard swam to the middle of the lake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Based on common knowledge and observation of mallards, it is more plausible that the mallard would swim in the lake after being put in it. Choice A, on the other hand, does not seem to have any logical connection to the action of putting a mallard in a lake."}}
{"Q": "Tom believes in chemiluminescence. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom saw the production of light through a chemical reaction. (B) Tom knows how to apply physical chemical principles to biological systems.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Tom's belief in chemiluminescence is likely due to him witnessing the production of light through a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is well-documented and has been observed in various contexts, such as in fireflies and glow sticks. While knowledge of physical chemical principles may also contribute to understanding chemiluminescence, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for believing in its existence."}}
{"Q": "Her mother always buys minnows. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary likes animals with thick brown fur. (B) Mary likes eating fish very much.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Mary likes eating fish very much.\nExplanation: The fact that Mary's mother always buys minnows suggests that they are being purchased for consumption rather than as pets. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mary's love for fish as a food item is the cause of her mother's consistent purchase of minnows."}}
{"Q": "The docter suggested Phytotherapy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom received treatment using plant products. (B) He applied a design for specific use.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom received treatment using plant products.\nExplanation: Phytotherapy is a form of alternative medicine that uses plant extracts and herbal preparations to treat various ailments. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom received treatment using plant products rather than applying a design for specific use."}}
{"Q": "He have studied al extraterrestrial objects. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom studies physics. (B) Tom is an expert studying astronomy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom is an expert studying astronomy.\nExplanation: The study of extraterrestrial objects falls under the field of astronomy, which is the study of celestial objects and phenomena. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom is an expert in astronomy rather than physics, as the latter does not necessarily focus on the study of space and celestial objects."}}
{"Q": "Many patients were given medication. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Some of them had allergic reactions. (B) The medicine affected the aggregate of lymph nodules.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Some of them had allergic reactions.\nExplanation: Allergic reactions are a common side effect of medication and can occur in some patients. The second option, about the medicine affecting the aggregate of lymph nodules, is not a common or expected side effect of medication and therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "He performs his resposibility with the help of magnetometers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The phycist is responsible for detecting trapped particles around the planet. (B) The phycist is responsible for detecting arbit of the planet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Magnetometers are instruments used to measure magnetic fields. Trapped particles around a planet can create magnetic fields, so a physicist using magnetometers would likely be responsible for detecting these particles. Option B, detecting \"arbit\" of the planet, is not a clear or plausible explanation."}}
{"Q": "We cannogt get clean water from those underground reservoirs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Aquifers were mostly clean. (B) The Aquifers were mostly pollution.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B, as underground reservoirs or aquifers can become polluted due to various human activities such as industrial waste disposal, agricultural runoff, and improper disposal of household waste. This pollution can make the water unsafe for consumption and difficult to treat for clean drinking water. Therefore, it is important to protect and monitor these aquifers to ensure the availability of clean water."}}
{"Q": "Monkeys are particularly abundant in the forests of this habitat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They use their nema-tocysts to capyure prey. (B) The population of monkey is high.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The population of monkey is high.\nExplanation: The statement clearly states that monkeys are abundant in the forests of this habitat, which implies that their population is high. Option (A) is not relevant as nema-tocysts are found in certain species of cnidarians and are used for capturing prey, not in monkeys. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Electricity was conducted to the water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The electric wires fell into the water. (B) This experiment requires a general solvent that can dissolve many substances in nature.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of electricity being conducted to the water is that the electric wires fell into the water, creating a direct path for the electricity to flow through the water. This is a common scenario in which electricity can be conducted to water. The second choice about a general solvent is not relevant to the question and does not explain the cause of electricity being conducted to the water."}}
{"Q": "The radiolarian was observed to be much bigger. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There samples of radiolarian and dinausour teeth were placed under the microscope. (B) There samples of radiolarian and protozoan were placed under the microscope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The comparison of radiolarian size with protozoan size would be more relevant and plausible as both are unicellular organisms and can be compared in terms of size. Comparing radiolarian size with dinosaur teeth would not be relevant as they are completely different organisms."}}
{"Q": "It has been rainy most of the year and the soil is very wet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Muskmelons are not growing well. (B) The water seeps down into the soil and the soil becomes moist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Muskmelons are not growing well.\nExplanation: Muskmelons require well-drained soil and too much moisture can lead to root rot and other diseases, which can hinder their growth. Therefore, it is more plausible that the wet soil is negatively affecting the growth of muskmelons rather than simply becoming more moist."}}
{"Q": "His serious condition needed immediate medical treatment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jerry fainted with a shock. (B) My father has mild to moderate hypertension.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The given statement mentions a serious medical condition that requires immediate treatment. Option A, which suggests that Jerry fainted with a shock, is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any information about the medical condition. On the other hand, option B, which states that the person has mild to moderate hypertension, is a more plausible answer as hypertension is a serious medical condition that requires immediate treatment."}}
{"Q": "He is very pity for this man. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The faithful christian saw Charity. (B) He met a blind man.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The phrase \"He is very pity for this man\" suggests that the man felt sorry for someone, and the most likely reason for this would be meeting a blind man. Option A, \"The faithful christian saw Charity,\" does not make sense in this context as it is unclear who or what Charity refers to. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The chemist added many reagents to the two enantiomers respectively. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) All reagents proved the identical chemical properties of the enantiomers except the optically active reagents. (B) The former has only one cotyledon, while the latter has two cotyledons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Enantiomers have identical chemical and physical properties except for their interaction with optically active reagents, which can distinguish between them based on their different optical rotations. Therefore, it is more plausible that all reagents except optically active ones would show identical chemical properties for both enantiomers. The statement about cotyledons is unrelated to the chemical properties of enantiomers."}}
{"Q": "Linda's father is a builder. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Linda's house is built by her father. (B) His father said grain can be used to make food, sell money, and even make decorations.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The statement implies that Linda's father has the skills and expertise to build houses, so it is more plausible that he built Linda's house rather than discussing the uses of grain."}}
{"Q": "Few people can eliminate their universal human traits in their experience. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor prescribed the methamphetamine immediately. (B) Most people seems to have the trait of ethnocentrism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that universal human traits are difficult to eliminate, implying that most people possess them. The following sentence then introduces the trait of ethnocentrism as an example. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the topic of universal human traits. Option A is not relevant to the context and seems to be a random statement."}}
{"Q": "The size of its antlers has also changed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The male elk gradually grew up. (B) The living environment of lleopards has changed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The male elk gradually grew up.\nExplanation: Antlers are a secondary sexual characteristic of male elk, and they grow and change in size as the male elk matures. As the male elk grows older, its antlers become larger and more elaborate, which helps it attract mates and establish dominance over other males during mating season. Therefore, it is more plausible that the change in antler size was due to the natural process of the male elk growing up, rather than the living environment of leopards, which would not have a direct impact on the growth of antlers in elk."}}
{"Q": "He first studied tulips. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted some flowers to decorate his bedroom. (B) He wanted to study the flowers of the lily family.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He wanted to study the flowers of the lily family.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because tulips belong to the lily family and studying them would be a logical starting point for someone interested in this group of flowers. Choice (A) is less likely because it only provides a personal reason for studying tulips, rather than a botanical or scientific one."}}
{"Q": "The teacher introduced transposition to Czech. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Czech asked the teacher if there were other examples of non-homologous recombination. (B) The teacher would introduce geometric shapes to students.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The introduction of transposition to Czech was likely a result of Czech asking the teacher if there were other examples of non-homologous recombination. This would be a more plausible reason than the teacher randomly deciding to introduce geometric shapes to the students."}}
{"Q": "They weighed a carabao. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The scale shows a few ounces. (B) The scale showed that it was 300kg.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The scale showed that it was 300kg.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because carabaos are known to be large and heavy animals, with an average weight of around 400-600kg. Therefore, it is more likely that the scale would show a weight of 300kg rather than just a few ounces."}}
{"Q": "They shouldn't be exposed to common eradication chemicals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Snails are invertebrates. (B) The security inks should be preserved properly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement is referring to a group of organisms that should not be exposed to common eradication chemicals. This suggests that the organisms are being protected or preserved in some way. Choice B, which mentions the need to preserve security inks properly, is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the chemicals being referred to are used to eradicate the ink and could potentially harm the organisms if they come into contact with them. Choice A, which states that snails are invertebrates, is not relevant to the statement and does not provide a plausible explanation for why the organisms should not be exposed to eradication chemicals."}}
{"Q": "There was one part of the intestine folds in on itself in this patient. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He saw that it was a digestive sac with two openings. (B) The doctor thought he had the intussusception.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Intussusception is a medical condition where one part of the intestine folds in on itself, causing a blockage. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor suspected intussusception as a result of observing this in the patient. Option A is not related to the medical condition and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "I smelt fine flavour. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I cooked the flesh in the kitchen. (B) I sniffed the basil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The word \"smelt\" suggests that the person is referring to a smell, not a taste. Additionally, the mention of basil in choice (B) suggests that it is the more likely cause of the fine flavor. Cooking the flesh in the kitchen (choice A) may produce a smell, but it is not necessarily associated with a fine flavor."}}
{"Q": "The skippers drank the nectar of various flowering plants. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The booming flowers were full of nectar. (B) The skippers are going to look for food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence states that the skippers drank the nectar of various flowering plants, implying that the flowers were abundant with nectar. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the given information. Option B is not a valid explanation as it does not provide any information about the availability of nectar in the flowers."}}
{"Q": "The farmer had a harvest on potatoes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The farmer fertilized the potatoes. (B) The farmer mates his female ox with another male ox.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The farmer fertilized the potatoes.\nExplanation: Fertilizing the potatoes is a common agricultural practice that helps to increase the yield of the crop. It provides essential nutrients to the soil, which in turn helps the potatoes to grow bigger and healthier. Mating a female ox with another male ox has nothing to do with the harvest of potatoes."}}
{"Q": "Tracy's hiuse is in fire. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fireworkers took use of macrozamia. (B) They have found them in legumes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the choices are a plausible answer to the question. \n\nExplanation: The given choices do not provide any logical explanation or connection to the situation presented in the question. Therefore, it is not possible to choose a plausible answer from the given options."}}
{"Q": "John is an experienced thief. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is good at catching mice and other animals. (B) He has stolen something.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He has stolen something.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that John is an experienced thief, which implies that he has stolen something in the past. Option A, which suggests that he is good at catching mice and other animals, is not related to the given information and seems irrelevant. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom doesn't know a few words. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He looked up the dictionary. (B) He can't express himself clearly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: If Tom doesn't know a few words, he may struggle to express himself clearly and may not be able to convey his thoughts and ideas effectively. Looking up the dictionary may help him understand the meaning of those words, but it may not necessarily improve his ability to express himself. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I sent out bullets of different sizes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I used pea seeds as the bullets of my catapult. (B) My husband taught me shotting.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Using pea seeds as bullets of a catapult would result in bullets of different sizes because the seeds would vary in size. This is a plausible explanation for the situation described in the question. On the other hand, the second option of being taught shooting by a husband does not seem to have a direct correlation with the size of the bullets sent out."}}
{"Q": "The police department mobilized all its officers to investigate the case. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A serious criminal case has happened recently. (B) He got a bad cold.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The use of the word \"mobilized\" suggests that the police department is taking urgent action, which is usually done in response to a serious criminal case. Option B, which suggests that the mobilization is due to a personal health issue, is not a plausible explanation for such a large-scale response from the police department."}}
{"Q": "He proves the function of vitality. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bell has a strong viability. (B) Tom's meristem is more sound than others.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that \"he proves the function of vitality\", which implies that Bell is able to demonstrate or showcase the function of vitality. Therefore, option A, which states that Bell has a strong viability, seems like a more plausible answer as it suggests that Bell has a high level of energy or liveliness, which allows him to perform tasks that showcase the function of vitality. Option B, on the other hand, talks about Tom's meristem being more sound than others, which is not directly related to the function of vitality."}}
{"Q": "He has a lot of experience in mountaineering. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He gave a lot of advice to the climbers. (B) He tried many things that he had never experienced before.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that someone with a lot of experience in mountaineering would give advice to other climbers rather than trying things they have never experienced before. Experience in mountaineering would give them knowledge and skills that they could share with others to help them succeed in their climbs."}}
{"Q": "He made me a rattle. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My grandpa attached the hard hollow segments loosely. (B) He touches people's bodies without their agreement.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My grandpa attached the hard hollow segments loosely.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the creation of the rattle. Option B is unrelated and suggests inappropriate behavior, which is not supported by the given information. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the rattle being made."}}
{"Q": "The rats under investigation showed ischemic renal injury. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Teachers provided them with enations from rats. (B) They were injected with Polymerase to alleviate the symptom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They were injected with Polymerase to alleviate the symptom.\nExplanation: Ischemic renal injury refers to damage to the kidneys due to reduced blood flow. Polymerase is not a treatment for this condition, but it is possible that it was used as a treatment to alleviate the symptoms or to study the effects of the injury on the rats. Enations from rats (choice A) is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the treatment of ischemic renal injury."}}
{"Q": "The child eats cereals every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is healthy. (B) He was healthy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He is healthy.\nExplanation: Eating cereals every day is a healthy habit as it provides essential nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that the child is currently healthy due to this habit. However, it is important to note that other factors like overall diet and lifestyle also play a significant role in determining one's health."}}
{"Q": "People there have no literacy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They can not understand the words on paper or wirte any words. (B) They can not write but they can read papers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They can not understand the words on paper or write any words.\nExplanation: Literacy refers to the ability to read and write. If people have no literacy, it means they cannot read or write. Therefore, they would not be able to understand the words on paper or write any words themselves. Option B is not plausible because if someone cannot write, it is unlikely that they would be able to read papers as well."}}
{"Q": "The docter said that was just after image. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack said he could see some spots in his field of vision. (B) The saint looked up to physical manifestation of deity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Jack's complaint of seeing spots in his field of vision is a more plausible cause for the doctor's diagnosis of after image. After images are visual illusions that occur when the eyes continue to see an image after it has been removed. This can happen due to overstimulation of the retina, which can occur when looking at bright lights or staring at a fixed point for too long. Seeing spots in one's field of vision is a common symptom of after images. On the other hand, the physical manifestation of a deity is not a common occurrence and is not a likely cause for after images."}}
{"Q": "Tom is planning to rob the bank. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is always answering the phone. (B) Tom needs money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom needs money.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it provides a clear motive for Tom's plan to rob the bank. If Tom is in dire need of money, he may see robbing a bank as a way to solve his financial problems. On the other hand, choice (A) about Tom always answering the phone does not provide any logical connection to his plan to rob a bank."}}
{"Q": "Tony uses his toothbrush twice a day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tony's teeth are very healthy. (B) The minister's response is expected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tony's teeth are very healthy.\nExplanation: Brushing teeth twice a day is a recommended dental hygiene practice. By following this routine, Tony is likely to have healthy teeth and gums, which can prevent dental problems such as cavities and gum disease. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B is unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The worker fainted for having food containing Terbium. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor gave him an injection of tranquilizer. (B) He was diagnoised as a  moderately toxic state.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Terbium is a rare earth element that can be toxic to humans if ingested in large amounts. Symptoms of terbium toxicity include nausea, vomiting, and dizziness, which can lead to fainting. Therefore, it is more plausible that the worker was diagnosed as being in a moderately toxic state rather than being given a tranquilizer injection."}}
{"Q": "This dish has a strong aroma. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This dish is steamed. (B) This dish is heavily spiced.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the dish is heavily spiced. Spices are known to have strong aromas and can greatly affect the smell of a dish. Steaming a dish may not necessarily result in a strong aroma, unless the ingredients used have a strong smell."}}
{"Q": "He found many levels overlapped like petals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is interested in the stems which are eusteles. (B) Tom stared at the nasturtium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that Tom \"found many levels overlapped like petals,\" which suggests that he was looking at a flower. The mention of \"petals\" is a clue that the flower in question is likely the nasturtium mentioned in choice B. Choice A, on the other hand, mentions stems and eusteles, which are not directly related to the description of overlapping levels like petals. Therefore, choice B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Fox and rabbit in this stroy are in the place of people. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This story belongs to a fable. (B) It is evening.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The use of animals as characters in a story is a common feature of fables, which are stories that often have a moral lesson or message. In this case, the fox and rabbit are used to represent human behavior and interactions, and the story likely has a lesson or message for readers to learn from. Therefore, choice A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought medicine for sties. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bacteria on Tom's hand infected tear ducts. (B) The pure water on Tom's hand infected tear ducts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The bacteria on Tom's hand infected tear ducts.\nExplanation: Sties are usually caused by a bacterial infection of the oil glands in the eyelids. It is unlikely that pure water would cause an infection, so option B is not a plausible answer. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of Tom's sties."}}
{"Q": "The doctor found that her eye's clear lens to become cloudy blocking light. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boss is on the phone with the manager. (B) She got a cataract.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that she got a cataract, as this is a common condition where the clear lens of the eye becomes cloudy, causing vision problems. Choice A, that the boss is on the phone with the manager, is unrelated and unlikely to cause a cataract."}}
{"Q": "This poor girl has suffered from leukemia. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Basophils cause some allergic diseases. (B) The number of basophils in this poor girl is outside the bounds of normality.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, causing an abnormal increase in the number of white blood cells, including basophils. Therefore, the cause of leukemia is not related to basophils causing allergic diseases, but rather an abnormal increase in the number of basophils in the body."}}
{"Q": "Usually the marble-like lumps of tissue of these patients are harmless. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Part of the nutrients in the patient's body were depleted. (B) Many patients with fibroadenomas come for treatment in this hospital.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Part of the nutrients in the patient's body were depleted.\nExplanation: Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors that are composed of both glandular and connective tissue. The exact cause of fibroadenomas is unknown, but it is believed that hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty or pregnancy, may play a role. It is unlikely that the high number of patients with fibroadenomas coming to the hospital is the cause of the marble-like lumps of tissue in these patients. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the development of fibroadenomas may be related to a depletion of certain nutrients in the body."}}
{"Q": "Mary and her cow are pregnant in the same month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After nine months, she and her cow will give birth to babies. (B) After one month, she will give birth to babies but not her cow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) After nine months, she and her cow will give birth to babies.\nExplanation: Both Mary and her cow being pregnant in the same month indicates that they were impregnated around the same time. As cows have a gestation period of around nine months, it is likely that both Mary and her cow will give birth to their babies after nine months. Option (B) is not plausible as humans have a gestation period of around nine months, and it is not possible for Mary to give birth after just one month."}}
{"Q": "He bought an avocado. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bought a booklet. (B) His mother asked him to buy a green vegetable.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His mother asked him to buy a green vegetable.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because avocados are often considered a type of vegetable and are green in color. Additionally, the fact that his mother specifically asked him to buy a green vegetable suggests that he intentionally chose to buy an avocado as a result of her request. On the other hand, option (A) is unlikely as there is no clear connection between buying a booklet and buying an avocado."}}
{"Q": "Telecommuning is widely employed by many companies due to the outbreak of epidemic. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People stay at home working and communicating with colleagues. (B) People prefer to work in companies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Due to the outbreak of epidemic, many companies have implemented telecommuting as a way to continue business operations while keeping employees safe. This has resulted in people staying at home and working remotely, communicating with colleagues through various online platforms. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They found that it produced the lactase. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor monitored the human body. (B) The researcher observed that compound leaves fall from the trees.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The doctor monitored the human body.\nExplanation: The production of lactase is a biological process that occurs within the human body. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor monitored the human body to determine the cause of lactase production rather than a researcher observing compound leaves falling from trees, which has no direct correlation to lactase production."}}
{"Q": "Mary was one of the runner this time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her face looks not as red as she just started jogging. (B) Mary participated in km tme trials.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Mary was one of the runners, but it does not provide any information about her participation in km time trials. However, it does mention that her face looks not as red as she just started jogging, which suggests that she has been running for a while and her body has adjusted to the exercise. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom hopes to build up his physique. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He drinks a lot of probiotic juice. (B) He exercised for a long time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom would build up his physique by exercising for a long time rather than drinking a lot of probiotic juice. Exercise is a well-known way to build muscle and improve overall physical fitness, while probiotic juice may have some health benefits but is not directly linked to building muscle."}}
{"Q": "Susan took some doxycycline. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She became more sensitive to the smell of flowers after a few hours. (B) She became more sensitive to the stimulation of the sun after a few hours.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Doxycycline is an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections. It works by inhibiting the growth and spread of bacteria in the body. It does not have any known effects on sensitivity to sunlight or other environmental stimuli. However, some people have reported increased sensitivity to smells after taking doxycycline, which is a possible side effect. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He expressed himself through dance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is a dancer. (B) Mike wanted to feel what it felt like to move through the air.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom is a dancer.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"he expressed himself through dance,\" which implies that the person in question has experience and skill in dancing. Therefore, option A, which states that \"Tom is a dancer,\" is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests that Mike wanted to experience a sensation of movement."}}
{"Q": "Tom is trying to make a plywood. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got some lancelets. (B) He is cutting a thin continous layer of wood off a log as it is spins around.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer as it describes the process of making plywood, which involves cutting thin continuous layers of wood off a log as it spins around. Option A, on the other hand, is unrelated to the process of making plywood and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The man deals with sales. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Meeting people is part of his job. (B) He is part of the market.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Meeting people is part of his job.\nExplanation: Since the man deals with sales, it is likely that he has to interact with potential customers and clients in order to sell products or services. Therefore, meeting people is a necessary part of his job. Option B, on the other hand, is not necessarily true as being part of the market could refer to anyone who is a consumer or potential buyer, not just someone who works in sales."}}
{"Q": "Tom's gas cooker won't work. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His disease deteriorate slowly but continuously. (B) He started the fire with a piece of paper.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer as it directly relates to the gas cooker not working. Starting a fire with a piece of paper is not a safe or effective way to ignite a gas cooker and could potentially cause damage to the appliance. Option A is unrelated to the situation and does not make sense as a result of a malfunctioning gas cooker."}}
{"Q": "This area is affected by the drought. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Why there are little seagrasses here? (B) A long period passes without substantial rainfall in this area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) A long period passes without substantial rainfall in this area.\nExplanation: Drought is defined as a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water. Therefore, the most plausible cause of the area being affected by drought is a long period without substantial rainfall. The lack of seagrasses may be a consequence of the drought, but it is not the cause."}}
{"Q": "The clothes of this brand sell well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The clothes of this brand are of good quality. (B) Owls have good night vision.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The clothes of this brand are of good quality.\nExplanation: The sentence talks about the success of a brand's clothes, and the reason given is that they sell well. The most plausible reason for clothes to sell well is that they are of good quality, which would attract customers and lead to positive word-of-mouth recommendations. The second choice about owls' night vision is unrelated and does not provide a logical explanation for the success of the brand's clothes."}}
{"Q": "He said he saw a hellhound running on the street. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I knew he told a lie. (B) I believed what he said.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Without any evidence to the contrary, it is more plausible to believe that the person saw a hellhound running on the street rather than assuming they lied. It is important to consider the possibility of supernatural or paranormal occurrences, as well as the fact that people may have different perceptions and experiences."}}
{"Q": "Tom was eating the muskmelon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He felt the musk smell. (B) He felt thirsty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Muskmelons are known for their strong musky aroma, which is why they are called muskmelons. When Tom ate the muskmelon, he would have definitely felt the musk smell. It is a more plausible answer than feeling thirsty, as muskmelons are also known for their high water content, which can actually quench thirst."}}
{"Q": "Tom got some zooids. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The zookeeper fed them with water. (B) He uses them for tentacles research.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He uses them for tentacles research.\nExplanation: The word \"zooids\" refers to small, individual organisms that make up a larger colonial organism, such as in some types of jellyfish or coral. It is unlikely that a zookeeper would feed them with water, as water is a basic necessity for all living organisms. On the other hand, it is plausible that Tom, who may be a scientist or researcher, would acquire zooids for the purpose of studying their tentacles. Tentacles are a defining feature of many colonial organisms, and studying them could provide valuable insights into their behavior and ecology."}}
{"Q": "Tom relinquished his citizenship of his motherland. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom became a citizen of another country. (B) Conflicts between the natives and the immigrants increased.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom became a citizen of another country.\nExplanation: When someone relinquishes their citizenship of one country, it means they are renouncing their allegiance to that country and giving up their rights and privileges as a citizen. In most cases, this means that the person is becoming a citizen of another country, either by naturalization or by birth. It is unlikely that conflicts between natives and immigrants would increase as a direct result of Tom relinquishing his citizenship, as this is a personal decision that does not affect the larger population."}}
{"Q": "They dissected the ovaries in their anatomy class. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They increased the size of the class. (B) By mistake, they dissected the kidney next to it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) They increased the size of the class.\nExplanation: Dissecting the ovaries in an anatomy class would not result in accidentally dissecting a kidney next to it. It is more likely that the class size increased as more students were interested in observing the dissection of the ovaries."}}
{"Q": "These strangers were vile intruders. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These strangers invaded the farmers’ home. (B) These kids were playing in the park.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) These strangers invaded the farmers’ home.\nExplanation: The word \"intruders\" implies that these strangers were not welcome and had entered a space without permission. The use of the word \"vile\" suggests that their actions were unpleasant or harmful. Therefore, it is more plausible that these strangers invaded the farmers' home rather than innocent kids playing in a park."}}
{"Q": "We saw Vegetation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They did an experiment about aeration. (B) We came to the boundary of the wildlife habitat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If the vegetation was seen at the boundary of a wildlife habitat, it is more likely that the presence of vegetation is due to the natural growth of plants in that area rather than an experiment about aeration. Wildlife habitats are known to have a diverse range of plant species, which could explain the presence of vegetation."}}
{"Q": "The adhesives producing factory forgot to add rubber silicone acrylic into the its new products. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These products didn't function as they used to do. (B) Tom goes to a chemist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. These products didn't function as they used to do.\nExplanation: Rubber silicone acrylic is an important component in adhesives as it provides flexibility and durability. Without it, the adhesives would not be able to bond properly and may not have the same strength and longevity as before. Therefore, it is likely that the products would not function as they were intended to. Option B about Tom going to a chemist is not related to the given scenario and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This habitat has been occupied by them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Hedgehogs were rampant in this mountain. (B) There are a lot of donkeys in that area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Hedgehogs were rampant in this mountain.\nExplanation: Hedgehogs are known to inhabit mountainous areas and are capable of occupying habitats for extended periods of time. Donkeys, on the other hand, are not typically found in mountainous regions and would not be a plausible explanation for the occupation of this habitat."}}
{"Q": "The protagonist is growing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plot changes with it. (B) He has to follow the change of atmosphere constantly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: As the protagonist grows, their perspective and actions change, which in turn affects the plot. The plot must adapt to the protagonist's growth and development, making option A the more plausible answer. Option B may be true in some cases, but it is not necessarily a direct result of the protagonist's growth."}}
{"Q": "The photographer took use of proper light. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He takes a perfect photo. (B) He created a environment similar to the general areas for other wide geckos.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Proper use of light can greatly enhance the quality of a photograph by providing the necessary illumination and highlighting the subject in the best possible way. While creating an environment similar to the general areas for other wide geckos may be important for a different purpose, it is not directly related to the impact of proper lighting on photography. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Astronauts wear spacesuits with lithium hydroxide canisters to work in space. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their exhaled carbon dioxide combines with lithium hydroxide to produce water and purify the air around them. (B) Spacesuits keep them from being affected by gravity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Lithium hydroxide canisters in spacesuits are used to remove carbon dioxide from the air that astronauts breathe. The exhaled carbon dioxide reacts with lithium hydroxide to produce water and lithium carbonate, which is then stored in the canister. This process helps to purify the air and maintain a breathable atmosphere inside the spacesuit. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Option B is incorrect because spacesuits do not protect astronauts from the effects of gravity, but rather provide them with a pressurized environment to survive in the vacuum of space."}}
{"Q": "The mountain goat has strong hooves for running up the rocky slopes of the mountains. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The mountain goat lives in the mountainous regions. (B) The development of some wolves is blocked.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The mountain goat lives in the mountainous regions.\nExplanation: The mountain goat's strong hooves are an adaptation to its environment. Living in mountainous regions with rocky slopes requires the ability to climb and run on uneven terrain. Therefore, the cause of the mountain goat's strong hooves is its habitat and the need to survive in that environment. Choice B, the development of some wolves being blocked, is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the mountain goat's physical adaptation."}}
{"Q": "The zookeeper raised many animals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She has seen their growth in different times. (B) The zookeeper fed them with milk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since the zookeeper raised many animals, it is likely that she has seen their growth in different times. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which only mentions feeding them with milk and does not necessarily relate to the outcome of raising the animals."}}
{"Q": "Tom was a diabetic when he was 13. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Doctor thinks Tom has insomnia. (B) He had impotence when he was 25.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He had impotence when he was 25.\nExplanation: Diabetes can cause damage to blood vessels and nerves, which can lead to erectile dysfunction (impotence) in men. Insomnia is not a common complication of diabetes."}}
{"Q": "There is Nadolol as an effective choice in all his medicine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack is an optician. (B) My father has mild to moderate hypertension.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Nadolol is a beta blocker medication commonly used to treat hypertension. Therefore, it is a plausible choice for someone with mild to moderate hypertension like Jack's father. Option A, stating that Jack is an optician, is not relevant to the medication choice."}}
{"Q": "Pycnidia grows around Tom's wound. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's wound is exposed to fungus. (B) Tom forgot to clean the infected area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Pycnidia are small, flask-shaped structures that produce and release fungal spores. They are commonly found in fungal infections, particularly those caused by Ascomycota fungi. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's wound is exposed to fungus, rather than him forgetting to clean the infected area, as poor hygiene alone is not enough to cause the growth of pycnidia."}}
{"Q": "Only those in certain ranges could see the tides. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Great tides overwhelmed my sight. (B) The coast were filled with visitors for tides.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that only those in certain ranges could see the tides, which implies that the tides were so great that they could only be seen from a certain distance. Therefore, option A, \"Great tides overwhelmed my sight,\" is a more plausible answer than option B, \"The coast were filled with visitors for tides,\" which does not explain why only certain people could see the tides."}}
{"Q": "Jim faces the stress of finding a job. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He often gets cramps. (B) He is too distressed to sleep at night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jim's stress of finding a job would lead to him being too distressed to sleep at night, rather than getting cramps. Insomnia and difficulty sleeping are common symptoms of stress and anxiety, while cramps are not typically associated with job search stress."}}
{"Q": "Our teacher pointed out our thought was wrong. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We were ready to go take some nice pictures. (B) We thought macromolecules were scant in cells.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Our teacher pointed out our thought was wrong because we thought macromolecules were scant in cells, which is not true. This shows that we had a misconception or lack of knowledge about the topic, leading to an incorrect assumption."}}
{"Q": "A stove is an enclosed space in which fuel is burned to provide heating. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Its surfaces protect people from hurting. (B) The electrons tiny charged particles inside atoms carried the heat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Its surfaces protect people from hurting.\nExplanation: When fuel is burned in a stove, it produces heat which can be dangerous to people if they come into contact with it. However, the stove is designed with enclosed surfaces that protect people from getting burned or hurt by the heat. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the purpose of a stove and its design. Option B is not relevant to the question as it talks about the movement of electrons, which is not directly related to the function of a stove."}}
{"Q": "Thunder appears in the sky at once. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The clouds are very thick in the sky. (B) Lightning rapidly heats and expands the surrounding air.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Thunder is the sound produced by lightning. When lightning strikes, it rapidly heats and expands the surrounding air, creating a shock wave that we hear as thunder. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer than option A, which only describes the thickness of the clouds and does not explain the cause of thunder."}}
{"Q": "She blamed herself for failure to solve such a natural thing in child's development. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Miss Li's managemant of her class was too strict. (B) Amy didn't deal with the tantrum of her son very well.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Amy didn't deal with the tantrum of her son very well.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the cause of her blaming herself was related to the failure to solve a natural thing in a child's development. Tantrums are a common occurrence in child development, and it is possible that Amy didn't handle her son's tantrum well, leading to her feeling responsible for the failure. There is no mention of Miss Li's management of the class being a factor in this situation. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He found the latter has a much wider ranges of distribution. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The botanist specialized in vascular plants investigated bryohytes. (B) Tom looked at the arterioles with the naked eye and with a microscope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The botanist specialized in vascular plants investigated bryophytes.\nExplanation: Bryophytes are non-vascular plants, while vascular plants have specialized tissues for conducting water and nutrients. Therefore, it is likely that the botanist's investigation of bryophytes, which have a more limited range of distribution, led to the observation that the latter (vascular plants) have a much wider range of distribution. Option B, which refers to Tom's observation of arterioles, is not relevant to the statement about the wider range of distribution of vascular plants."}}
{"Q": "The room is cooling a little bit. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom bought an oven. (B) Timothy brings some sulfates into the living room.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Sulfates are known to have a cooling effect on the atmosphere, so it is more plausible that Timothy bringing sulfates into the living room caused the cooling rather than Tom buying an oven, which would likely have the opposite effect."}}
{"Q": "The anole climbed out along the wall of the glass cabinet and ran away. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Peter kept a anole in a glass cabinet. (B) The alien was blocked from water, air  and dust.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Peter kept an anole in a glass cabinet.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that there was an anole in the glass cabinet, and it climbed out and ran away. There is no mention of an alien or any other factor that could have caused the anole to escape. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Peter kept the anole in the glass cabinet and it escaped on its own."}}
{"Q": "Jack's mother learns that Jack has an appointment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Time goes on. (B) Jack's mother peeks at Jack's diary.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack's appointment was scheduled in advance and as time went on, Jack's mother became aware of it rather than her invading Jack's privacy by peeking at his diary."}}
{"Q": "Tom found a wooden bar to fire the paper. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He started to produce heat with the friction of the bar. (B) He started to produce heat with the moisture of the bar.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He started to produce heat with the friction of the bar.\nExplanation: When two objects rub against each other, they create friction, which generates heat. In this case, Tom is rubbing the paper against the wooden bar, which creates friction and produces heat. Moisture in the bar would not have any significant effect on producing heat in this scenario. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His mother gave him a ladybug. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He told his mother that he wanted a beetle. (B) He needed a hard brittle lustrous dense transition metal of the platinum family.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that he told his mother that he wanted a beetle, and she gave him a ladybug as a substitute. Ladybugs are often mistaken for beetles due to their similar appearance, and it is common for parents to make substitutions when fulfilling their children's requests. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the situation and does not make sense in the context."}}
{"Q": "The results showed she was infected with streptococcus. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary's white blood cell count was significantly lower. (B) The patient has been infected with hepatitis b virus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Mary's white blood cell count was significantly lower.\nExplanation: Streptococcus is a type of bacteria that can cause infections such as strep throat, pneumonia, and skin infections. A low white blood cell count can weaken the immune system and make it easier for bacteria like streptococcus to cause an infection. Hepatitis B virus is a completely different type of infection and would not be the cause of a streptococcus infection. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They  went to the theater. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They were hungry. (B) They found it's a room surrounded by walls.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the choices are a plausible result of going to the theater. It is unclear what happened as a result of them going to the theater without further context."}}
{"Q": "She got the frequency of the sound. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Madame Curie studied radium all her life. (B) My mentor calculated the number of recurring periodic waves in one second.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: My mentor calculated the number of recurring periodic waves in one second is a more plausible answer as it suggests that someone with knowledge and expertise in sound waves was able to determine the frequency. Madame Curie's expertise was in radioactivity, not sound waves, so it is less likely that she would have been able to accurately determine the frequency of a sound."}}
{"Q": "Mary felt the extrusion of a mass through her vagina. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor told her it was a common physiological response. (B) The docter diagnoised her with prolapse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The doctor diagnosed her with prolapse.\nExplanation: The extrusion of a mass through the vagina is a common symptom of prolapse, which occurs when the pelvic organs (such as the uterus, bladder, or rectum) descend into or outside of the vaginal canal. It is unlikely that a doctor would dismiss this symptom as a common physiological response without further investigation or diagnosis. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lucy eats barley every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was healthy. (B) She keeps a healthy state.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She was healthy.\nExplanation: Barley is a nutritious grain that is high in fiber, protein, and various vitamins and minerals. Eating barley every day can contribute to a healthy diet and may help prevent certain health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that Lucy's regular consumption of barley contributed to her overall health. However, it is important to note that other factors such as exercise and overall diet also play a role in maintaining good health."}}
{"Q": "Scientists pick one out of thousands of breeds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mathematician met a math problem. (B) Farmers want to grow sweeter oranges.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that scientists picked one breed out of thousands, which implies that they were trying to select a specific trait or characteristic. Option B, \"Farmers want to grow sweeter oranges,\" is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the scientists were trying to develop a breed of oranges that had a sweeter taste. This is a common goal for farmers and scientists who work in agriculture, as they are always looking for ways to improve the quality and yield of their crops. Option A, \"The mathematician met a math problem,\" is not a plausible answer as it has no connection to the statement and does not provide any explanation for why scientists would pick one breed out of thousands."}}
{"Q": "He begins to bleed in the nose. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom smokes all the year. (B) Eating lobsters makes Luke allergic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Nosebleeds can be caused by a variety of factors, including allergies. Eating lobsters could potentially trigger an allergic reaction in Luke, leading to a nosebleed. While smoking can also cause nosebleeds, there is no indication in the given information that Tom is present or relevant to the situation. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom gave his patient a barbiturates injection in order to relieve his pain during the operation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was happy and perform in a better way. (B) The patient still suffered from serious pain.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Barbiturates are a type of sedative that can help relieve pain and induce sleep. Therefore, it is more plausible that the patient's pain was relieved after receiving the injection. However, it is important to note that barbiturates can also have side effects such as drowsiness, confusion, and slowed breathing, so it is important for the patient to be closely monitored by medical professionals."}}
{"Q": "Alice gave Lucy a call. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She told Lucy a lot of news. (B) Lucy was disfigured.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence only states that Alice gave Lucy a call, it does not provide any information about Lucy being disfigured. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as Alice could have told Lucy a lot of news during the call."}}
{"Q": "Tom ate a lot of pots of brambles this year. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's crops were eaten by insects. (B) Tom sowed bramble seeds last year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom sowed bramble seeds last year, as this would explain why he had a lot of brambles to eat this year. Option A, that Tom's crops were eaten by insects, would not explain why he had so many brambles to eat."}}
{"Q": "They finally made a new mental containing titanium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The factory needed to improve the quality of production. (B) Scientists are studying a new type of material to make spacecraft.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The mention of titanium being used for spacecraft suggests that scientists are studying a new type of material for space exploration. The option of the factory needing to improve production quality does not seem relevant to the context provided. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jessy flattened the blanket on her bed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The colorful pillows of the blanket faces up. (B) The colorful surface of the blanket faces up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The colorful surface of the blanket faces up.\nExplanation: When Jessy flattened the blanket on her bed, the colorful surface of the blanket would naturally face up, as that is the side meant to be seen and used. The pillows mentioned in choice A are likely separate from the blanket and would not be affected by the act of flattening the blanket."}}
{"Q": "People on the street didn't get wet even without an umbrella. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It has been hailing heavily outside for a few hours. (B) Too many international activities were held in this city.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If it has been hailing heavily outside for a few hours, people on the street wouldn't get wet even without an umbrella because the hailstones would provide cover from the rain. On the other hand, international activities being held in the city have no correlation with people not getting wet without an umbrella. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "These two species benefit from their interaction. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The environment becomes better. (B) They achieved Mutualism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They achieved Mutualism.\nExplanation: Mutualism is a type of symbiotic relationship where both species benefit from their interaction. Therefore, if two species are benefiting from their interaction, it is likely that they have achieved mutualism. Option A is not necessarily true as the environment may or may not be affected by their interaction."}}
{"Q": "Waterwheels satrted work efficiently. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The mills can set to work. (B) The scientists have invented replacements.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The mills can set to work.\nExplanation: Waterwheels were commonly used to power mills for grinding grain, sawing wood, and other industrial processes. When waterwheels started working efficiently, it meant that the mills could operate more effectively and produce more goods. This would have had a significant impact on the local economy and the availability of goods for trade and consumption. There is no indication in the question that scientists have invented replacements, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A biologist measured the amount of venom used by rattlesnakes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got the quantity. (B) He found that its amount could be adjusted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: The statement suggests that the biologist conducted an experiment to measure the amount of venom used by rattlesnakes. Therefore, it is more plausible that he found that the amount of venom could be adjusted rather than simply getting the quantity. This finding could have important implications for understanding the behavior and ecology of rattlesnakes."}}
{"Q": "Alice eats some health products containing antacids. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice felt headache. (B) The painkillers he took before have failed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The painkillers he took before have failed.\nExplanation: Antacids are used to neutralize stomach acid and relieve heartburn, indigestion, and acid reflux. They do not typically cause headaches. However, if Alice had taken painkillers for a headache before taking the antacids, the antacids may have interfered with the absorption of the painkillers, causing them to be less effective. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "People can always recognize aardvark easily. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Aardwolf show its butt. (B) Aardvark always looks different from other sea creatures.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions nothing about sea creatures, so option B is irrelevant. On the other hand, aardwolves are known to show their butts as a defense mechanism, but this has nothing to do with aardvarks being easily recognizable. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The naughty boy knew his sistar hate animals with big mouths. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He pulls out the spines that emit venom. (B) He caught a bass to scare her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the naughty boy caught a bass to scare his sister, as it is a common fish with a large mouth that could potentially scare someone who hates animals with big mouths. Pulling out spines that emit venom is unlikely and dangerous."}}
{"Q": "Water is formed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A singly charged ion gains an electron. (B) Jack breaks down hydrogen peroxide.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Water is formed when hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is broken down into water (H2O) and oxygen (O2) by an enzyme called catalase. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it directly involves the formation of water. Option A is not a correct answer as the gain of an electron by a singly charged ion does not result in the formation of water."}}
{"Q": "His skin was caustised. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom often touches the tin bar without any protection. (B) Jack keeps frictioning his arm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom often touches the tin bar without any protection.\nExplanation: Caustic substances can cause chemical burns on the skin. Tin is a metal that can react with acids and cause a caustic reaction. If Tom often touches the tin bar without any protection, he may have come into contact with the caustic substance and caused a chemical burn on his skin. Frictioning the arm, as in option B, may cause irritation or abrasions on the skin, but it is less likely to cause a caustic reaction."}}
{"Q": "Geese spend a lot of time staying in their nests. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Geese build their nests carefully. (B) Geese usually build their nests near the water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Geese spend a lot of time staying in their nests, which means they need to build their nests carefully to ensure they are safe and comfortable for their eggs and young. Building a sturdy and well-insulated nest is crucial for the survival of their offspring. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B may be true, but it is not directly related to the fact that geese spend a lot of time in their nests."}}
{"Q": "As the environment deteriorates, the mass of the star decreases. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It becomes less bright than before. (B) The same is true of galaxy clusters.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It becomes less bright than before.\nExplanation: The mass of a star is directly related to its luminosity or brightness. As the mass of the star decreases, its luminosity also decreases. This is because the energy produced by the star is directly proportional to its mass. Therefore, a decrease in mass results in a decrease in energy output and hence a decrease in brightness. The statement about galaxy clusters is not related to the given scenario and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The guide adviced the tourists to have a rest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The guide lead the tourists to climb the mountain. (B) The traffic was very busy on the city streets.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The guide advised the tourists to have a rest because they had just climbed the mountain. Climbing a mountain can be physically demanding and tiring, so it is important to take breaks and rest to avoid exhaustion or injury. Option B, about busy city streets, does not seem relevant to the situation described in the question."}}
{"Q": "They used several different materials. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They are asked to make composites. (B) Their group was in charge of the gelatin Infiltration.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They are asked to make composites.\nExplanation: Making composites involves combining different materials to create a new material with improved properties. Therefore, it is plausible that the group used several different materials because they were asked to make composites. On the other hand, the fact that their group was in charge of the gelatin infiltration does not necessarily explain why they used several different materials."}}
{"Q": "Mike's parents sent Mike to learn decryption. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They remained silent. (B) Mike learned to reverse the unintelligible data into meaningful data using a key.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mike learned decryption as a result of his parents sending him to learn it. Decryption involves the process of reversing unintelligible data into meaningful data using a key, so it makes sense that this is what Mike learned. Choice A, that his parents remained silent, does not provide any explanation or outcome of Mike's learning experience."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a peel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Since then, Tom's skin has become red. (B) His lung functions were seriously affected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: A peel is a skin condition that causes redness and irritation. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's skin has become red as a result of having a peel rather than his lung functions being affected."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has bought a professional book. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She firstly gave a look at the guideline. (B) She extremely likes her trainer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She firstly gave a look at the guideline.\nExplanation: Since Lucy has bought a professional book, it is more likely that she would first look at the guideline to understand the content and structure of the book. It is not relevant to mention her liking for the trainer in this context."}}
{"Q": "Metals with high conductivity can be used to make wires. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Copper, tin and aluminum are all good choices. (B) Machines become more effective using these materials.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Copper, tin, and aluminum are all metals with high conductivity and are commonly used to make wires. This is because they allow electricity to flow through them with minimal resistance, making them ideal for transmitting electrical signals. While machines may become more effective using these materials, the question specifically asks about the use of high conductivity metals for making wires. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lily has conflict with Lucy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their friends mediate their conflicts. (B) Feeder attributes it to their frequent predation behavior.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that their friends would mediate their conflicts rather than a feeder attributing it to their predation behavior. Conflict resolution through mediation is a common practice among friends and acquaintances."}}
{"Q": "There are many dwarfism patients. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Most of them have achondroplasia. (B) The number of pathogenic microorganisms increased rapidly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, accounting for about 70% of cases. It is caused by a genetic mutation that affects bone growth, resulting in shorter limbs and a larger head. Therefore, it is more plausible that most dwarfism patients have achondroplasia rather than an increase in pathogenic microorganisms."}}
{"Q": "John was not armed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He picked up a stick. (B) He died.", "R": {"text": "Answer: He picked up a stick.\nExplanation: Since John was not armed, he may have felt the need to defend himself and picked up a stick as a makeshift weapon. This is a more plausible answer than him dying simply because he was unarmed."}}
{"Q": "Plasmodium vivax malaria of one of them was passed to the other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Host switch occurred between the two patients. (B) Role switch occurred between the two patients.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Host switch occurred between the two patients.\nExplanation: Plasmodium vivax is a species of malaria that is transmitted through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. It cannot be transmitted directly from one person to another. Therefore, the only plausible explanation for one patient passing the infection to another is that a host switch occurred, meaning that the mosquito that initially infected one patient went on to bite the other patient, transmitting the infection. A role switch, on the other hand, refers to a change in the behavior or function of an organism, which is not applicable in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "The criminal repeated his previous crime. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This is a case of recidivism. (B) ADIS's doctor says ADIS's brain always unabated thinking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. This is a case of recidivism.\nExplanation: Recidivism refers to the tendency of a criminal to repeat their criminal behavior. It is a common phenomenon in the criminal justice system. In this case, the criminal repeated his previous crime, which suggests that he has a tendency to engage in criminal behavior. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that this is a case of recidivism. Option B, which suggests that the criminal has a medical condition that causes him to engage in criminal behavior, is less likely without further evidence or diagnosis."}}
{"Q": "In an orchard, a photographer prepares to take a picture of papaya flowers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The grower tells the photographer to come back when the papayas are about one meter tall. (B) She thinks my health condition is not very good.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The grower tells the photographer to come back when the papayas are about one meter tall.\nExplanation: Since the photographer is preparing to take a picture of papaya flowers, it is likely that the papaya trees are not yet fully grown. The grower's suggestion to come back when the papayas are about one meter tall indicates that the trees are not yet at the right stage for photographing the flowers. This is a plausible answer based on the information given in the question. Option B is not related to the situation and seems irrelevant."}}
{"Q": "Jack is an agronomist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has separated many amino acids. (B) He studies the particular plant science concerning crop production.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: An agronomist is a scientist who studies the particular plant science concerning crop production, including soil management, crop rotation, and plant breeding. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack studies crop production rather than separating amino acids."}}
{"Q": "Many biologist went there for their rarity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He saw a native plant in the desert. (B) It is said that brachiopods appeared in that forest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The presence of rare brachiopods in the forest would be a more plausible reason for biologists to visit than simply seeing a native plant in the desert. Brachiopods are a unique and interesting group of animals that are not commonly found in many ecosystems, so their appearance in a particular forest would be a significant draw for biologists."}}
{"Q": "She bought some meat as fodder. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary drank some black tea. (B) She keeps some ringtails.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She keeps some ringtails.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary bought meat as fodder for her ringtails, which are carnivorous animals, rather than her buying meat because she drank black tea."}}
{"Q": "John bought some kits. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their total weight is 100 ounces. (B) They are planted in the backyard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Their total weight is 100 ounces.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to John's purchase of kits. The fact that their total weight is 100 ounces gives us information about the quantity or size of the kits, which is relevant to the purchase. On the other hand, option B about planting them in the backyard seems unrelated and does not provide any useful information about the kits."}}
{"Q": "The protein expression will not be regulated in this case. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Poison damages protein by destroying the peptides. (B) Poison is conducive to the peptides in protein.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If the poison damages the protein by destroying the peptides, then the protein expression will not be regulated because the peptides are necessary for proper protein function and regulation. If the poison is conducive to the peptides in protein, it may enhance or alter protein expression, but it would still be regulated in some way. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My father told me it was a pupae. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike sat on the ground. (B) I didn't know what the small brown capsule was.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that the speaker didn't know what the small brown capsule was suggests that they were observing something new or unfamiliar. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of their confusion was not related to Mike sitting on the ground, but rather their lack of knowledge about the object in question. Additionally, the term \"pupae\" suggests that the object was likely an insect in its cocoon stage, which further supports the idea that the cause of confusion was related to unfamiliarity with the object rather than external factors like someone sitting on the ground."}}
{"Q": "We can see many stripes on their backs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kudus are African animals. (B) Fans hit the laser on the face of the star.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The stripes on their backs are a characteristic feature of kudus, which are African antelopes. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is unrelated and does not provide a logical explanation for the stripes on the kudus' backs."}}
{"Q": "The blanket was dirty. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He cleaned the surfaces. (B) He cleaned the inside of the blanket.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He cleaned the inside of the blanket.\nExplanation: If the blanket was dirty, it would make more sense to clean the inside of the blanket where the dirt and stains are likely to be. Cleaning the surfaces would not necessarily address the issue of a dirty blanket."}}
{"Q": "The plankton bloom all died of the pollution. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The manta was hungry. (B) Now we are confronted with the energy crisis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The manta was hungry.\nExplanation: Plankton is a primary food source for many marine animals, including the manta ray. If the plankton bloom died due to pollution, it would result in a lack of food for the manta and other marine animals, leading to hunger and potentially even death. Choice B, about the energy crisis, is not directly related to the death of the plankton bloom and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It was destroyed by large amounts of electrical energy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plane was hit in thunderclouds. (B) This car was bombed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The plane was hit in thunderclouds.\nExplanation: Thunderclouds are known to contain large amounts of electrical energy, and planes flying through them can be struck by lightning, which can cause significant damage or even destruction. On the other hand, it is less likely for a car to be destroyed by large amounts of electrical energy unless it was struck by lightning or involved in an electrical accident. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He can walk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is four-month years old. (B) Tom eats some health products containing enzymes every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Tom eats health products containing enzymes every day is a more plausible cause for his ability to walk than his age of four months. Age alone does not determine a person's ability to walk, but proper nutrition and physical development do play a significant role. Enzymes help break down food and aid in digestion, which can lead to better absorption of nutrients and overall health. Therefore, it is more likely that Tom's ability to walk is due to his healthy diet rather than his age."}}
{"Q": "I try to watch his behaviours. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My dog was biting clippings. (B) I want judge her boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My dog was biting clippings.\nExplanation: The statement mentions watching \"his behaviours,\" which implies that the subject being observed is male. Additionally, the mention of a dog biting clippings suggests that the speaker is monitoring the dog's actions, rather than trying to judge someone else's boyfriend. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The metal was conducting electricity. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It ran to other's areas. (B) The electrons tiny charged particles inside atoms carried the electricity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The electrons tiny charged particles inside atoms carried the electricity.\nExplanation: When a metal conducts electricity, it means that the electrons in the metal are able to move freely and carry the electric charge. This is because metals have a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons that are not bound to any particular atom and can move throughout the material. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A is not correct because electricity does not \"run\" to other areas, but rather flows through a conductor."}}
{"Q": "Cannibalism seems to have been acceptable in the earliest times. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Prevalent phenomena are usually acceptable at that time. (B) Twenty years have passed since the massacre.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: In the earliest times, humans were still evolving and developing their moral codes and societal norms. Cannibalism may have been prevalent due to factors such as food scarcity or cultural practices, and therefore was deemed acceptable at the time. As societies developed and evolved, cannibalism became less acceptable and was eventually outlawed in most cultures."}}
{"Q": "Vegetarian don't eat meat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Hares wont eat meat. (B) It is harder for them to resist the warmth in winter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Hares won't eat meat.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the fact that vegetarians don't eat meat. Hares are herbivores and do not eat meat, so it makes sense that they would not be affected by this dietary restriction. On the other hand, the second choice about resisting warmth in winter seems unrelated to the fact that vegetarians don't eat meat."}}
{"Q": "Many birds are flying to south these days. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Humans produce lots of halons today. (B) Winter is coming.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Winter is coming.\nExplanation: Many bird species migrate to warmer regions during the winter months to avoid the harsh weather conditions and lack of food in their breeding grounds. This behavior is a natural adaptation to survive in changing environments. The migration of birds is not related to the production of halons by humans, which are chemicals used in fire extinguishers and other applications. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mapel only sees a lot of light spots. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The teacher asked students to list some kinds of large antelopes. (B) Mapel looked at the stars through a telescope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Mapel only sees a lot of light spots, it is more likely that he looked at the stars through a telescope. Looking at the stars through a telescope can cause the appearance of many light spots due to the magnification of the stars and other celestial bodies. On the other hand, the teacher asking students to list some kinds of large antelopes is not related to the appearance of light spots."}}
{"Q": "He found that it consists of many living parenchymatous cells. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The researcher analyzed the nucellus into details. (B) John discovered some chondrites.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The researcher analyzed the nucellus into details.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the researcher found that the structure consists of many living parenchymatous cells. This suggests that the researcher conducted a detailed analysis of the nucellus, which is the tissue within the ovule of a flowering plant that surrounds and nourishes the developing embryo. Option B, which mentions the discovery of chondrites, is unrelated to the given sentence and therefore cannot be the cause of the finding."}}
{"Q": "The growth of Myceliums should be promised in Tom's experiment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have done a lot of experiments. (B) Tom put the microorganism in suitable substrate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tom promised the growth of Myceliums in his experiment by putting the microorganism in a suitable substrate. This means that he provided the necessary conditions for the Myceliums to grow, such as the right temperature, pH, and nutrients. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B. Choice A is not relevant to the question and does not explain what happened as a result of Tom's experiment."}}
{"Q": "It was almosted destroyed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A traveler found a piece of yellow quartz. (B) The natural habitat was exploited a lot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The natural habitat was exploited a lot.\nExplanation: Exploitation of natural habitat can lead to destruction of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity. This is a more plausible cause for destruction compared to a traveler finding a piece of yellow quartz."}}
{"Q": "She finds some hepaticas in the fields. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mother-in-law wants to plant some plants. (B) Luna wants to take pictures of some flowers in early spring.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Luna wants to take pictures of some flowers in early spring suggests that she is actively looking for flowers to photograph. Hepaticas are one of the first flowers to bloom in early spring, so it is likely that Luna found them while searching for photo opportunities. On the other hand, there is no indication that the mother-in-law wants to plant hepaticas specifically, making option A less likely."}}
{"Q": "The government encourages students to learn knowledge. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The teacher asks parents to provide books to their children. (B) Only in this way can students make an impact in the future.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If the government encourages students to learn knowledge, it is more likely that the teacher will ask parents to provide books to their children as a way to support their learning. This is a practical and feasible solution that can help students gain access to more resources and improve their education. Option B is not a direct consequence of the government's encouragement and is too vague to be a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His parents told him not to be afraid of ravens. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The clinical manifestations of wilson disease mainly are dyskinesia such as limb tremor, bradykinesia, gait instability and lmental symptoms such as lethargy, mental behavior changes. (B) The child described big black birds in his dream.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of his parents telling him not to be afraid of ravens is most likely related to the child's dream about big black birds, which may have included ravens. It is unlikely that the clinical manifestations of Wilson disease would be relevant to this situation."}}
{"Q": "She went to buy beets in the supermarket. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor told the pregnant woman to have food with high folic acid. (B) His mother asked him to buy a green vegetable.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The doctor told the pregnant woman to have food with high folic acid.\nExplanation: Beets are a good source of folic acid, which is important for pregnant women to consume for the healthy development of the fetus. Therefore, it is more plausible that the woman went to buy beets because her doctor advised her to do so, rather than because someone asked her to buy a green vegetable."}}
{"Q": "He was interest in painting. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His favorite was the painting patterns. (B) He was experienced with painting.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He was experienced with painting.\nExplanation: The sentence states that he was interested in painting, which implies that he had some level of involvement or experience with it. Option A, which suggests that his favorite aspect of painting was the patterns, does not necessarily follow logically from the given information. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There are many areas in our country. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They require development. (B) We can identify the, through their different characteristics.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They require development.\nExplanation: The statement implies that there are many areas in our country, which suggests that some of these areas may be underdeveloped or in need of further development. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it acknowledges the need for development in these areas. Option B may also be true, but it is not directly related to the statement and does not address the issue of development."}}
{"Q": "The prospect of the harvest looks bleak. . What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The annual precipitation of this region is up to 800 to 1200 mm. (B) There is no precipitation in this region. .", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There is no precipitation in this region.\nExplanation: If there is no precipitation in the region, then there would be no water for the crops to grow, leading to a poor harvest. Option (A) states that the annual precipitation is between 800 to 1200 mm, which is a significant amount of rainfall and would not lead to a bleak harvest. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes to eat tasteful fruit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom eats apples. (B) Tom often buys avocados.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom often buys avocados.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Tom likes to eat tasteful fruit, which implies that he has a preference for fruits that are flavorful and enjoyable to eat. While apples are a common fruit, the statement does not necessarily suggest that Tom exclusively eats apples. On the other hand, avocados are known for their rich and creamy taste, which could be considered tasteful. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom often buys avocados as a result of his preference for tasteful fruit."}}
{"Q": "He is the deputy of the CEO. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He builds frames. (B) He is responsible for the security of CEO.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: As the deputy of the CEO, it is more likely that he would be responsible for the security of the CEO rather than building frames. Building frames does not seem to be related to his role as the deputy of the CEO."}}
{"Q": "Scientists found that nocturnal insets and the flowers themsleves do great help. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wang is an expert of mechanics. (B) Scientists are studying pollination of flowers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The question mentions scientists studying the relationship between nocturnal insects and flowers, indicating that the topic being discussed is the pollination of flowers. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) is unrelated to the topic and does not provide any explanation for the cause of the relationship between nocturnal insects and flowers."}}
{"Q": "His stomach mucosa was damaged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom ate a lot of spicy food. (B) The man had contact with the source of Psittacosis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The damage to the stomach mucosa is more likely to be caused by Psittacosis, a bacterial infection that can damage the lining of the stomach, rather than spicy food. While spicy food can cause discomfort and irritation in the stomach, it is unlikely to cause significant damage to the mucosa. Psittacosis, on the other hand, is known to cause gastrointestinal symptoms and can lead to inflammation and damage to the stomach lining."}}
{"Q": "The student majored in medicine had to choose a ressearch interest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He worked in the department of medicine. (B) He chose Psychiatry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He chose Psychiatry.\nExplanation: Since the student majored in medicine, it is likely that they would choose a research interest within the field of medicine. Psychiatry is a subfield of medicine that deals with mental health, making it a plausible choice for the student's research interest. Option A is not a likely outcome as it is too broad and does not specifically relate to the student's research interest."}}
{"Q": "My father is an acrobat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He tried to make my body highly stiff. (B) He tried to make my body highly plastic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He tried to make my body highly plastic.\nExplanation: Acrobatics requires flexibility and agility, so it is more plausible that the father would try to make his child's body highly plastic (flexible) rather than highly stiff. Stiffness would hinder the child's ability to perform acrobatic moves."}}
{"Q": "Capitalism had a rapid development in this country. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Two hundred people died. (B) Many factories which concentrated on production sprung up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Many factories which concentrated on production sprung up.\nExplanation: As capitalism developed in a country, it led to the growth of industries and businesses. This resulted in the establishment of many factories that focused on production, leading to an increase in employment opportunities and economic growth. While there may have been some negative consequences of rapid industrialization, such as poor working conditions and environmental degradation, it is unlikely that the development of capitalism would directly result in the death of two hundred people."}}
{"Q": "There was a quake in the city. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many women died at that time. (B) The instrument detected the wave.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The instrument detected the wave.\nExplanation: When there is an earthquake, seismometers or other instruments detect the seismic waves that are generated by the movement of the earth's crust. These instruments are designed to measure the intensity and duration of the waves, and provide information about the location and magnitude of the earthquake. While earthquakes can be destructive and cause damage to buildings and infrastructure, it is unlikely that many women died as a result of the quake without further context or information."}}
{"Q": "I saw the baby guppies come out and swim away. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I observed the whole process of guppies giving birth. (B) I watched guppies eat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The observation of baby guppies being born and swimming away suggests that the person witnessed the process of guppies giving birth. Option B, watching guppies eat, does not provide a plausible explanation for the observed behavior of the baby guppies."}}
{"Q": "The source of the toxins were exposed to a large amount of heat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They got poisoned. (B) It emited a lot highly toxic fumes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It emitted a lot of highly toxic fumes.\nExplanation: When toxins are exposed to high heat, they can break down and release toxic fumes into the air. This can be dangerous for anyone nearby who inhales the fumes. It is important to handle toxins carefully and avoid exposing them to heat or other sources of potential danger."}}
{"Q": "She is able to move body joints through a full range of motion. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Linda has suffered from constipation for a week. (B) Mary's body is very flexibel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Mary's body is very flexible.\nExplanation: Flexibility is the ability of the body to move joints through a full range of motion. Option (A) about constipation has no relation to joint mobility. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He hydrolyzed collagen by boiling skin ligaments tendons etc. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted to get some gelatine. (B) Tom is lack of platelets.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Boiling skin, ligaments, tendons, etc. is a common method of extracting gelatine from collagen. Gelatine is a common ingredient in many food products, such as desserts, candies, and marshmallows. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom wanted to extract gelatine from collagen rather than being lack of platelets."}}
{"Q": "There are water drops on the inner wall of the bag after the banana is ripe. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bananas help gastrointestinal motility. (B) Tom puts the bananas in the bag to ripen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The water drops on the inner wall of the bag are most likely due to condensation. When Tom puts the bananas in the bag to ripen, the ethylene gas produced by the bananas can cause moisture to accumulate inside the bag, leading to condensation on the walls. Option A, which suggests that bananas help gastrointestinal motility, is not related to the presence of water drops on the bag."}}
{"Q": "Air saturation builds up. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The night in the fall becomes longer. (B) The resistivity increases gradually.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When air saturation builds up, it means that the air is holding more moisture than it can normally hold. This can lead to an increase in humidity, which in turn can cause the resistivity of materials to increase gradually. This is because moisture in the air can create a conductive path for electricity, which can interfere with the flow of current through materials. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not related to air saturation and is not a logical consequence of it."}}
{"Q": "From its body can be seen the prosperity of the Song Dynasty. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) That piece of blue and white porcelain is fake. (B) That piece of blue and white porcelain dates from the Song Dynasty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) That piece of blue and white porcelain dates from the Song Dynasty.\nExplanation: Blue and white porcelain was a significant product of the Song Dynasty, and it was highly valued and exported to other countries. The prosperity of the Song Dynasty was largely due to its advanced technology, including the development of porcelain production techniques. Therefore, it is more plausible that the piece of blue and white porcelain is authentic and from the Song Dynasty, rather than being fake."}}
{"Q": "The developing bud lost its protection. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Snowflakes fell down in the humid weather. (B) Seapals were ruptured by naughty kids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Snowflakes falling down in humid weather can cause the developing bud to lose its protection as the weight of the snow can damage the protective structures around the bud. On the other hand, seapals being ruptured by naughty kids seems less plausible as it is unlikely that children would be playing with seapals and even if they were, it is unlikely that they would cause enough damage to expose a developing bud."}}
{"Q": "He found warthogs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At night Tom explored the subterranean burrows often excavated by aardvarks. (B) Tom wants to make Ales by his own.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it suggests that Tom was exploring the subterranean burrows often excavated by aardvarks, which is a known habitat for warthogs. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the finding of warthogs and does not provide a logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "Ensuring their nutrition is critical. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sheep still need to be outdoors in winter. (B) Some cuckoos are foraging for food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Sheep still need to be outdoors in winter.\nExplanation: Sheep are livestock animals that require proper nutrition to maintain their health and well-being. In winter, when the weather is harsh and food sources are limited, it becomes even more critical to ensure that they have access to adequate nutrition. Therefore, it is important to make sure that they are still able to graze outdoors or are provided with sufficient feed and supplements to meet their nutritional needs. On the other hand, option B about cuckoos foraging for food is not related to the nutrition of sheep."}}
{"Q": "Bob read some related publications. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He learned more details. (B) He got some overviews.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He learned more details.\nExplanation: Reading related publications would likely provide Bob with more in-depth information and specific details about the topic he was reading about. While he may also have gained some overviews, the primary benefit of reading related publications would be to increase his knowledge and understanding of the subject matter."}}
{"Q": "He studied at what are quills made of. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At last he knew they were made of modified hairs with a coat of keratin. (B) At last he knew they were made of silk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) At last he knew they were made of modified hairs with a coat of keratin.\nExplanation: Quills are typically made from the modified hairs of porcupines, hedgehogs, or other animals. These hairs have a hard, protective coating of keratin, which is the same material that makes up human hair and nails. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person studying quills would discover that they are made of modified hairs with a coat of keratin, rather than silk, which is not commonly used in the production of quills."}}
{"Q": "The Smiths live in Amazon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The elderly in the family are all over 90 years old. (B) They've had problems.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement about the Smiths living in Amazon does not provide any information about the age of the elderly in the family. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer. However, living in Amazon can present various challenges and problems such as adapting to the climate, dealing with wildlife, and accessing basic necessities. Hence, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom discovers that cubs live in different areas of the zoo depending on their genders. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has been studying animal living habits recently. (B) Tom visited the zoo.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom discovered this information by visiting the zoo and observing the different areas where male and female cubs were kept, rather than studying animal living habits."}}
{"Q": "Juices are not as good as fruits. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I hate vegetables. (B) Squeezing the juice out of the fruit diminishes the nutritions inside.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Squeezing the juice out of the fruit diminishes the nutritions inside. When fruits are juiced, the process removes the fiber and some of the nutrients that are found in the whole fruit. Additionally, many store-bought juices contain added sugars and preservatives, which can further diminish their nutritional value. Therefore, it is generally better to consume whole fruits rather than just their juices."}}
{"Q": "After World War II, global governance has changed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After the Second World War, the population's standard of living and reactions changed. (B) Due to the Second World War, we need to change the way of governence.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The Second World War caused significant destruction and loss of life, leading to the realization that the existing system of governance was inadequate to prevent such catastrophic events. This led to the creation of international organizations such as the United Nations and the establishment of new norms and principles of international law to promote peace and prevent future conflicts. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He substituted linseed oil for soybean oil. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is very careful about eating healthy. (B) The researcher needed a kind of addition compound.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions a researcher, which suggests that the substitution was made for a specific scientific purpose rather than personal health reasons. Additionally, the mention of an addition compound further supports the idea that this was a deliberate choice made for a specific experiment or study."}}
{"Q": "She likes their turquoise plumage especially. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy keeps a jackdaw at home. (B) Mary likes motmots very much.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"their\" turquoise plumage, indicating that Mary likes a specific type of bird with turquoise plumage. The only option that mentions a bird is option B, which states that Mary likes motmots very much. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The old man wanted to keep healthy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The old man ate food that can purify his body. (B) His mom supervised him to exercise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the old man wanted to keep healthy, which implies that he took some actions to achieve this goal. Option A, which states that he ate food that can purify his body, is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to maintaining good health. Option B, which suggests that his mom supervised him to exercise, is not necessarily a plausible answer as it is not mentioned in the statement whether the old man's mother was present or involved in his efforts to stay healthy."}}
{"Q": "I planted dogwoods in my garden. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It thrived without competing with other various plants. (B) It thrived without being overwhelmed by other various plants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It thrived without being overwhelmed by other various plants.\nExplanation: Dogwoods are understory trees that prefer partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. If they were planted in a garden with other various plants that compete for resources, such as sunlight, water, and nutrients, they may not have thrived as well. However, if they were planted in an area where they were not overwhelmed by other plants, they would have had a better chance of thriving."}}
{"Q": "I think lotions are better. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I want to lose weight and keep in good health at the same time. (B) I once used ointments.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement \"I think lotions are better\" suggests that the person has had experience using both lotions and ointments. Therefore, option (B) - \"I once used ointments\" - is a more plausible cause for their preference. Option (A) is not relevant to the statement about lotions and ointments."}}
{"Q": "Attendants who are familiar with safety instructions are needed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Some cargos need to be unloaded from the freighters. (B) Customers should be informed of safety instructions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions the need for attendants who are familiar with safety instructions, which suggests that there are customers who need to be informed of these instructions. Option A, which mentions unloading cargos, does not relate to the need for attendants with safety knowledge. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She could live her natural life span. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Maxon officially became a gymnast. (B) The poor lady became our queen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The poor lady became our queen.\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer as becoming a queen would provide her with access to better healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions, which would increase her chances of living a longer life. On the other hand, Maxon becoming a gymnast would not have any direct impact on the lady's life span."}}
{"Q": "Experts worry that the environmental protection policy on petroleum use will be aborted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The aquarium needs to create a natural landscape for the animals so that they can better adapt to the environment of the aquarium. (B) People have long been inseparable from petrochemicals such as plastics.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The use of petroleum and petrochemicals is deeply ingrained in modern society, and many industries rely heavily on these resources. As a result, there may be resistance to policies that limit or regulate their use, which could lead to the potential abandonment of environmental protection policies related to petroleum use. On the other hand, the creation of a natural landscape in an aquarium, as mentioned in choice A, is not directly related to the issue of environmental protection policies on petroleum use."}}
{"Q": "My phone is fully charged. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I can make calls now. (B) The phone can be used without electricity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: When a phone is fully charged, it means that the battery has reached its maximum capacity and can now power the phone for a certain amount of time. This allows the user to make calls, use apps, and perform other functions without the need for a power source. Option B is not a plausible answer as all phones require electricity to function, even when fully charged."}}
{"Q": "Teeth show one of their characteristics. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rodents have special teeth. (B) Humans are vertebrates.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Teeth are a characteristic of vertebrates, which includes humans. While rodents do have special teeth, this is not the cause of teeth being a characteristic of all vertebrates."}}
{"Q": "John saw the criminal's face and told the police. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The police got the criminal. (B) The police got John.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The police got the criminal.\nExplanation: Since John saw the criminal's face and reported it to the police, it is likely that the police were able to use this information to identify and apprehend the criminal. It is unlikely that John would be arrested for reporting a crime to the police. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom has many kinds of waterfowl in his farm. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His hatchery can produce hundreds of millions of fertilized eggs every year. (B) Tom needs to prepare a variety of different feeds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Since Tom has many kinds of waterfowl in his farm, he needs to prepare a variety of different feeds to meet the specific dietary needs of each species. While it is possible that his hatchery can produce a large number of fertilized eggs, the statement does not necessarily follow from the fact that he has many kinds of waterfowl. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was forced by the landlord to do something. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is a relative to the landlord. (B) He is a slave to the landlord's family.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that he was forced to do something because he is a slave to the landlord's family. In many historical contexts, landlords had the power to force their slaves to do various tasks, and it was not uncommon for slaves to be mistreated or abused by their owners. Being a relative to the landlord does not necessarily imply that he would be forced to do something against his will."}}
{"Q": "He no longer has the ownership interest of the business enterprise. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My husband owes a lot debts. (B) The boss made over all his equity in the company.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the person no longer has ownership interest in the business enterprise, which means that he has given up his equity in the company. Option B is a more plausible answer as it directly addresses the cause of the loss of ownership interest. Option A is not a likely cause as it does not explain why the ownership interest was lost."}}
{"Q": "There are a lot of carbon dioxide around it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plastic was decompsed. (B) This village is beside a estuary.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This village is beside a estuary.\nExplanation: Estuaries are known to have high levels of carbon dioxide due to the decomposition of organic matter in the water. This could be the reason for the high levels of carbon dioxide around the village. On the other hand, plastic does not decompose easily and would not release carbon dioxide in significant amounts. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mary wants to have a localized massage on her hands. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor tells her to do acupressure. (B) Mary explained that she was explaining causes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The doctor tells her to do acupressure.\nExplanation: Since Mary wants a localized massage on her hands, the doctor may suggest acupressure as it involves applying pressure to specific points on the hands to relieve tension and pain. Option B does not make sense in this context as Mary explaining causes is not related to her request for a localized hand massage."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said she had an aging placenta. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The examination data showed severe calcification. (B) The duck was sick.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The examination data showed severe calcification.\nExplanation: Severe calcification is a common cause of an aging placenta. As the placenta ages, it becomes less efficient at delivering nutrients and oxygen to the fetus, which can lead to complications during pregnancy and delivery. A sick duck would not be a plausible cause for an aging placenta in a human pregnancy."}}
{"Q": "The government considers different environmental consequences. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The government wants to make new laws to protect the wild life. (B) The citizens hope the government can build more ways.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The government wants to make new laws to protect the wild life.\nExplanation: Considering environmental consequences is often a part of creating new laws and regulations to protect the environment and wildlife. It is unlikely that citizens would specifically request the government to consider environmental consequences in order to build more ways."}}
{"Q": "I saw swift shadows. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Peregrines passed my sight. (B) I jumped on the trampoline.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Peregrines passed my sight.\nExplanation: Swift shadows are often associated with birds of prey, such as peregrine falcons, as they fly quickly and cast shadows on the ground. Jumping on a trampoline would not typically cause swift shadows. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He picked up a lot of seashells. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has swum in the sea. (B) Tom wants to collect some remains of marine invertebrates.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom has swum in the sea.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom picked up seashells suggests that he has been near the sea. It is more likely that he picked up seashells as a souvenir or for decoration rather than collecting remains of marine invertebrates. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It ordered raw meat from the farm of cattles. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This hamburger restaurant ran out of meat. (B) The supplier has a lot raw meat to process.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the hamburger restaurant ran out of meat and needed to order more from the farm. If the supplier had a lot of raw meat to process, they would not necessarily need to specifically order from a farm of cattles. Additionally, the fact that they ordered raw meat specifically from a farm of cattles suggests that they were looking for a specific type of meat, rather than just any raw meat available."}}
{"Q": "She saw that most stags are dark brown with a prick on their neck. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa went to the zoo and saw the stag. (B) After eating too much food, she had a stomache.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lisa went to the zoo and saw the stag.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Lisa saw most stags are dark brown with a prick on their neck. This suggests that Lisa observed the stags in their natural habitat or at a place where they are commonly found, such as a zoo. Option B, which talks about Lisa having a stomach ache, is not related to the observation of stags and is therefore an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He is addicted to alcohol. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can't control his life. (B) He may die of alcohol poisoning.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Alcohol addiction can lead to a variety of negative consequences, including physical health problems such as liver damage and alcohol poisoning. While it is true that addiction can also lead to a loss of control over one's life, the immediate danger of alcohol poisoning makes option B a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He earned a lot of mony this season compared with last one. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He made a profit of three yuan. (B) His profit increased a lot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His profit increased a lot.\nExplanation: Since the statement mentions that he earned a lot of money compared to the previous season, it is more plausible that his profit increased significantly rather than just making a profit of three yuan."}}
{"Q": "The bomb on the left exploded. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Deflation occurs. (B) The bomb next to it exploded too.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The bomb next to it exploded too.\nExplanation: If the bomb on the left exploded, it is likely that it was part of a larger set of bombs or explosives. Therefore, it is plausible that the bomb next to it also exploded as a result of the initial explosion. Deflation occurring as a result of a bomb exploding does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The doctor told William that his eyesight was gradually losing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor used radiotherapy to treat William. (B) The doctor said he might lose his sight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The doctor said he might lose his sight.\nExplanation: The doctor's statement indicates that William's eyesight is deteriorating and there is a possibility of complete loss of vision. Radiotherapy is not a common treatment for gradual loss of eyesight, so option (A) is unlikely. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor takes a blood test on her. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Courtney feels that she has a high level of carbon dioxide. (B) Courtney feels that she suffers from anemia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that Courtney feels that she suffers from anemia, as this is a common reason for a doctor to take a blood test. Anemia is a condition where there is a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. A blood test can confirm whether or not someone has anemia and help determine the underlying cause. On the other hand, feeling like you have a high level of carbon dioxide would not typically be a reason for a blood test, as this can be measured through other means such as a breath test."}}
{"Q": "The ground was scattered with decaying fish. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The air is full of the stink of decayed fish. (B) Dolphins there often get sick.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The air is full of the stink of decayed fish.\nExplanation: When fish decay, they release a strong odor that can spread through the air. This can make the surrounding area unpleasant to be in and can potentially attract scavengers or predators. While it is possible that dolphins in the area could get sick from eating the decaying fish, there is no information in the sentence to support this as a more likely outcome than the strong odor."}}
{"Q": "They follow this rule in every mine areas. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their company has laid down a series of mining rules. (B) The bat wants to make friend with the mosquito.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Their company has laid down a series of mining rules.\nExplanation: It is common for mining companies to establish safety protocols and regulations to ensure the well-being of their workers and the environment. Following rules in mine areas is crucial to prevent accidents and maintain a safe working environment. Therefore, it is more plausible that the miners are following the rules set by their company rather than a bat wanting to make friends with a mosquito."}}
{"Q": "She bought various food containing proteins and so on. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The queen was hungry. (B) The lady hoped her poodle can have enough nutrients.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The lady hoped her poodle can have enough nutrients.\nExplanation: The mention of \"food containing proteins and so on\" suggests that the lady was concerned about providing her poodle with a balanced and nutritious diet. It is unlikely that the queen's hunger would be the cause of buying such specific types of food."}}
{"Q": "He didn't know which version to follow. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom seached for relevant laws. (B) This machine lost its operator.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom searched for relevant laws.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person in question is facing a decision or dilemma and is unsure which version to follow. The cause of this uncertainty is that he didn't know which version to follow, implying that there are multiple versions or options to choose from. Option A, which states that Tom searched for relevant laws, is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the person is trying to find guidance or clarity by researching the relevant laws or regulations. Option B, which suggests that a machine lost its operator, is not a likely cause for the person's dilemma as it is not related to the decision or choice he is facing."}}
{"Q": "Peter exposed a live circuit to a changing magnetic field. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The state of the wire changes. (B) The sunlight was reflected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The state of the wire changes.\nExplanation: When a live circuit is exposed to a changing magnetic field, it induces an electric current in the wire. This can cause the wire to heat up, change its shape, or even break. Therefore, the state of the wire changes as a result of the exposure to the changing magnetic field. Option B, that sunlight was reflected, is not related to the scenario described in the question."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to the school lab and finished the studies. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted to do some studies. (B) Tom wrote a study on epiphytes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Tom went to the school lab and finished the studies, but it does not mention anything about Tom writing a study on epiphytes. Therefore, option B is not a plausible answer. Option A, on the other hand, is a more likely cause as it suggests that Tom went to the lab with the intention of doing some studies."}}
{"Q": "Explosives dissolve easily in water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The problem of invagination needs to be solved. (B) It difficult for scientists to extract the explosive molecules of explosives.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If explosives dissolve easily in water, it would make it difficult for scientists to extract the explosive molecules from the water. This could potentially make it harder to dispose of explosives safely and could also pose a risk to the environment if the water containing the explosive molecules is not properly treated. The problem of invagination, which refers to the folding of a membrane into a pocket, is not related to the solubility of explosives in water."}}
{"Q": "Tom has suffered migraine for a long time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He felt dizzy yesterday. (B) He asked the doctor to gave him some depressants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Migraine is a neurological condition that causes severe headaches, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is unlikely that Tom's migraine would cause him to feel dizzy yesterday, as dizziness is not a common symptom of migraine. However, it is possible that Tom has been struggling to manage his migraine symptoms and has asked his doctor for medication to help alleviate the pain and discomfort. Depressants are not typically prescribed for migraine, but there are several medications that can be effective in treating this condition."}}
{"Q": "They saw meerkats in South Africa. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They were surprised by the cold weather. (B) They were surprised by its unique patterns.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Nothing specific happened as a result.\nExplanation: Simply seeing meerkats in South Africa would not necessarily result in any specific event or outcome such as being surprised by the weather or patterns. It would depend on the individual's reaction and experience, but there is no clear cause-and-effect relationship between seeing meerkats and a specific outcome."}}
{"Q": "His foot was uncomfortable. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wore two left boots in the morning. (B) Tom was jogging on a hazy road.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's foot was uncomfortable because he was jogging on a hazy road. Wearing two left boots would be an unlikely mistake, whereas jogging on a hazy road could cause discomfort due to uneven terrain or poor visibility."}}
{"Q": "He analysed the composition of the soil. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He discovered many different elements. (B) Stratification is formed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He discovered many different elements.\nExplanation: When someone analyses the composition of soil, they typically test for the presence of various elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. These elements are essential for plant growth and can affect the fertility of the soil. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person would discover many different elements rather than the formation of stratification, which is a geological process that occurs over a long period of time."}}
{"Q": "Overloading has caused serious consequences. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He directly make deals with clients. (B) There are rules for penalizing such consequences.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Overloading can lead to various consequences such as delays in project completion, decreased productivity, and compromised quality of work. To prevent such negative outcomes, there are rules and penalties in place to discourage overloading and ensure that work is distributed evenly among team members. Option A is not a plausible answer as it does not directly relate to the consequences of overloading."}}
{"Q": "He was elected as officals in his county. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike is a worker. (B) Mike is a sheriff.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that Mike is a sheriff, as being a sheriff is a position that would typically involve being elected as an official in a county. While being a worker could potentially lead to being elected to a county position, it is less likely and would depend on the specific type of work and qualifications of the individual."}}
{"Q": "These plots are full of wheat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has many adjacent plots. (B) Tom can't farm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom has many adjacent plots.\nExplanation: The fact that the plots are full of wheat suggests that they have been successfully farmed. Therefore, it is unlikely that Tom cannot farm. The more plausible explanation is that Tom has many adjacent plots, which he has used to grow wheat. This would allow him to maximize his farming output and potentially sell the wheat for profit."}}
{"Q": "The test showed that the deeper tissue has got the nourishment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wiped those nourishment on the tissue. (B) They analyzed the cartilage.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They analyzed the cartilage.\nExplanation: The test mentioned in the question is likely a scientific analysis of the tissue, which would involve analyzing the composition of the tissue, including the cartilage. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer as it suggests that the researchers analyzed the cartilage to determine that the deeper tissue had more nourishment. Option (A) is unlikely as wiping nourishment on the tissue would not provide a scientific analysis of the tissue's composition."}}
{"Q": "Larvaceans would handle more materials to make their houses more comfortable. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Larvaceans are growing every day. (B) Rebuilding the house is the only thing that larvaceans can do every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Larvaceans are filter-feeding animals that constantly pump water through their bodies to capture food particles. As they grow, they need to consume more food to sustain their metabolism and growth. This means they produce more waste and need to filter more water, which results in more debris accumulating in their houses. Therefore, larvaceans need to handle more materials to make their houses more comfortable as they grow and require more food. Option B is not a plausible answer as larvaceans do not need to rebuild their houses every day, but rather continuously add and remove materials to maintain their structure."}}
{"Q": "He is in debt now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom borrows money from his colleagues every day. (B) Tom borrowed a lot of money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer as it states that Tom borrowed a lot of money, which could have led to his current debt situation. Option A suggests that Tom borrows money every day, but it does not necessarily mean that he is in debt because of it."}}
{"Q": "Lucy recently has a diet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She usually eats Hamburgs. (B) She eats a lot of fruit instead of rice .", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Lucy recently started a diet, it is more plausible that she would change her eating habits and opt for healthier options such as fruits instead of rice. It is less likely that she would continue to eat hamburgers if she is trying to improve her diet."}}
{"Q": "His sensory organ developed very well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This boy was provided with enough toys in his childhood. (B) She had the symptom of apnea.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Providing a child with enough toys does not necessarily lead to the development of sensory organs. However, exposure to a variety of sensory experiences through play and exploration can contribute to the development of sensory organs. Therefore, it is more plausible that the boy's sensory organ developed well due to his exposure to a variety of sensory experiences during his childhood."}}
{"Q": "Trogons built their home in a cavities. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Trogons are good at finding cavities. (B) Trogons do not build nests.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Trogons are known for their ability to find and utilize natural cavities in trees for nesting. They do not build nests themselves, but instead rely on finding suitable cavities to use as their homes. This behavior has likely evolved as a way to protect their eggs and young from predators, as the enclosed space of a cavity provides a safe and secure environment."}}
{"Q": "They all just grow corn. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) These fields are very dry. (B) This field is all monoculture.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Monoculture refers to the practice of growing only one type of crop in a particular area. This can lead to a lack of biodiversity and can make crops more susceptible to disease and pests. In this case, the fact that all the fields are growing corn suggests that the farmers are practicing monoculture, which may be due to factors such as market demand or government subsidies for corn production."}}
{"Q": "They have different functions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A large number of small bees live in hives. (B) There are many paths in the park.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that a large number of small bees live in hives suggests that they have a social structure and division of labor, which could lead to different functions among the bees. On the other hand, the existence of many paths in a park does not necessarily have any direct correlation with the cause of different functions."}}
{"Q": "Tom's body is deficient in protein. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor advised him to eat more lean pork. (B) Tom likes eating bananas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: When the body is deficient in protein, the doctor would typically recommend increasing protein intake through sources such as lean meats, eggs, and dairy products. Bananas are not a significant source of protein, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "These membranes are permeable. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It can catch these waves more easily. (B) Exchanges can occur across them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If a membrane is permeable, it means that substances can pass through it. In this case, exchanges can occur across the membrane, allowing for the movement of molecules or ions between different compartments or environments. This is a common feature of biological membranes, which are selectively permeable to certain substances based on their size, charge, or other properties. The ability to exchange molecules or ions across a membrane is essential for many biological processes, such as nutrient uptake, waste removal, and cell signaling."}}
{"Q": "Every one in the audience region is weeping or crying. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Iron man is dying. (B) Tom's workers are on strike.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Iron man is dying.\nExplanation: Iron man is a beloved superhero character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If he were to die in a movie or TV show, it would likely elicit an emotional response from fans and viewers. On the other hand, Tom's workers being on strike may cause frustration or concern, but it is less likely to cause widespread weeping or crying in an audience region."}}
{"Q": "The doctor found the level of carbon dioxide was too high. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She had a blood routine examination. (B) The researcher inflated some carbon dioxide into the liquid.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because the presence of excess carbon dioxide in the body can be caused by inhaling too much of it or by the body's inability to properly eliminate it. Option A, having a blood routine examination, is unlikely to cause high levels of carbon dioxide in the body."}}
{"Q": "John wanted to raise a semi-hardy perennial. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He collect durable wood. (B) He raised buttercups.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He raised buttercups.\nExplanation: A semi-hardy perennial is a plant that can survive in colder temperatures but may need some protection during harsh winters. Buttercups are a type of semi-hardy perennial, so it would make sense for John to raise them if he wanted to grow a plant that could withstand colder temperatures. Collecting durable wood would not be relevant to raising a semi-hardy perennial."}}
{"Q": "A lady needed twigs to make an art work. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She took the scissors to cut the shrubs. (B) The lady's desire was aroused.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the lady took the scissors to cut the shrubs to obtain the twigs she needed for her art work. This is a logical and practical solution to her need for twigs. Option B, on the other hand, is vague and does not provide any clear explanation of what happened as a result of the lady's need for twigs."}}
{"Q": "John is looking in the mirror. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom can see Mary standing behind the mirror. (B) He found his eyes blue.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He found his eyes blue.\nExplanation: When John looks in the mirror, he sees his reflection and may notice something about himself, such as the color of his eyes. Choice (A) is not plausible as it suggests that someone else is behind the mirror, which is not possible."}}
{"Q": "He decided to buy some hemlocks. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The house owner wanted some trees inside his house. (B) Tom used a thermometer to mearsure his temperature.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The house owner wanted some trees inside his house.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"he\" decided to buy some hemlocks, but it does not specify who \"he\" is. However, the use of the word \"buy\" suggests that this person is making a purchase, which is more likely to be a homeowner than someone measuring their temperature with a thermometer. Additionally, the mention of \"hemlocks\" suggests that this person is looking for trees, which could be used for decoration or landscaping. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of this decision is that the house owner wanted some trees inside his house."}}
{"Q": "The house was on fire and the people needed water to put it out. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The water in it remained cool. (B) People came to the bay.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) People came to the bay.\nExplanation: It is logical that if people needed water to put out a fire, they would go to a nearby source of water, such as a bay or lake. Option (A) is irrelevant to the situation and does not make sense as the water would heat up when used to put out a fire. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was confused when he faced options. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He later suffered from neurosis. (B) He was confused about which career path to choose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When someone is faced with multiple options and is confused about which one to choose, it is common for them to feel overwhelmed and unsure. This can lead to indecision and anxiety, but it is unlikely to result in a diagnosis of neurosis. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a petrologist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom studies rocks as his analysis. (B) He can only sing in falsetto.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tom studies rocks as his analysis.\nExplanation: As a petrologist, Tom's area of expertise is the study of rocks, including their composition, structure, and formation. This profession does not have any correlation with his ability to sing in falsetto, making option B an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I turn to the technology of my colleges. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I have difficulty checking all the machines. (B) I need a yottabytes of memory.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the speaker is having difficulty checking all the machines, which implies that they are responsible for maintaining or monitoring multiple devices. Turning to the technology of their colleagues could mean seeking assistance or support from others who are more knowledgeable or experienced in this area. On the other hand, option B is unlikely as yottabytes of memory is an extremely large amount that is not typically required for regular tasks."}}
{"Q": "Beets dosen't grow well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather is hot throughout this year. (B) The water is hot throughout this year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The weather is hot throughout this year.\nExplanation: Beets prefer cooler temperatures and can struggle to grow in hot weather. High temperatures can cause the plants to bolt (produce flowers and seeds prematurely) and can also lead to poor root development. Therefore, it is more likely that the hot weather is the cause of the poor growth of beets. While water temperature can also affect plant growth, it is less likely to be the primary cause in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "The doctor diagnosed the spread of virus particles in the patient. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The patient was in a dangerous state. (B) The doctor found that there were on all epithelial surfaces.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The patient was in a dangerous state.\nExplanation: If the doctor diagnosed the spread of virus particles in the patient, it means that the virus has already spread throughout the body, which is a dangerous state for the patient. The spread of virus particles can lead to severe illness and even death, depending on the type of virus and the patient's immune system. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not necessarily a result of the diagnosis, but rather a possible observation made by the doctor during the diagnosis."}}
{"Q": "The worker was poisoned. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There is some waste. (B) The content of methanol in the new house overwhelmed the body's capacity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The content of methanol in the new house overwhelmed the body's capacity is a more plausible answer as methanol is a toxic substance that can cause poisoning if ingested or inhaled. It is commonly found in solvents, fuels, and antifreeze. If the worker was exposed to high levels of methanol in the new house, it could have overwhelmed their body's capacity to detoxify it, leading to poisoning. On the other hand, option A, there is some waste, is too vague and does not provide any specific information about the cause of poisoning."}}
{"Q": "He found some dysprosium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He explored the metal coating of halogen lamps. (B) Sam camped out in the woods at night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He explored the metal coating of halogen lamps.\nExplanation: Dysprosium is a rare earth element that is commonly used in the metal coating of halogen lamps. Therefore, it is more plausible that he found dysprosium while exploring the metal coating of halogen lamps rather than while camping out in the woods at night."}}
{"Q": "Tony wanted to buy some food. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought one hamburger in a McDonald's store. (B) The servers bring what he wants to eat in the restaurant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The question states that Tony wanted to buy some food, which implies that he was looking to make a purchase. Option A states that he bought one hamburger in a McDonald's store, which is a plausible outcome of someone wanting to buy food. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Tony was already in a restaurant and the servers brought him food, which does not necessarily align with the initial statement that he wanted to buy food. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He grew up and became a well-known jeweler. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom also has wrinkles at thirties. (B) He created a lot of fine jewelry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that becoming a well-known jeweler would result in creating a lot of fine jewelry, rather than suddenly developing wrinkles at a young age."}}
{"Q": "They have a strong desire to drink water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ticks is sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals. (B) Those men are hikers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that those men are hikers and have been exerting themselves, causing them to become thirsty and have a strong desire to drink water. Ticks being sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals is not relevant to the situation described."}}
{"Q": "Barometers are needed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We have to measure its responsiveness. (B) Air pressure should be measured.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Air pressure should be measured.\nExplanation: Barometers are instruments used to measure air pressure. This is important in weather forecasting, aviation, and other fields where changes in air pressure can have significant effects. Therefore, the need for barometers is primarily driven by the need to measure air pressure accurately. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not provide a clear reason for why barometers are needed."}}
{"Q": "A group of thiefs were caught. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They returned home. (B) They handed in the stolen things.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They handed in the stolen things.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the thieves would be required to return the stolen items as a form of punishment or restitution for their crime. Returning home would not be a suitable consequence for their actions."}}
{"Q": "He composted the soil. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He used it as a water container. (B) The pH of the soil gradually balances out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The pH of the soil gradually balances out.\nExplanation: Composting soil involves adding organic matter to it, which helps to improve its structure and fertility. As the organic matter breaks down, it releases nutrients into the soil and helps to balance its pH level. This makes the soil more suitable for growing plants and crops. Using composted soil as a water container (choice A) is not a common practice and would not be a likely result of composting soil."}}
{"Q": "It is normal, what it eats have enough water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My grasshopper did not drink the water I prepared. (B) Green tea is a typical catabolic food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Grasshoppers typically obtain their water from the food they eat, so if the grasshopper is eating food that already has enough water content, it may not need to drink the water provided by its owner. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B is not relevant to the question and does not provide a logical explanation for the grasshopper's behavior."}}
{"Q": "The machine has some functions similar to the human minds. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It can identify some obvious patterns. (B) All signal transduction pathways can fulfill that function.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the machine has some functions similar to the human mind, which implies that it has some level of cognitive ability. One of the basic cognitive abilities is pattern recognition, which allows humans to identify and categorize objects, events, and ideas based on their similarities and differences. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that the machine can also identify some obvious patterns, although it may not be as sophisticated as the human mind in this regard. On the other hand, choice B is unlikely to be true because signal transduction pathways are biochemical processes that transmit signals within cells, and they do not have cognitive functions."}}
{"Q": "The fuel compression was done. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom put carbon monoxide together with compounds. (B) Tom squeezed all the fuel with the machine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Fuel compression is the process of reducing the volume of fuel by applying pressure. This is typically done with a machine or engine. Choice B is the more plausible answer as it directly describes the process of fuel compression. Choice A, on the other hand, suggests that carbon monoxide was mixed with other compounds, which is not directly related to fuel compression."}}
{"Q": "John observes the way animals breathe. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She observed them carefully. (B) He saw the diaphragm contract as the rabbit inhaled.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that John observed the way animals breathe, and specifically mentions seeing the diaphragm contract as the rabbit inhaled. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the observation mentioned in the statement. Option A is too general and does not provide any specific information about what John observed."}}
{"Q": "My family called it toy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I bred this tiny dog as my pet. (B) I have witnessed their hospitality.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the family called the dog a toy because it was bred as a small pet, rather than witnessing their hospitality. The word \"toy\" is often used to describe small breeds of dogs that are kept as pets."}}
{"Q": "The prey got into its mouth. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The frogfish rushed to its prey. (B) The lizard met its prey.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The frogfish rushed to its prey.\nExplanation: Frogfish are known for their ability to rapidly expand their mouths to suck in prey. Therefore, it is more plausible that the frogfish rushed to its prey and used this technique to capture it, rather than a lizard meeting its prey."}}
{"Q": "His friend yelled tom stepped in Crevasses. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom and his friend went to the church last Sunday. (B) Tom stepped in narrow deep cracks in the glacier.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom stepped in narrow deep cracks in the glacier.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that Tom stepped in crevasses, which are narrow deep cracks in a glacier. Choice (A) about going to church is irrelevant and does not explain the cause of Tom stepping in crevasses. Therefore, choice (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The list shows that you used much water last month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They appear in summer and autumn. (B) I cleaned my whole house in and out during last month.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that the person used much water last month suggests that they were doing something that required a lot of water, such as cleaning their house inside and out. Choice A, which mentions the appearance of something in summer and autumn, is not related to the question and does not provide a plausible explanation for the high water usage."}}
{"Q": "It manages occurrence of data. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He organized the data into tables. (B) This special organization is in charge of tracking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the management of data occurrence is the responsibility of a specific organization or system. Therefore, option B, which states that this special organization is in charge of tracking, is a more plausible answer than option A, which only mentions organizing data into tables."}}
{"Q": "Synthetic resin smells toxic when burned. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's clothes made of polyester smell poisonous when burned. (B) The doctor suggested citizens to take some delarvirdines.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Synthetic resin is commonly used in the production of polyester, which is a type of synthetic fabric. When burned, polyester emits a toxic smell due to the chemicals used in its production. Therefore, it is plausible that Tom's clothes made of polyester would smell poisonous when burned. On the other hand, there is no connection between burning synthetic resin and the doctor suggesting citizens to take delarvirdines, which is a medication used to treat HIV."}}
{"Q": "Many insects are eaten by them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are many sparrows in the orchard. (B) Human beings need nutritious food for their survival.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Insects are a good source of nutrition for many animals, including humans. It is likely that the animals in question are eating insects because they need nutritious food for their survival. The presence of sparrows in the orchard may also contribute to the consumption of insects, but it is not the primary cause."}}
{"Q": "He was bit by wasps. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He studies plants. (B) He felt very painful.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If someone is bitten by wasps, it is likely that they will feel a lot of pain as a result. Studying plants is not a logical consequence of being bitten by wasps."}}
{"Q": "The baby bike could not bear his weight. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My baby became a teenager. (B) My baby became much thinner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the baby bike not being able to bear the baby's weight is most likely due to the baby becoming much thinner. As babies grow and develop, their weight can fluctuate, and if the baby has lost a significant amount of weight, the bike may no longer be able to support them. Option A, that the baby became a teenager, is not a plausible answer as it would take several years for the baby to grow into a teenager and the bike would have likely been replaced by then."}}
{"Q": "I found its interest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I had a hobby. (B) I had a budgie.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Having a hobby is a more plausible reason for developing an interest in something than simply having a pet bird. While a budgie may be enjoyable to have as a companion, it is unlikely to be the sole cause of a newfound interest. A hobby, on the other hand, involves actively engaging in an activity that one enjoys and can lead to a deeper appreciation and interest in that particular area."}}
{"Q": "Tom is an engineer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom designed different kinds of buildings. (B) He studies different kinds of structures.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom designed different kinds of buildings.\nExplanation: As an engineer, Tom's main job is to design and create structures such as buildings, bridges, and roads. While he may also study different kinds of structures, the most likely result of his profession is that he designs different kinds of buildings."}}
{"Q": "They are like living creatures. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Those dolls look exactly like people. (B) The clocks are moving all the time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions \"living creatures\" which implies that the dolls are resembling humans in a way that they appear to be alive. Therefore, option A, which states that \"those dolls look exactly like people\" is a more plausible answer. Option B, which talks about moving clocks, is not related to the statement and does not provide a logical explanation for the dolls appearing like living creatures."}}
{"Q": "He prevented it from harm of mealybugs with great efforts. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The gardener was hired to take care of my poinsettias. (B) He removed the ligaments.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The gardener was hired to take care of my poinsettias.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the gardener prevented harm from mealybugs, which suggests that the gardener was hired to take care of the poinsettias and took measures to protect them from pests. Option B, which suggests that ligaments were removed, is not relevant to the context and does not provide a plausible explanation for the gardener's actions."}}
{"Q": "It turned out to be dynamics. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom searched the Internet for the nature of loudness of an instrument. (B) Tommy's wheel was making a strange noise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tommy's wheel was making a strange noise.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that something unexpected happened, and the cause was dynamics. Option (A) about Tom searching the internet for the nature of loudness of an instrument seems unrelated to the situation. On the other hand, option (B) about Tommy's wheel making a strange noise is more plausible as it suggests a mechanical issue that could affect the dynamics of the situation."}}
{"Q": "The editor has left a special page for national news. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This staff is good at arranging pages to be printed on the press. (B) It is important for people to know important events of the country every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that the editor left a special page for national news suggests that they believe it is important for people to know about important events happening in the country on a daily basis. This is a common practice in news organizations as they strive to keep their audience informed about current events. Choice A may be true, but it does not directly explain why the editor left a special page for national news."}}
{"Q": "Tom was infected with pneumonia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The bacteria in his body became resistant to antibiotics. (B) Tom's family was worried about him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: When someone is infected with pneumonia, it is a serious illness that can cause difficulty breathing, fever, and other symptoms. It is likely that Tom's family would be worried about him and concerned for his health. While antibiotic resistance can be a concern with bacterial infections, it is not necessarily a direct result of someone being infected with pneumonia."}}
{"Q": "Tom fails the blood test. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has just had a wine. (B) Tom drew some blood to check his body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom has just had a wine.\nExplanation: Consuming alcohol before a blood test can affect the results, as it can increase the levels of certain enzymes and alter the composition of blood. Therefore, it is more likely that Tom's failure in the blood test was caused by his recent consumption of wine rather than him drawing blood to check his body."}}
{"Q": "They climbed up to the peak of the hill. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have made holes in a steep slope that used to be thickly vegetated. (B) They felt the climate much colder than that at the foot of the hill.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: When climbing up to the peak of a hill, the altitude increases and the temperature usually drops. This is due to the decrease in air pressure and the fact that the higher altitude is farther away from the warmth of the ground. Therefore, it is more plausible that they felt the climate much colder than that at the foot of the hill rather than making holes in a steep slope that used to be thickly vegetated."}}
{"Q": "Tattoos can keep its color for a long time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I benefied from long term hair removal. (B) Color in a relatively permanent skin layer like the dermis would not fade soon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tattoos are made by injecting ink into the dermis layer of the skin, which is relatively permanent compared to the outer layer of the skin. The ink particles are too large for the body's immune system to remove, so they remain in the dermis layer and keep their color for a long time. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A, long term hair removal, is not related to the color retention of tattoos."}}
{"Q": "Kate's doctor prescribed a drug containing zinc. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kate is ill and will be treated. (B) Kate is suffering from thermal hyperalgesia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Zinc is often prescribed to treat various illnesses, such as the common cold, pneumonia, and diarrhea. It is also used to boost the immune system and promote wound healing. Therefore, it is more plausible that Kate is ill and will be treated with the drug containing zinc. Thermal hyperalgesia, on the other hand, is a condition characterized by increased sensitivity to heat and is not typically treated with zinc."}}
{"Q": "Some of the leaves on Tom's potted plants are getting old and dying. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are mildew spots on some leaves. (B) Tom finds that the leaves has been eaten after a while.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: As leaves age and die, they become more susceptible to fungal infections such as mildew. This is a common occurrence in potted plants and can be a sign that the plant needs better air circulation or less moisture. Option B is less likely as leaves that have died naturally do not typically get eaten by pests."}}
{"Q": "Tom draws graphics by drawing pixels. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is from Brazil. (B) Tom wants to draw a digital image.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Drawing pixels is a common technique used in digital art and graphic design. It allows for precise control over the placement and color of individual pixels, which is necessary for creating high-quality digital images. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom draws graphics by drawing pixels because he wants to create a digital image rather than simply because he is from Brazil."}}
{"Q": "She can heal small animals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The witch had telekinesis. (B) She is a witch.", "R": {"text": "Answer: She is a witch.\nExplanation: In many fictional stories and legends, witches are often portrayed as having magical powers, including the ability to heal animals and humans. Therefore, it is more plausible that the witch's ability to heal small animals is due to her being a witch rather than having telekinesis."}}
{"Q": "Kur is using a microscope to observe the growth of pollen tubes from the surface of pollen grains. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kur named it germination. (B) He drew some alkanes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Kur named it germination.\nExplanation: Germination refers to the process of a seed or spore beginning to grow and develop into a new plant. In the case of pollen grains, the growth of pollen tubes from the surface of the grain is a crucial step in the fertilization process. Therefore, it is plausible that Kur would use the term germination to describe this process. Option B, drawing alkanes, is not relevant to the observation of pollen tube growth and is therefore an unlikely outcome."}}
{"Q": "Lucy didn't deliver a live baby. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy has suffered form infertility. (B) Lucy kept smoking while pregnant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Lucy has suffered from infertility.\nExplanation: Infertility is a medical condition that can prevent a woman from conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term. It is a more plausible explanation for Lucy not delivering a live baby than smoking during pregnancy, which can increase the risk of complications but is not always a direct cause of stillbirth or miscarriage. Additionally, smoking during pregnancy is a preventable risk factor, whereas infertility is not within a woman's control."}}
{"Q": "The visibility was lower. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There was a light rain in the polluted city. (B) The mountain is very humid due to frequent rains.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The presence of light rain in a polluted city can cause a decrease in visibility due to the combination of water droplets and pollutants in the air. Humidity in the mountains may also affect visibility, but it is less likely to be the main cause compared to pollution and rain."}}
{"Q": "The building is of low visibility in fog. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Harvesters have their hands protected during harvesting time. (B) It can only be seen to a low degree.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It can only be seen to a low degree.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the building has low visibility in fog, which means that it cannot be seen clearly. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (B) as it directly relates to the given information. Option (A) is unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "These adolescent boys haven't had any relationships yet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Masturbation never occurs. (B) Masturbation occurs frequently.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Masturbation occurs frequently.\nExplanation: It is a natural and common behavior for adolescents to explore their own bodies and experience sexual arousal through masturbation, regardless of whether they have had any relationships or not. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would engage in masturbation frequently rather than not at all."}}
{"Q": "Tom chooses kiwi to collect fructose. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Food was used to treat my disease. (B) Tom wants to collect fructose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The question clearly states that Tom chose kiwi to collect fructose, indicating that his intention was to collect fructose. Option A, which suggests that Tom used food to treat a disease, is not relevant to the question and does not explain why he chose kiwi specifically to collect fructose. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom goes to evergreen forest to find the bird. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to see a giraffe. (B) Tom wants to take photos of kinglets.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tom's goal is to take photos of kinglets, which are birds. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would go to a forest to find them rather than to see a giraffe, which is not typically found in a forest habitat."}}
{"Q": "Mother pointed out Bob's mistake and said that birds can't masticate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob told his mother that the bird was masticating happily. (B) Bob told his mother that birds can fly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The cause of Mother pointing out Bob's mistake was that Bob told his mother that the bird was masticating happily, which is not possible as birds do not have teeth and cannot chew their food."}}
{"Q": "He uses slits as devices. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wants to control noise. (B) Tom is polymerizing the modules.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The use of slits as devices is more likely to be for controlling noise rather than polymerizing modules. Slits can be used to reduce or eliminate unwanted sound waves by allowing only certain frequencies to pass through. This is a common technique used in acoustic engineering and is a plausible reason for why he would use slits as devices."}}
{"Q": "His mental development is slower than that of his peers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Peter had a serious illness when he was a baby. (B) Tom eats too much food containing lipids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Peter had a serious illness when he was a baby.\nExplanation: Serious illnesses during infancy can lead to developmental delays, including delays in mental development. Lipid consumption does not have a direct correlation with mental development."}}
{"Q": "Its is possible for text-to-speech process in different languages. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man invented speech resynthesis. (B) Cochlear implant is a common implant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Text-to-speech technology is based on the concept of speech resynthesis, which was invented by a man named Dennis Klatt in the 1980s. This technology involves analyzing the phonetic and acoustic properties of human speech and then using this information to synthesize speech from written text. As a result, it is possible to create text-to-speech systems in different languages by analyzing the phonetic and acoustic properties of each language and then using this information to synthesize speech in that language. Cochlear implants, on the other hand, are devices that are implanted in the ear to help people with hearing loss hear better, and are not directly related to text-to-speech technology."}}
{"Q": "The magezing is classified as pornographic magazine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom goes for a walk outside in the cold winter. (B) The magazine has pictures of naked girls.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The magazine being classified as pornographic is most likely due to the fact that it contains pictures of naked girls, which is a common characteristic of pornographic material. Going for a walk in the cold winter (choice A) has no relevance to the classification of the magazine."}}
{"Q": "Ability of chemically interacting with many other substances indicates chemical instability. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Phenols has chemical instability. (B) Acetylene is prone to undergo addition reaction with many substances.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that a substance that can chemically interact with many other substances is chemically unstable. Therefore, option B is more plausible as it states that acetylene is prone to undergo addition reactions with many substances, indicating its chemical instability. Option A, which states that phenols have chemical instability, is not necessarily true as phenols can be stable under certain conditions and do not necessarily react with many other substances."}}
{"Q": "The explorer wore crampons in climbing the snow mountain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He successfully climbed to the top of the mountain with the spikes on the soles. (B) The spike-soled boots helped him in climbing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Crampons are spikes that are attached to the soles of boots to provide better traction on snow and ice. Therefore, it is more plausible that the explorer successfully climbed to the top of the mountain with the spikes on the soles."}}
{"Q": "She tries different principles and solves them respectively. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary has to settle all the problems in these three modules. (B) Mary has some problems concerning the object as a whole.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Mary's attempt to solve different principles suggests that she is facing problems concerning the object as a whole, rather than just specific modules. She is trying different approaches to find a solution to the overall problem."}}
{"Q": "He is very knowledgeable about movement. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His major is kinesiology. (B) Tom is a sociologist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If someone is knowledgeable about movement, it is likely that they have studied it in some capacity. Kinesiology is the study of human movement, so it is more plausible that someone with a major in kinesiology would have a strong understanding of movement. On the other hand, being a sociologist does not necessarily require knowledge of movement."}}
{"Q": "The multiplet volume increases rapidly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The occurrence of flocculation had an obvious influence. (B) There are a lot of channels.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: When the multiplet volume increases rapidly, it indicates that the particles are coming closer together and there is a higher chance of flocculation occurring. Flocculation is the process of particles clumping together, which can have a significant impact on the properties of the system. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it explains the possible influence of flocculation on the system. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear explanation for the observed phenomenon."}}
{"Q": "He bought some equipment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Geophysicists trying to detect small movements in the Earth's crust appreaciated his invention. (B) He got some cloak devices.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Geophysicists trying to detect small movements in the Earth's crust appreciated his invention.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the equipment mentioned is likely related to geophysics, which is the study of the Earth's physical properties and processes. The fact that geophysicists appreciated his invention suggests that it was useful and innovative in their field. On the other hand, option B about cloak devices seems unlikely and unrelated to the context given."}}
{"Q": "This kingdom is rich in wines. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their  vines and bounty are envied by other kingdoms. (B) Their vines and bounty are envied by their king.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Their vines and bounty are envied by other kingdoms.\nExplanation: It is more likely that other kingdoms would envy the wine production of a kingdom that is rich in wines, rather than the king of the same kingdom envying it. Wine is a valuable commodity and a source of income, so it is reasonable to assume that other kingdoms would want to replicate the success of the wine production in this kingdom."}}
{"Q": "They orders fresh fruit from fruit stores. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The docter advices Lucy to eat fruits with much dietary fiber. (B) The restaurant sells Smoothies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is A because it provides a clear reason for why Lucy and her colleagues would order fresh fruit from fruit stores. The doctor's advice to eat fruits with much dietary fiber suggests that they are health-conscious and looking for ways to improve their diet. Ordering fresh fruit is a simple and convenient way to incorporate more fiber into their meals. On the other hand, option B is less likely because it doesn't explain why they would specifically order fresh fruit from fruit stores, rather than any other type of food supplier."}}
{"Q": "The whole problem solving process was wrong. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The tutor failed to sum up the central topic. (B) Tom has listed a wrong equation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If the tutor failed to sum up the central topic, then the students may have misunderstood the problem and approached it incorrectly. This could have led to the entire problem solving process being wrong. On the other hand, if Tom had listed a wrong equation, it would have only affected a specific part of the problem solving process, not the entire process. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Scientists cut off the lateral roots of ragweed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ragweed is still vigorous. (B) The ragweed withered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Cutting off the lateral roots of ragweed would severely limit its ability to absorb water and nutrients from the soil, leading to dehydration and eventual withering. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lake wants to work out full hard glute. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She had collected a lot of fresh chopped apple juice in season. (B) Lake's fitness instructor asked him to practice lunge.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Practicing lunges is a common exercise for targeting and strengthening the glutes. Therefore, it is a more plausible answer than collecting apple juice, which has no relation to working out the glutes."}}
{"Q": "Som oil was added to the carrier oil. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The carrier oil was diluted. (B) The mummy spilled oil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The carrier oil was diluted.\nExplanation: When oil is added to another oil, it will mix and create a solution. This will result in the carrier oil being diluted, meaning that the concentration of the carrier oil has decreased due to the addition of the other oil. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is not clear how the mummy is related to the situation and there is no information provided to suggest that the mummy spilled oil."}}
{"Q": "The Adhesives were exposed to oxygen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They hardened. (B) Oxidation occurred.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They hardened.\nExplanation: When adhesives are exposed to oxygen, they can undergo a process called polymerization, which causes them to harden and become more solid. This is a common reaction in many types of adhesives, such as cyanoacrylate (super glue) and epoxy. Oxidation can also occur in some adhesives, but it is not typically the primary cause of hardening."}}
{"Q": "He can't walk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is mentally handicapped. (B) Tom lost his legs before many years when he happened to a car accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom lost his legs before many years when he happened to a car accident. This would explain why he is unable to walk. Option A, that Tom is mentally handicapped, does not necessarily mean he cannot walk."}}
{"Q": "The boy followed him slipped too. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boy can get adequate nutrition everyday. (B) A boy slipped on the ice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) A boy slipped on the ice.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the boy followed him and slipped too, which implies that there was some slippery surface or obstacle that caused both of them to slip. Option (A) about adequate nutrition is not relevant to the given sentence and does not explain the cause of the slip. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He is also equipped with a helmet for safety. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is going to buy a bicycle. (B) Tom felt very scared when he saw a monster.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom is going to buy a bicycle.\nExplanation: It is common for people who ride bicycles to wear helmets for safety. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom is wearing a helmet because he is planning to buy a bicycle and wants to ensure his safety while riding it. Option B, which suggests that Tom is scared of a monster, is not a likely reason for wearing a helmet."}}
{"Q": "This tree has great viability. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It has great potential to germinate. (B) It can get nourishment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It has great potential to germinate.\nExplanation: Viability refers to the ability of a seed or organism to survive and grow. In the context of a tree, great viability means that the tree's seeds have a high potential to germinate and grow into healthy trees. This suggests that the tree is healthy and producing viable seeds, which is a positive outcome for the tree's reproductive success."}}
{"Q": "Tom has some biluminescenes in the sea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found that there were some dinoflagellates. (B) He found that there were bromine atoms in it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Bioluminescence in the sea is often caused by dinoflagellates, which are single-celled organisms that produce light through a chemical reaction. Bromine atoms are not typically associated with bioluminescence in the sea, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "There was a swan in the office. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It presence was indicated. (B) The official got the beautiful feather.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Its presence was indicated.\nExplanation: It is highly unlikely that a swan would be in an office, so its presence would be a notable event. Therefore, the most plausible outcome would be that its presence was indicated or noted by those in the office. Option B, about the official getting a feather, seems unlikely and irrelevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "It had been fifteen years since the aardwolf was born. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He need to consider the mass of neon inside this neon light. (B) It died before long.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It died before long.\nExplanation: Aardwolves have a lifespan of around 8-10 years in the wild and up to 15 years in captivity. Therefore, it is more plausible that the aardwolf mentioned in the question would have died before long rather than needing to consider the mass of neon inside a neon light."}}
{"Q": "The doctor found that his valve did not close when the heart contracted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Too much thyroxine was produced in the man's body. (B) There is something wrong with the patient's valve.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the valve not closing properly is a problem with the valve itself, such as a defect or damage. Too much thyroxine production can lead to other heart problems, but it is not directly related to valve function."}}
{"Q": "Jerry is allergic to lactose. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He may eat most unusual foods by mistake. (B) He may eat most usual milk by mistake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Since Jerry is allergic to lactose, he may accidentally consume milk or dairy products that contain lactose, which can cause an allergic reaction. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to his lactose intolerance. Option A is not as likely since it does not specifically address his allergy to lactose."}}
{"Q": "A pterosaur was running in the forest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) No one can run more fast than it. (B) He saw some ferns.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the choices are plausible as pterosaurs were not capable of running on land. They were flying reptiles and their primary mode of transportation was through the air. Therefore, it is unlikely that anything would happen as a result of a pterosaur running in the forest."}}
{"Q": "Tom was diagnosed with asexuality. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His wife felt he was ugly. (B) His wife has no sexual desire on him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His wife has no sexual desire on him.\nExplanation: Asexuality is a sexual orientation where a person does not experience sexual attraction towards anyone. It does not mean that the person is ugly or unattractive. Therefore, option (A) is not a plausible answer. However, if Tom's wife is sexually attracted to men, she may not have any sexual desire towards Tom due to his asexuality. Hence, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boys were trained with patterns. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They developed fixed habits. (B) Other boys followed to joint it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They developed fixed habits.\nExplanation: When someone is trained with patterns, they tend to repeat those patterns and develop fixed habits. This is because patterns create a sense of familiarity and comfort, making it easier for individuals to follow them repeatedly. Therefore, it is more plausible that the boys developed fixed habits as a result of their training with patterns. Option B is less likely as it does not necessarily follow that other boys would join in just because the first group was trained with patterns."}}
{"Q": "The leader of the orphanage decided to find a kind person for her to adopt her. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The orphan Lucy was sad when she saw a happy family. (B) Her mother abandoned her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Lucy is an orphan suggests that her mother is not present in her life. Therefore, it is more plausible that her mother abandoned her, rather than Lucy simply feeling sad when seeing a happy family. Additionally, the leader of the orphanage would not base such an important decision solely on a child's temporary emotional state."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's trainer is both a teacher and friend. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She extremely likes her trainer. (B) They go to school together everyday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Lucy's trainer is both a teacher and friend, it is likely that they have developed a close relationship. This would lead to Lucy having a positive attitude towards her trainer and liking them very much. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not necessarily follow from the given information."}}
{"Q": "He fell asleep in a few minutes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was lying in the bed and reading a book. (B) Tom laid down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom laid down.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom fell asleep because he laid down, as lying down is a common position for sleeping. Reading a book may have made him tired, but it is not a direct cause of falling asleep."}}
{"Q": "He hence did unit tests. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom desired to know the scientific explanation of the word. (B) Developer Edward was asked to optimize the design.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the developer, Edward, was asked to optimize the design, which would require unit testing to ensure that the changes made did not break any existing functionality. Tom's desire to know the scientific explanation of the word is not related to the need for unit testing."}}
{"Q": "Jack suffers from asthma. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Doctors diagnosed his son with asthma. (B) When he went to the hospital to do physical examination, his lung has been filled with shadow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Asthma is a respiratory condition that affects the lungs, causing inflammation and narrowing of the airways. This can lead to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Option A is not a plausible answer as asthma is not hereditary and cannot be passed down from a parent to a child. Option B is a more likely scenario as asthma can be diagnosed through physical examination and imaging tests such as X-rays, which may show shadows or other abnormalities in the lungs."}}
{"Q": "Tom put a magnet near some coins. . What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The coins were attracted together by the magnet. . (B) The perveived bond closely ties them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The coins were attracted together by the magnet.\nExplanation: When a magnet is brought near metal objects such as coins, it can create a magnetic field that attracts the metal objects towards it. This is due to the magnetic properties of the metal, which allows it to be affected by the magnetic field of the magnet. Therefore, the coins would be attracted towards the magnet and may even stick to it if they are made of a magnetic material. Choice B is not a plausible answer as it does not make sense in the context of the situation."}}
{"Q": "Too many activities have been hold in this city. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) More activities can be held. (B) Some residents were injured during these activities.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Holding too many activities in a city can lead to overcrowding, traffic congestion, and increased risk of accidents or injuries. It is more plausible that some residents were injured during these activities rather than more activities being able to be held."}}
{"Q": "The environment here is suitable for the family cercopithicidae. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are many mangabeys living here. (B) The coral reefs are growing well.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There are many mangabeys living here.\nExplanation: The family cercopithicidae includes Old World monkeys such as mangabeys, which are known to inhabit forested areas. Therefore, if the environment is suitable for this family, it is likely that there are many mangabeys living in the area. On the other hand, coral reefs have nothing to do with this family, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The cloth was cut for oxygen to get in. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The acne bacteria was wet under thick water. (B) The acne bacteria was blocked under thick cloth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The acne bacteria was blocked under thick cloth.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the cloth was cut for oxygen to get in, which implies that something was being blocked or prevented from receiving oxygen. The context of the sentence suggests that the cloth was covering something, and the most likely scenario is that it was covering the acne bacteria. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) does not make sense in this context as it talks about the bacteria being wet under water, which is not related to the cloth being cut for oxygen."}}
{"Q": "John found a dent in the ground. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The beaker was broken into pieces. (B) John put on his the reading glasses to see the ground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option A is not a plausible answer as it mentions a beaker which is not related to the dent in the ground. Option B is more plausible as it suggests that John may have been inspecting the ground closely and noticed the dent."}}
{"Q": "In addition to the daily food, I also put aquatic insects into merganser's nest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The next day I found the merganser starved to death. (B) The next day I found that the aquatic insects had been eaten.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The next day I found that the aquatic insects had been eaten.\nExplanation: Mergansers are known to feed on aquatic insects, so it is likely that they would eat the insects that were put into their nest. It is unlikely that the merganser would starve to death overnight if it had been receiving daily food and had access to additional food sources in its environment."}}
{"Q": "A salesman visited her and recommend her some laundry detergents. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was impressed with the salesman’ politeness. (B) I couldn't help praising the visitors.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She was impressed with the salesman's politeness.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the salesman recommended some laundry detergents to her. It does not mention anything about the quality of the detergents or whether she bought them. However, it does mention that the salesman visited her and recommended the detergents, implying that he was polite and professional. Therefore, it is more plausible that she was impressed with his politeness rather than the speaker praising the visitor without any context."}}
{"Q": "Some parasites lay their eggs on cloves. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A few days later the eggs died. (B) After a few days, the eggs turned into parasites.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) After a few days, the eggs turned into parasites.\nExplanation: Some parasites lay their eggs on cloves as a way to ensure their offspring have a food source when they hatch. Once the eggs hatch, the larvae will feed on the clove until they are ready to move on to a new host. Therefore, it is more plausible that the eggs would turn into parasites rather than die a few days later."}}
{"Q": "He gave it back to the jockey. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom picked up a whip. (B) Tom collected some seawater.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom picked up a whip.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the jockey had dropped or lost his whip during the race and Tom picked it up and returned it to him. Collecting seawater does not seem to be related to the jockey or the situation."}}
{"Q": "I began to look for the orioles hidden in it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I heard bird songs from green leaves. (B) I noticed that there are several caves dug by woodpeckers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is A because hearing bird songs from green leaves is a common indication that birds are present in the area. Orioles are known for their distinct and melodious songs, which could have caught the attention of the person and prompted them to look for the birds. On the other hand, option B about woodpecker caves does not necessarily relate to the presence of orioles."}}
{"Q": "The workers have prepared some silts. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They plan to utilise them to build walls. (B) The gulls ate the meat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They plan to utilise them to build walls.\nExplanation: Since the workers have prepared silts, it is more likely that they plan to use them for construction purposes rather than feeding them to gulls. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She studies the relations among different creatures. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy majors in ecology. (B) The psycological expert is American.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lucy majors in ecology.\nExplanation: Ecology is the study of the relationships between organisms and their environment. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy's interest in studying the relations among different creatures is due to her majoring in ecology. On the other hand, the fact that the psychological expert is American is not relevant to the given statement."}}
{"Q": "He found that adhesion had occurred. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The man looked at the areas. (B) He put the cells in contact with the surface.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Adhesion occurs when two surfaces come into contact with each other. Therefore, the most plausible cause of adhesion in this scenario is that the man put the cells in contact with the surface. Looking at the areas alone would not cause adhesion to occur."}}
{"Q": "A robin is hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It flies to the ground for food. (B) He measured the heart rate of the bird.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: When a robin is hungry, it will typically fly down to the ground to search for food, such as worms or insects. Option B, measuring the bird's heart rate, is not a plausible result of the robin being hungry."}}
{"Q": "They first left Beijing and started from Shanghai. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Farmers want to grow legume crops. (B) They decided to travel China this summer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They decided to travel China this summer.\nExplanation: There is no indication in the sentence that farmers want to grow legume crops, so option (A) can be ruled out. However, the sentence clearly states that they \"started from Shanghai,\" implying that they had a specific destination in mind and were traveling intentionally. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was allowed three days of extra holiday and he returned his home. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was honored as a hero because of his brave deed. (B) Through the ancient Silk Road, China and the West exchanged tea, silk, porcelain, glass, gemstones, wool, etc.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that he was allowed extra holiday, which suggests that he did something deserving of recognition or reward. Option A states that he was honored as a hero because of his brave deed, which is a plausible reason for receiving extra holiday. Option B is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide a logical explanation for the extra holiday."}}
{"Q": "He was the final winner of the game. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fisherman got a bluefin. (B) Tom has a strong ability to survival.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"he was the final winner of the game\", implying that there was a competition or challenge of some sort. The only option that suggests a possible reason for winning is option A, which states that the fisherman got a bluefin. This could mean that the game involved fishing, and catching a bluefin is a difficult and impressive feat that could have secured the win for him. Option B, on the other hand, is too vague and does not provide any specific reason for his victory."}}
{"Q": "Jason and I saw a mammal passing along. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He told me there is a good chance that this mammal is a artiodactyl. (B) He told me there is a good chance that this mammal is an artiodactyl.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: The correct answer is B because \"an\" is the correct indefinite article to use before a word that starts with a vowel sound, such as \"artiodactyl.\" \"A\" is used before words that start with a consonant sound. Therefore, \"an artiodactyl\" is more grammatically correct than \"a artiodactyl.\""}}
{"Q": "The scientists injected nitrite into child blood. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The scientists found that the oxygen carrying capacity of the child's blood declined. (B) The feces could not be excreted out of the anus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Nitrite can react with hemoglobin in the blood to form methemoglobin, which cannot carry oxygen. Therefore, injecting nitrite into a child's blood would result in a decline in the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Option B is not related to the injection of nitrite and is not a plausible outcome."}}
{"Q": "We saw something plunge-diving from the air. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) No one explained the phenomenon for us. (B) The teacher explained it was a booby getting its food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The teacher explained that it was a booby getting its food, which is a plausible explanation for something plunge-diving from the air. This suggests that the teacher had knowledge about the behavior of boobies and was able to provide an explanation for the observed phenomenon. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that no explanation was given, which is less likely in a learning environment where teachers are expected to provide explanations for observed phenomena."}}
{"Q": "The star is burned and squeezed into ashes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A star crashes into a cloud of dust. (B) A star crashes into the sun where nucleosynthesis occurs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When a star runs out of fuel, it can no longer produce the energy needed to counteract the force of gravity. This causes the star to collapse in on itself, resulting in a supernova explosion. During this explosion, nucleosynthesis occurs, which is the process of creating new elements through fusion reactions. The intense pressure and temperature cause the star's core to fuse heavier elements, eventually leading to the formation of iron. However, once the core is mostly made up of iron, fusion reactions can no longer occur, and the core collapses in on itself, causing the star to explode and leave behind a remnant such as a neutron star or black hole. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it describes the natural process of a star's life cycle."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's mother took use of astragalus to make food for her. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She usually eats Hamburgs. (B) Lucy becomes much healthier than before.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Astragalus is known for its immune-boosting properties and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. By incorporating it into Lucy's diet, her immune system may become stronger, leading to improved overall health. Eating hamburgers, as mentioned in choice A, would not have any direct correlation to the effects of astragalus."}}
{"Q": "Mineral-rich herb is good to human body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought some chickweed to build his body. (B) People almost intake protein every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that a mineral-rich herb is good for the human body, so the most plausible answer would be that the person bought some chickweed to build his body. Chickweed is known to be a mineral-rich herb that is used for various health benefits, including improving digestion, reducing inflammation, and promoting weight loss. Therefore, it makes sense that the person would choose to consume chickweed to improve their overall health and well-being. Option B, on the other hand, is not directly related to the statement and does not provide a logical explanation for the situation."}}
{"Q": "The scientist applied some nitrogen fertilizer to the lawn. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The lawn has absorbed nitrogen fertilizer. (B) Suddenly it began to rain.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The lawn has absorbed nitrogen fertilizer.\nExplanation: When nitrogen fertilizer is applied to a lawn, it is absorbed by the grass and helps it to grow. This is a common practice in lawn care to promote healthy and lush grass. Option B, sudden rain, may or may not happen, but it is not a direct result of applying nitrogen fertilizer."}}
{"Q": "Tom eats dairies every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is no longer constipated. (B) He kept health.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Eating dairies every day may not necessarily cure constipation, but it can contribute to maintaining overall health if consumed in moderation and as part of a balanced diet. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My major is anthropology. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Blood clots may bring me pain sometimes. (B) I study people in different culture settings everyday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: If someone's major is anthropology, it means they are studying the social and cultural aspects of human beings. Therefore, it is more plausible that they study people in different cultural settings every day rather than experiencing pain from blood clots."}}
{"Q": "He is getting smarter and smarter than before. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Frank eats nutritious food every day. (B) Rabbit is a kind of rodent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Eating nutritious food can improve brain function and cognitive abilities, leading to increased intelligence. Therefore, it is more plausible that Frank's improved intelligence is due to his daily consumption of nutritious food. The statement about rabbits being rodents is irrelevant and does not contribute to the explanation of Frank's increased intelligence."}}
{"Q": "Mary found the extrusion of a mass through her vagina. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The diagnosis showed that this was prolapse. (B) It became a female.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The diagnosis showed that this was prolapse.\nExplanation: Prolapse is a medical condition where an organ or tissue falls or slips out of its normal position. In this case, the extrusion of a mass through the vagina is a symptom of prolapse. It is not possible for the mass to become a female, as it is not a living organism. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He enjoys the process of making still images appear alive through the action of motion. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The artist is good at serifs. (B) He likes making animations.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He likes making animations.\nExplanation: The statement clearly mentions that the artist enjoys the process of making still images appear alive through the action of motion. This indicates that the artist has a passion for creating animations, which involves adding motion to still images. Option (A) about being good at serifs is irrelevant to the statement and does not explain the artist's interest in animation. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She found that there was somehting in common with actinide. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary misused clozapine. (B) Lucy recenly did a reserach about berkelium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Lucy recently did research about berkelium, which is an actinide element. Therefore, she may have found something in common with actinides due to her research. Option A is not related to the question and seems irrelevant."}}
{"Q": "Tom loses his sheep once a week. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are several ocelots near Tom's farm. (B) Tom is a dragoon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The presence of ocelots near Tom's farm is a more plausible explanation for his sheep going missing once a week, as ocelots are known to prey on sheep. Tom being a dragoon is not a likely cause for his sheep going missing."}}
{"Q": "Trainers have changes of energy in their body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Metabolism indicates change of energy. (B) Hearing has three dimensions and the first two dimensions are known to normal people.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Metabolism is the process by which the body converts food into energy. Therefore, changes in metabolism can indicate changes in energy levels within the body. On the other hand, hearing and its dimensions have no direct correlation with changes in energy levels in the body."}}
{"Q": "Grace's father caught a babirusa. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Grace couldn't bite its meat at dinner. (B) He should take some colchicine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Grace couldn't bite its meat at dinner.\nExplanation: Babirusa is a type of wild pig found in Indonesia. It is considered a protected species and hunting it is illegal. Therefore, catching a babirusa would be a violation of the law. The question implies that Grace's father caught the babirusa, which means he committed a crime. As a result, Grace couldn't eat its meat at dinner because it was obtained illegally. Choice B, \"He should take some colchicine,\" is unrelated and doesn't make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The waitress walked to him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom farted in class. (B) The guest asks for a new plate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The guest asks for a new plate.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the waitress walked to the guest because they asked for a new plate, rather than Tom farting in class, which is unrelated to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Lina went into her bedroom carelessly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was tripped by the chair. (B) Her baby is no healthy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She was tripped by the chair.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lina tripped over a chair in her bedroom due to her careless entry, rather than her baby suddenly becoming unhealthy as a result of her actions."}}
{"Q": "I knew he told a lie. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary is a film producer. (B) He said he saw leprechauns yesterday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of him telling a lie is that he claimed to have seen leprechauns, which is an unlikely and fantastical event. Mary being a film producer has no relevance to the situation and does not provide a reason for him to lie."}}
{"Q": "More tubes are needed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John prepares to make paper. (B) Fresh air should be delivered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. John prepares to make paper.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that more tubes are needed, which implies that John is in the process of making paper. Tubes are commonly used in papermaking to transport materials such as water, pulp, and chemicals. Therefore, it is more plausible that John's papermaking process requires additional tubes rather than the need for fresh air delivery."}}
{"Q": "The queen begins to increase her egg laying rate at that time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It's time for thrushes to propagate. (B) Having pollen stored up is something the bees are keeping for mid-late winter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the queen increasing her egg laying rate is likely due to the fact that the bees have stored up pollen for mid-late winter. This provides the necessary resources for the colony to support a larger brood, which in turn increases the chances of survival for the colony as a whole. The timing of thrush propagation is not likely to have a direct impact on the queen's egg laying rate."}}
{"Q": "It cannot communicate with other bees about the food sources. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The character Feeder is useless in the game. (B) This bee hurts and cannot dance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: In real life, bees communicate about food sources through a dance called the waggle dance. If a bee is unable to dance due to injury or physical limitations, it would not be able to communicate with other bees about food sources. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) is not relevant to the question and does not provide a logical explanation for the bee's inability to communicate about food sources."}}
{"Q": "John has a pest infestation in his garden. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought some medicine to get rid of squash bugs. (B) He put traps in the bushes at night, and caught some jackrabbits the next morning.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that John would buy medicine to get rid of squash bugs, as they are a common pest in gardens and there are many products available specifically for this purpose. Putting traps in the bushes at night to catch jackrabbits is less likely to be effective for a pest infestation in a garden, and may even be illegal depending on the location."}}
{"Q": "All aspects of society should be responsible for his death. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He died last month. (B) Litter killed the cleaner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Litter killed the cleaner.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the cleaner died due to the negligence of society in properly disposing of their litter. Litter can pose a serious threat to the health and safety of individuals, and it is the responsibility of society to ensure that it is properly disposed of. The fact that the question states that \"all aspects of society\" should be responsible further supports the idea that this was a preventable death caused by societal negligence."}}
{"Q": "Jack is an oceanographer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is used to the seasonal variability. (B) He is at sea all the year round.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: As an oceanographer, Jack studies the ocean and its various aspects such as currents, tides, marine life, and weather patterns. This requires him to have a good understanding of the seasonal variability of the ocean. Therefore, it is more plausible that he is used to the seasonal variability rather than being at sea all year round."}}
{"Q": "Tim learnt more knowledge with the growth of age. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His pursuits became easier for him. (B) He becomes more excellent than before.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: As Tim gained more knowledge with age, it is likely that he became more excellent than before. With more knowledge, he would have developed new skills and abilities, and would have been able to approach tasks and challenges with greater confidence and expertise. While his pursuits may have become easier for him, it is more likely that he became more capable and accomplished overall."}}
{"Q": "He would have to travel a long distances. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man wished to reach Mercury in the atmosphere. (B) The cerebral cortex of his brain was damaged.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option A is not a plausible answer as it is impossible for a human to reach Mercury in the atmosphere due to its extreme temperatures and lack of atmosphere. Option B is a more plausible answer as damage to the cerebral cortex can affect a person's ability to navigate and make decisions, leading to longer travel times."}}
{"Q": "All students have watsed some rice and thrown them. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are more people starving. (B) They are just like scavengers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There are more people starving.\nExplanation: If all students have wasted some rice and thrown them, it means that there is a significant amount of food being wasted. This could contribute to food scarcity and increase the number of people who are starving. It is important to reduce food waste and ensure that food is distributed to those who need it. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is a derogatory term and does not provide any explanation or solution to the problem."}}
{"Q": "The hunter wants to hunt the deer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He thought it was too noisy. (B) He was always following the deer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the hunter wants to hunt the deer, it is more plausible that he would be following the deer rather than finding it too noisy. Following the deer would increase his chances of successfully hunting it."}}
{"Q": "I crave for food. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was starved for days. (B) The trout scrounged for food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the person was starved for days, as hunger is a natural response to lack of food. Option B, about the trout, is not related to the person's craving for food."}}
{"Q": "A long shower made my skin lost moisture. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I ran to buy unguent to treat white patches. (B) I saw the Shrinkage on my body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: When the skin loses moisture, it can lead to shrinkage or tightening of the skin. This is because the water in the skin helps to keep it plump and elastic. If the skin becomes too dry, it can also lead to itching, flaking, and even cracking, but it is less likely to cause white patches that would require unguent."}}
{"Q": "The living environment here is harsh. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The residents here are in good health. (B) The health of residents is affected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the harsh living environment would have a negative impact on the health of the residents. Harsh living conditions can lead to exposure to extreme temperatures, poor air quality, and lack of access to clean water and nutritious food, all of which can contribute to health problems."}}
{"Q": "They poured a lot of waste water into the river. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The amount of pollutants they emit exceeds the limit. (B) James was eventually poisoned.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The amount of pollutants they emit exceeds the limit.\nExplanation: When a lot of waste water is poured into a river, it can lead to an increase in the amount of pollutants in the water. This can cause harm to the aquatic life and also make the water unsafe for human consumption. It is important to regulate the amount of waste water that is released into rivers to prevent environmental damage. James being poisoned is not a plausible answer as it is not mentioned in the given information."}}
{"Q": "Water was used as as a new source of electricity. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom filled the bath tub with hot water. (B) This hydro-energetic power manifested its own drawbacks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the correct answer as it suggests that there were some negative consequences of using water as a new source of electricity. This is a more plausible answer as every new technology or innovation has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Option A is irrelevant and does not provide any information related to the consequences of using water as a source of electricity."}}
{"Q": "They are afraid of being hurt, so they walked and ate the food in Tom's hands. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are some colugos. (B) Tom has seen a lot of rhes and he bought some food for them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of their fear and subsequent action of walking and eating the food in Tom's hands is that Tom has seen a lot of rhes and bought some food for them. This suggests that the animals may have had negative experiences with humans in the past and are cautious around them."}}
{"Q": "The teacher said that kilograms should be used. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The students don't know what to represent the weight of a bull. (B) The teacher asked the student gave detail descriptions on this word.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The students don't know what to represent the weight of a bull.\nExplanation: The use of kilograms is a standard unit of measurement for weight, and it is likely that the teacher recommended this unit because the students may not be familiar with other units of measurement or may not know how to accurately represent the weight of a bull in other units. Therefore, using kilograms would provide a clear and consistent way to measure the weight of the bull."}}
{"Q": "Tom suffers from diabete. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He chooses barley as his staple food. (B) Tom can only eat food with sweeteners when he wants to eat sugar.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Since Tom suffers from diabetes, he needs to control his blood sugar levels. Consuming food with sweeteners instead of sugar can help him achieve this. However, choosing barley as his staple food may not necessarily be a direct result of his condition."}}
{"Q": "Cedar shrinks in the smallest sense. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Robins cocked their heads. (B) When it comes to winter, trees begin to shrink.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Cedar trees, like many other trees, experience a decrease in moisture content during the winter months. This loss of moisture causes the cells in the wood to shrink, resulting in the overall shrinkage of the tree. The presence of robins cocking their heads would not have any significant impact on the shrinkage of the cedar tree. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He used vinegar. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wanted to remove hard water deposits from glassware. (B) Tom wants to made some cider.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Vinegar is commonly used as a natural cleaning agent and can effectively remove hard water deposits from glassware. It is unlikely that someone would use vinegar to make cider, as cider is typically made from apples or other fruit. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Our teacher informed us that it was chemiluminescence. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We were curious about the light produced after a chemical reaction. (B) We wanted to know the smallest known agents of infectious disease.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Chemiluminescence is the emission of light as a result of a chemical reaction. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the light was due to the curiosity of the students about the light produced after a chemical reaction, rather than their interest in the smallest known agents of infectious disease."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought some bricks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He built his own Cuckoo house. (B) He built a wall.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He built a wall.\nExplanation: While it is possible that Tom could have built his own Cuckoo house with the bricks, it is more likely that he used them to build a wall. Bricks are commonly used in construction for building walls, so this answer is more plausible."}}
{"Q": "Tom has put a bismuth into the beaker. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found that the bismuth was oxidized after several hours. (B) There are more carbon dioxide in the air.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Bismuth is a metal that is not very reactive, so it is unlikely to react with the air or carbon dioxide. Therefore, option A is more plausible as it suggests that the bismuth underwent a chemical reaction and was oxidized over time."}}
{"Q": "ADIS's brain is always congested. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Crittes loiter around people's houses. (B) ADIS's doctor says ADIS's brain always unabated thinking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: According to ADIS's doctor, the cause of ADIS's congested brain is unabated thinking. This is a more plausible answer than crittes loitering around people's houses, as there is no evidence or explanation given for how crittes could cause brain congestion. On the other hand, it is possible for someone to experience mental congestion or overwhelm due to excessive thinking or mental activity."}}
{"Q": "The number of lumber farms around the city has increased. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The city has a large output of newspapers. (B) The small city focuses on economic development.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The small city focuses on economic development.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the increase in lumber farms is due to the city's focus on economic development, rather than the output of newspapers. Lumber farming can be a profitable industry and the city may have provided incentives or resources for businesses to start or expand in this area."}}
{"Q": "They were unable to make appropriate decisions. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They asked their team of experts for suggestions. (B) I found a linear molecule of acetylene with all four atoms in a straight line.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They asked their team of experts for suggestions.\nExplanation: When individuals are unable to make appropriate decisions, seeking advice and suggestions from a team of experts can be a helpful solution. This allows for a diverse range of perspectives and expertise to be considered, leading to a more informed decision-making process. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the given situation."}}
{"Q": "/p/ can be realized in many ways in actual articulations. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) /p/ cannot represent them all. (B) These speech sounds were represented by the phenem /p/.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: /p/ is a phoneme, which means it represents a group of speech sounds that are perceived as the same sound by speakers of a language. However, in actual articulations, /p/ can be realized in many ways depending on factors such as the speaker's individual anatomy, speaking style, and surrounding sounds. For example, /p/ can be aspirated (with a puff of air), unaspirated (without a puff of air), or even unreleased (with no audible release of air). Because of this variation, /p/ cannot represent all the possible ways it can be realized, and some linguists use additional symbols or diacritics to indicate specific realizations of /p/."}}
{"Q": "Tom drink a glass of lemonade. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His dream has come true. (B) Tom was full.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Drinking a glass of lemonade would likely quench Tom's thirst and possibly make him feel full, but it would not fulfill a dream. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He went on to study radiology. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John was interested in the study of human images. (B) He chooses to study biochemistry in university.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. John was interested in the study of human images.\nExplanation: The sentence states that John \"went on\" to study radiology, implying that he had some prior interest or background in the field. The fact that radiology involves the study and interpretation of medical images supports choice A as the more plausible answer. Choice B is not relevant to the given information and does not provide a logical reason for John's decision to study radiology."}}
{"Q": "The old woman wants to have food every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She tries her best to play. (B) She tries her best to go to prison.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She tries her best to play.\nExplanation: The statement about the old woman wanting food every day does not suggest any negative consequences or actions that would lead her to try her best to go to prison. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the old woman is trying her best to play or participate in activities that would help her obtain food every day."}}
{"Q": "The illiterary woman has no idea about election. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are several new bulges on his back today. (B) She wouldn't know the idea of the chosen people.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She wouldn't know the idea of the chosen people. \nExplanation: The fact that the illiterate woman has no idea about elections suggests that she lacks knowledge about the political process and how it works. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would understand the concept of \"chosen people\" in any context. Option A is unrelated and does not make sense in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "He suffers from leptospirosis now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man once contacted with contaminated rat urine. (B) Tom had found his weakness but did not correct it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The man once contacted with contaminated rat urine.\nExplanation: Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that is commonly spread through contact with the urine of infected animals, particularly rats. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man contracted leptospirosis from contact with contaminated rat urine rather than Tom finding his weakness and not correcting it."}}
{"Q": "The boy adopted many results to refute her. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary kept several swallows. (B) The boy was opposed to her idea.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence states that the boy adopted many results to refute her, indicating that he was actively opposing her idea. The fact that Mary kept several swallows is not relevant to the cause of the boy's actions. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The scientists found lots of leucocytes accumulated in this cut swallowing bacteria. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The factory has bought a lot of pulp. (B) The cut was inflamed because of the invading bacteria.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The cut was inflamed because of the invading bacteria.\nExplanation: Leucocytes, also known as white blood cells, are a part of the body's immune system and are responsible for fighting off infections and foreign invaders such as bacteria. The accumulation of leucocytes in the cut indicates that the body is responding to an infection, which is likely caused by the invading bacteria. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) about the factory buying pulp is unrelated and does not explain the presence of leucocytes in the cut."}}
{"Q": "Then people use the satiety of bananas to lose weight. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Resistant starch is difficult to digest. (B) Flavonoids are good for our health.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Bananas contain resistant starch, which is a type of carbohydrate that is not fully broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. This means that it can help people feel fuller for longer periods of time, which can lead to reduced calorie intake and weight loss. Flavonoids, while beneficial for health, do not directly contribute to satiety and weight loss in the same way that resistant starch does."}}
{"Q": "Mary likes to eat vegetables without appearance. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary doesn't likes to eat parsley. (B) Mary doeesn't likes to eat carrot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer.\nExplanation: The statement \"Mary likes to eat vegetables without appearance\" does not provide enough information to determine which specific vegetables Mary likes or dislikes. It only suggests that Mary may prefer vegetables that do not have a strong visual appearance, such as leafy greens or root vegetables that are not brightly colored. Therefore, neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She decides to study economy in college. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy is a person with much vanity. (B) Mary wants to make the best of her life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Mary's desire to make the best of her life is a more plausible reason for her decision to study economy in college. Vanity is not a strong enough motivator for such a significant decision."}}
{"Q": "The helicopter came to another hemisphere of Earth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The pilot saw streams on the moon. (B) The pilot saw jet streams.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The pilot saw jet streams.\nExplanation: It is not possible for a helicopter to reach the moon, so option (A) is not plausible. However, when flying to a different hemisphere on Earth, the pilot may encounter different weather patterns and atmospheric conditions, including jet streams, which are high-altitude air currents that can affect the speed and direction of the helicopter. Therefore, option (B) is a more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "They sleep together. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy has many sexual relationships with different men. (B) These two are heterosexuals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The fact that they sleep together does not necessarily imply that Lucy has many sexual relationships with different men. It is more plausible that they are heterosexuals who are in a romantic or sexual relationship with each other."}}
{"Q": "The police fired a shot. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The birds on the tree were scared away. (B) They took us in.", "R": {"text": "Answer: They took us in.\nExplanation: The statement \"The police fired a shot\" suggests that a serious incident occurred, possibly involving a crime or a dangerous situation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the police would take action and apprehend those involved, rather than simply scaring away birds. Option (B) \"They took us in\" implies that the police arrested or detained someone, which is a likely outcome in such a scenario."}}
{"Q": "His mother took use of fumigation and made sure that seafood are clean. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to eat some seafood. (B) There is a lot of dust where Tom works.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The use of fumigation and cleaning of seafood suggests that the cause was related to hygiene and cleanliness. Option B provides a more plausible reason as dust can contaminate food and cause health issues. Option A does not provide a clear reason for the actions taken by Tom's mother."}}
{"Q": "Tom loves smiling. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He always felt the happiness inside the consciousness. (B) Tom often feels happy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom often feels happy as a result of loving to smile, rather than always feeling happiness inside his consciousness. Smiling is known to release endorphins, which can improve mood and increase feelings of happiness. Therefore, it is likely that Tom's love for smiling leads to him feeling happy more often."}}
{"Q": "All of generations accepted and took use of them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) During her time in office, Margaret Thatcher introduced a series of tough reforms. (B) The philosophers have proposed a lot of true perceptions which are beneficial to poeple's life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the reason for all generations accepting and using certain things is due to the philosophers proposing true perceptions that are beneficial to people's lives. This is a more plausible answer than choice A, which is unrelated to the statement. Philosophers have contributed to various fields such as ethics, politics, and science, and their ideas have influenced society for centuries. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that their proposals have been accepted and utilized by different generations."}}
{"Q": "The diver visited many ocean basins. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found beautiful seamounts. (B) He saw a lot f yellowfins and dolphins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He found beautiful seamounts.\nExplanation: Since the diver visited many ocean basins, it is more likely that he would come across different underwater landscapes and geological formations such as seamounts. While it is possible that he could have also seen yellowfins and dolphins, the statement does not provide enough information to suggest that this was a direct result of visiting multiple ocean basins."}}
{"Q": "We plan to see ringtails. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The guide suggested us going to mangrove areas. (B) We will go to the habitats.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the plan is to see ringtails, and as a result, the decision is to go to their habitats. Choice A may be a possible suggestion from a guide, but it does not directly answer the question of what happened as a result of the plan to see ringtails."}}
{"Q": "He won MVP in the game. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The palyer wants to rank top in the game. (B) He is a soccer player and good at heading the ball.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The fact that he is good at heading the ball suggests that he played a soccer game and his performance in the game led to him winning the MVP award. Choice (A) is not a plausible explanation as wanting to rank top in the game does not necessarily guarantee winning the MVP award."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have discovered the permanent magnetic moment of atoms. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists study the paramagnetism of atoms. (B) The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Scientists were able to discover the permanent magnetic moment of atoms by studying the paramagnetism of atoms. Paramagnetism is the property of certain materials that causes them to be weakly attracted to magnetic fields. By studying the behavior of atoms in magnetic fields, scientists were able to determine the permanent magnetic moment of atoms. The second choice, about myofibrils and myofilaments, is unrelated to the topic of magnetic moments of atoms."}}
{"Q": "There was an accident. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A journalist was explaining it to the audience. (B) He has a tendency to be affected by mental disease.", "R": {"text": "Answer: It is impossible to determine the result of the accident based on the given choices. Neither option provides any information about the actual outcome of the accident."}}
{"Q": "The pressure in the tank has increased. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The plane was flying above the Atlantic. (B) The temperature has risen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The temperature has risen.\nExplanation: An increase in temperature causes an increase in pressure in a closed container, such as a tank. Therefore, it is more plausible that the pressure in the tank increased due to a rise in temperature rather than the plane flying above the Atlantic."}}
{"Q": "I have seen fleas's three stages in their lifecycle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They complete their life cycle over two years. (B) Fleas have at least three stages.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement confirms that fleas have at least three stages in their lifecycle, which is a commonly known fact. Option A is not a plausible answer as the completion of a flea's life cycle typically takes around 2-3 weeks, not two years."}}
{"Q": "The flower was beautiful and fragrant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Soon it achieved significant growth. (B) Lucy went to smell it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Lucy went to smell it.\nExplanation: The sentence only mentions the beauty and fragrance of the flower, and does not provide any information about its growth or any other outcome. However, the mention of its fragrance suggests that someone might have been attracted to it, and the most likely scenario is that Lucy went to smell it."}}
{"Q": "The farmers planted many crops. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Grain can be used to make food. (B) The country developed much better in economy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: When farmers plant crops, they can harvest them and use them for various purposes, including making food. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of planting many crops is that grain can be used to make food. While planting crops can contribute to a country's economy, it is not necessarily a direct result of planting crops."}}
{"Q": "I've been feeling under stress lately. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Various health problems prevail these days. (B) Doctors often prescribe this medicine to patients.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Various health problems prevail these days.\nExplanation: Stress can have a negative impact on our physical and mental health. It can lead to various health problems such as headaches, high blood pressure, digestive issues, and weakened immune system. Therefore, it is plausible that feeling under stress lately could result in various health problems prevailing."}}
{"Q": "This two kids will go to skiing this afternoon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have no choice. (B) Their parents asked them to wear protective clothing in case of accidents.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Their parents asked them to wear protective clothing in case of accidents.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it is common for parents to remind their children to wear protective clothing when engaging in physical activities such as skiing to prevent injuries. The fact that the kids are going skiing implies that they have a choice to go, so option A is not a suitable answer."}}
{"Q": "He should take on more responsibilities. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom became a father. (B) Tom is a vicar.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Becoming a father often leads to increased responsibilities as one has to take care of their child and provide for their needs. Being a vicar may also involve responsibilities, but it may not necessarily lead to an increase in responsibilities outside of their job duties."}}
{"Q": "Lisa is an architect. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa designs buildings. (B) She eats croutons everyday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lisa designs buildings.\nExplanation: As an architect, Lisa's profession is to design buildings. It is a logical and expected result of her job title. Eating croutons everyday has no correlation with being an architect, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The petechiae might turn into eccchymoses. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The petechiae on his arm became pimples. (B) The petechiae on his arm became much bigger.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The petechiae on his arm became much bigger.\nExplanation: Petechiae are small, pinpoint-sized red or purple spots on the skin caused by bleeding under the skin. If the bleeding continues, the petechiae may merge and form larger areas of bleeding called ecchymoses or bruises. Therefore, it is more plausible that the petechiae on the arm became much bigger and turned into ecchymoses rather than turning into pimples."}}
{"Q": "Mosquitos are ubiquitous around here. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We can raise some bullfrogs. (B) There is a lot of mud.", "R": {"text": "Answer: We can raise some bullfrogs.\nExplanation: Bullfrogs are natural predators of mosquitoes and can help control their population. This is a more plausible answer than \"there is a lot of mud\" which does not have any direct correlation with the presence of mosquitoes."}}
{"Q": "Fishermen harvest many fish with broad flat bills and many of them are hurt by the tooth-like notches. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is the time of trumpeters recently. (B) The most impressed was the beautiful but different heads they have.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The given information about fishermen harvesting fish with broad flat bills and the fish being hurt by tooth-like notches does not relate to the time of trumpeters. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer. On the other hand, option B talks about the heads of the fish, which could be a distinguishing feature that impressed the fishermen. This could be a plausible explanation for why the fishermen were harvesting these fish despite the harm caused by the notches."}}
{"Q": "Faeries like living in it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The nature is the gift for the whole world. (B) There is a tree in the garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The presence of a tree in the garden is a more plausible reason for faeries to like living in it. Trees are often associated with magic and mystical creatures, and it is believed that faeries are particularly drawn to them. The tree may provide shelter, food, or a place for the faeries to gather and socialize. Therefore, it is more likely that the tree is the cause of the faeries' attraction to the garden."}}
{"Q": "He attacked her without proof. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is quite a lunatic. (B) Midwifes came to her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Midwifes came to her.\nExplanation: Since the sentence mentions \"attacked her\", it is likely that the woman was physically harmed. Therefore, it is plausible that midwives came to her aid to provide medical attention or assistance. Option A, stating that he is a lunatic, is not a logical consequence of the given information."}}
{"Q": "The boletes decayed this afternoon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary bought some boletes from the market this morning. (B) Biologists sealed the food for preservation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mary bought some boletes from the market this morning.\nExplanation: Boletes are a type of mushroom that can spoil quickly if not stored properly. If Mary bought the boletes from the market in the morning, they may have already been close to spoiling or not stored properly. This could have caused them to decay by the afternoon. Option B, biologists sealing the food for preservation, does not make sense as it would actually prevent decay rather than cause it."}}
{"Q": "He holds securities in a fractional ownership stake in this company now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought some stock. (B) He likes the women in this company.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He bought some stock.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for someone to hold securities in a company is that they have purchased stock in that company. Option B, which suggests that the person likes the women in the company, is not a logical reason for holding securities."}}
{"Q": "Jack is a monotheist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His car crasshed into the tree. (B) He believes there is just one god in the world.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: As a monotheist, Jack believes in the existence of only one god, which is the most likely result of his religious belief. Option A is not related to his religious belief and seems like an unrelated event."}}
{"Q": "He is suffering from arteriosclerosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor found that the cells on Tom's arm began to move inwards. (B) Calcium deposits in Tom's arteries.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Calcium deposits in Tom's arteries.\nExplanation: Arteriosclerosis is a condition where the arteries become hardened and narrowed due to the buildup of plaque, which is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances. Calcium deposits in the arteries can cause them to become stiff and less flexible, leading to arteriosclerosis. Choice (A) is not a plausible cause of arteriosclerosis as the movement of cells on Tom's arm would not directly affect his arteries."}}
{"Q": "The forest covers a vast area. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mangabeys took over the forest. (B) This forest is rich in resources.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the forest covers a vast area, which suggests that it is not likely that mangabeys alone could have taken over such a large space. On the other hand, the fact that the forest is rich in resources could explain why it has been able to sustain itself and grow over time. This could include factors such as fertile soil, ample water sources, and a diverse range of plant and animal life that supports the ecosystem. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack lives in the tropics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack's residence produces a lot of sugarcane. (B) He would not be infected with any virus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He would not be infected with any virus.\nExplanation: Living in the tropics does not necessarily mean that Jack's residence produces a lot of sugarcane. However, it is true that living in the tropics can provide some protection against certain viruses, as some viruses cannot survive in the hot and humid conditions found in tropical regions. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "People used umbrella to resist sleet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People to carry mainframe computers with smaller size to work. (B) Snowflakes fell down in the humid weather.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Sleet is a type of precipitation that occurs when snowflakes partially melt as they fall through a layer of warm air and then refreeze as they pass through a layer of cold air near the ground. This results in small ice pellets that can be painful when they hit the skin. Umbrellas can be used to protect oneself from sleet, as well as rain. Therefore, the cause of people using umbrellas to resist sleet is the occurrence of snowflakes falling down in humid weather, which leads to the formation of sleet. Choice (A) is not related to the use of umbrellas to resist sleet."}}
{"Q": "The hippo won. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Most animals need to mate. (B) The hippo and the breeder in the zoo are chasing a ball.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The cause of the hippo winning is likely due to the scenario described in option (B), where the hippo and the breeder in the zoo are chasing a ball. Option (A) about animals needing to mate is not relevant to the given information and does not provide a logical explanation for the hippo winning."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to a drama show last night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He won the first prize in the competition. (B) Tom went home after the stops.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tom went home after the stops.\nExplanation: The given information only states that Tom went to a drama show, but it does not suggest that he participated in any competition or won any prize. Therefore, option (A) is unlikely. Option (B) is more plausible as it is a common outcome of attending a show or event - to go home after it ends."}}
{"Q": "There is still vegetation near the stream during the dry periods. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The gardener takes them into consideration. (B) The stream keeps flowing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The stream keeps flowing.\nExplanation: The presence of vegetation near the stream during dry periods indicates that the plants are able to access water from the stream, which means that the stream is still flowing even during dry periods. This is important for the ecosystem as it provides a source of water for plants and animals that depend on the stream. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not necessarily related to the presence of vegetation near the stream during dry periods."}}
{"Q": "My companion were tired. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They returned home. (B) His wife gave assistanc to him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They returned home.\nExplanation: If the companions were tired, it is likely that they would want to rest and relax. Therefore, the most plausible answer would be that they returned home to rest. Option B, where his wife gave assistance, is not as likely as it is not specified whether the companion is married or has a wife."}}
{"Q": "Light can be relax. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists show this is Alpha. (B) He can't eat too much.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the choices are plausible or related to the statement. \nExplanation: The statement \"Light can be relax\" does not make sense grammatically or scientifically. Therefore, neither choice (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The farmer's wheat got enough nutritions. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got some viable seeds. (B) The production was of good quality.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The production was of good quality.\nExplanation: When the farmer's wheat gets enough nutrition, it will grow well and produce good quality wheat. The nutrients help the wheat to develop strong roots, healthy leaves, and a sturdy stem, which are all essential for a good harvest. Therefore, the production will be of good quality. While viable seeds are also important, they are not necessarily a direct result of the wheat getting enough nutrition."}}
{"Q": "Jack put the quilt in the sun to dry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The quilt is warm. (B) The quilt is dirty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The quilt is warm.\nExplanation: When Jack put the quilt in the sun, it would have absorbed the heat from the sun and become warm. It would not have become dirty unless it was placed on a dirty surface or exposed to dirt or dust in the air. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The witch was not allowed to enter indigenous women's sites. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She often deals with their delirium. (B) She had no place to practise rituals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: As the witch was not allowed to enter indigenous women's sites, she would have had no place to practise rituals that were specific to those sites. This would have limited her ability to perform certain rituals and connect with certain spiritual energies. It is unlikely that she would often deal with their delirium as a result of this restriction."}}
{"Q": "Lucy took good care of her baby carefully. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her baby was healthy when she grew up. (B) He was gradually woken up to life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her baby was healthy when she grew up.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Lucy took good care of her baby carefully, which implies that she was attentive and responsible in ensuring the well-being of her child. As a result, it is more plausible that her baby would grow up to be healthy rather than gradually waking up to life, which is a vague and unclear outcome. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "The angel controls the Kingdom of Heaven. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dominion is part of his responsibility. (B) She has the duty to conduct ceremonies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Dominion is part of his responsibility.\nExplanation: The word \"controls\" implies that the angel has authority and power over the Kingdom of Heaven. As such, it is more likely that the angel's responsibility includes dominion over the Kingdom rather than conducting ceremonies, which is a more ceremonial duty."}}
{"Q": "The doctor found that the number of red pigment hemoglobins was too high. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom drew some blood to check his body. (B) The patient showed symptoms of natriuresis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The presence of a high number of red pigment hemoglobins is likely due to the patient showing symptoms of natriuresis, which is the excretion of sodium in the urine. This can lead to dehydration and an increase in the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood. Drawing blood for a check-up would not directly cause an increase in red pigment hemoglobins."}}
{"Q": "Why do songbirds migrate at night? What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is safer for them. (B) It is harder for them to resist the cold in winter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) It is safer for them.\nExplanation: Songbirds migrate at night because it is safer for them. During the day, they are more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and eagles. By migrating at night, they can avoid these predators and also take advantage of cooler temperatures and calmer winds. Additionally, the stars and moon provide navigation cues for the birds, making it easier for them to find their way."}}
{"Q": "The government decided to pump sea water and replace hem in the canal. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists study the effect of inductions on oxygen uptake by plants. (B) The canal was lack of water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the canal was lack of water, as pumping sea water into the canal would help to replenish the water levels. Choice A, about studying the effect of inductions on oxygen uptake by plants, does not seem to be related to the need to pump sea water into the canal."}}
{"Q": "He took in more zinc. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wants to have more muscles. (B) Jerry wants his urinary system to be healthy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Zinc is known to support a healthy immune system and promote wound healing, but it is also important for maintaining a healthy urinary system. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jerry took in more zinc to support his urinary system rather than to build more muscles."}}
{"Q": "He will not be messed up with love. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The master has no lust. (B) Tom has a good conscience.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The master has no lust.\nExplanation: The statement implies that the person in question will not be affected by love, which suggests that he has no romantic or sexual desires. Option A, which states that the master has no lust, is a more plausible answer as it directly addresses the lack of romantic or sexual desires. Option B, which states that Tom has a good conscience, does not directly relate to the issue of being messed up with love."}}
{"Q": "White recommended that the experimenters study the chromosome traits of voles. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The lab wants to study elephants. (B) The laboratory was asked to study special chromosome traits.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The passage states that White recommended studying the chromosome traits of voles because the laboratory was asked to study special chromosome traits. There is no mention of the lab wanting to study elephants, making choice A incorrect."}}
{"Q": "The vegetations in our garden was out of control. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many germinating seedlings were killed. (B) We bought herbicides to deal with this problem.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: If the vegetation in the garden was out of control, it is more likely that the solution would be to buy herbicides to deal with the problem rather than killing germinating seedlings. Herbicides are designed to kill unwanted plants and are a common solution for controlling overgrown vegetation. Killing germinating seedlings would not necessarily solve the problem of overgrown vegetation and could potentially harm desired plants in the garden."}}
{"Q": "Tom has bought a brightness can. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can see the path clearly at night. (B) The brightness can can be bought in the shop.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He can see the path clearly at night.\nExplanation: Since Tom has bought a brightness can, it is likely that he can use it to illuminate his surroundings and see the path clearly at night. Option B is not a plausible answer as it only states that the brightness can can be bought in a shop, which does not provide any information about what happened as a result of Tom buying it."}}
{"Q": "Mary poured leonardite into a glass of alkali. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The remaining fraction of leonadite is humin. (B) The aquatic plants in the sea are thriving.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The remaining fraction of leonardite is humin.\nExplanation: Leonardite is a type of coal-like substance that is rich in humic acid. When it is mixed with an alkali, the humic acid reacts with the base to form humate salts. The remaining fraction of leonardite after this reaction is humin, which is a dark, insoluble substance that is often used as a soil conditioner. Therefore, it is more plausible that the remaining fraction of leonardite is humin rather than the aquatic plants in the sea thriving as a result of the mixture."}}
{"Q": "John became the new leader of the apostolic church. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His goal of evangelism became firmer. (B) He will be a leading figure for future.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: As the new leader of the apostolic church, John's goal of evangelism became firmer. This is because as a leader, he would have a greater responsibility to spread the message of the church and bring more people into the faith. Additionally, being in a leadership position would give him more opportunities to evangelize and inspire others to do the same. While it is possible that John could become a leading figure for the future, this is not necessarily a direct result of becoming the leader of the apostolic church."}}
{"Q": "I am responsible for the health management of my child. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I need to plan for his vaccinations. (B) She is an expert in treating children from birth to teens.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I need to plan for his vaccinations.\nExplanation: As the responsible person for the health management of a child, it is important to ensure that the child receives all necessary vaccinations to protect them from preventable diseases. Planning for vaccinations is a crucial part of this responsibility. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not directly relate to the responsibility of health management for a child."}}
{"Q": "Scientists found that ptarmigans have different colors in different seasons. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They observe white ptarmigans in winter, but brown ptarmigans in summer. (B) He found that they came in two types.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Scientists observed that ptarmigans have different colors in different seasons, with white feathers in winter and brown feathers in summer. This is due to their natural adaptation to their environment, as the white feathers help them blend in with the snow in winter while the brown feathers help them blend in with the ground in summer. Therefore, choice A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John is an orphan. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has no parents. (B) All anions can enter into the complexes at the same time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He has no parents.\nExplanation: The statement \"John is an orphan\" means that John has lost both of his parents, either through death or abandonment. As a result, he does not have any parents to take care of him or provide for him. This is a common understanding of what it means to be an orphan. Choice B, on the other hand, is unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "The school provides nutritious meals for students. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They harvest a lot of grains every year. (B) Students can eat a lot of fruits and vegetables every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Students can eat a lot of fruits and vegetables every day.\nExplanation: Providing nutritious meals for students would mean that the school is offering a balanced diet that includes fruits and vegetables. As a result, students would have access to these healthy food options every day, which would promote their overall health and well-being. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not directly relate to the provision of nutritious meals for students."}}
{"Q": "The doctor gave him some medicine containing papain. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam suffered from constipation. (B) There is some intercellular matrix of cartilage.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Papain is an enzyme found in papaya that can break down proteins. It is commonly used in medicine as a digestive aid and to reduce inflammation. One of its uses is to break down the intercellular matrix of cartilage, which can be helpful in treating conditions such as osteoarthritis. Therefore, it is more likely that the medicine containing papain was given to treat a condition related to cartilage rather than constipation."}}
{"Q": "He needs to eat foods that are naturally high in nutrition when he is sick. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor encourages Tom to eat more raspberries. (B) His mother made lentils for him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer because lentils are a good source of nutrition and are often recommended for people who are sick. While raspberries are also a nutritious food, it is less likely that a doctor would specifically recommend them for someone who is sick. Additionally, the sentence mentions \"foods that are naturally high in nutrition,\" which suggests a broader range of options beyond just one type of fruit. Therefore, option B is a more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "Tom helps Lucy in studying English. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They could not make food for themselves. (B) Lucy gained a great success in the English examination.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lucy gained success in the English examination as a result of Tom's help in studying English. There is no indication or logical connection between studying English and not being able to make food for themselves."}}
{"Q": "Tom will choose nanotubes over steel. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is looking for some strong materials. (B) Tom thought duchesses had beautiful features.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom is looking for some strong materials.\nExplanation: The statement clearly states that Tom will choose nanotubes over steel, implying that he has a preference for strong materials. Option B about duchesses having beautiful features is irrelevant and does not provide a logical reason for Tom's choice. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The researcher found that it was cobalt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The little boy digged out a lot of smalite. (B) The little boy digged out a bottle of liquid.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The little boy digged out a lot of smalite.\nExplanation: Smalite is a mineral that contains cobalt. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cobalt was found in the smalite that the little boy dug out, rather than in a bottle of liquid."}}
{"Q": "His mucus is decreasing. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He ate a lot of vinegared dishes before driving. (B) Tom often eats pineapples.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Pineapples contain an enzyme called bromelain which has been shown to have mucolytic properties, meaning it can break down and reduce mucus in the body. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's decreased mucus is due to his frequent consumption of pineapples rather than eating vinegared dishes before driving."}}
{"Q": "Joy raises a bluebird in her yard. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She needs to provide dead bugs everyday. (B) The sun exploded soon after.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Bluebirds are insectivores, meaning they primarily eat insects. Therefore, Joy would need to provide dead bugs for the bluebird to eat in order to keep it healthy and alive. Option B is not a plausible answer as the sun exploding would have catastrophic consequences for the entire planet, not just Joy and her bluebird."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said it was meningiomas. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has had a bad digestion recently. (B) Test revealed a something growing on his brain coverings.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The doctor's statement indicates that the cause of Tom's condition is the growth of meningiomas on his brain coverings, as revealed by the test. Option A, which suggests a problem with digestion, is not related to the diagnosis of meningiomas."}}
{"Q": "Lila was beaned by an apple falling from the tree. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lila was sitting under an apple tree. (B) The temperature dropped below zero degrees Celsius.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lila was sitting under an apple tree.\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer because apples grow on trees and it is common for them to fall off when they are ripe or due to wind. Lila being under the apple tree increases the likelihood of her being hit by a falling apple. The temperature dropping below zero degrees Celsius has no direct correlation to Lila being hit by an apple."}}
{"Q": "John compared Iridium with platinum. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) H e found both are white but Iridium has a slight yellowish cast. (B) His friend recommended naphthalene to him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The question states that John compared Iridium with platinum, so it is likely that he was comparing their physical properties. Choice A provides a plausible answer by stating that John found both to be white, but noticed a slight yellowish cast in Iridium. This suggests that John was able to distinguish between the two metals and noticed a difference in their appearance. Choice B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the comparison of Iridium and platinum and does not provide a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He can't control his passage of stool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was exposed to cadmiums. (B) Tom has been heavily crashed down by a car.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tom's inability to control his bowel movements is due to the trauma he experienced from being hit by a car. This type of injury can cause damage to the nerves and muscles that control bowel movements. Exposure to cadmiums may cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but it is not a common cause of fecal incontinence."}}
{"Q": "The doctor says it is impossible to become malignant. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) No energy is available for the dying plant anymore. (B) He is worried about his fibroadenomas will become malignant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The doctor's concern about his fibroadenomas becoming malignant suggests that the question is related to a medical condition. Option A, about a dying plant, is not relevant to the context. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The seller had grown these breeds for a long time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He would sell the mature breeds. (B) He knew how they looked like.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since the seller had grown these breeds for a long time, it is likely that he would sell the mature breeds as they would be ready for sale. Option B is not as plausible as it is common for breeders to know how their breeds look like regardless of how long they have been growing them."}}
{"Q": "Scientists observe hemispheres. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists have observed the aurora. (B) Scientists have observed the jet streams.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Scientists have observed the jet streams.\nExplanation: By observing the hemispheres, scientists can study the patterns and movements of the jet streams, which are high-altitude winds that play a significant role in weather patterns. The observation of auroras may also be related to the study of hemispheres, but it is not directly mentioned in the question."}}
{"Q": "I cannot take new Photos now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Something is wrong with my camera flash. (B) Something is matched with my camera flash.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Something is wrong with my camera flash.\nExplanation: If something is wrong with the camera flash, it may not work properly and prevent new photos from being taken. On the other hand, if something is matched with the camera flash, it is unclear what that means and how it would prevent new photos from being taken. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "In ancient times, ministers would write to the emperor and put forward their precious opinions for solving national issues. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He moved to their environment. (B) The emperor can solve problems for the people thoroughly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that ministers would write to the emperor with their opinions for solving national issues. Therefore, it is more plausible that the emperor would use these opinions to solve problems for the people thoroughly rather than moving to their environment."}}
{"Q": "It looks like rain outside. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom brings an umbrella. (B) After a while rain fell down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom brings an umbrella.\nExplanation: The statement \"It looks like rain outside\" implies that it hasn't started raining yet, but there are signs that it might. Therefore, it would be more plausible for someone to prepare for the possibility of rain by bringing an umbrella, rather than for rain to have already fallen down."}}
{"Q": "The earth's environment is getting worse every day. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Humanity have gradually appeared on the earth. (B) Too much greenhouse gases were harmful to the environment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The excessive emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, has been identified as the primary cause of global warming and climate change. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to renewable energy sources are crucial steps to mitigate the environmental damage."}}
{"Q": "They found a lot food. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The hunter caught a lot of squirrels. (B) They are the first settlers on this island.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions finding a lot of food, which suggests that the food was obtained through hunting or gathering. Option A provides a specific and plausible explanation for the abundance of food, as catching a lot of squirrels would certainly contribute to a large food supply. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear explanation for the food and is less likely to be the cause."}}
{"Q": "White tails are very striking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cottontails are always caught by eagles. (B) The most impressed was the beautiful but different heads they have.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The most impressed was the beautiful but different heads they have.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the statement about white tails being striking. It makes sense that someone would be impressed by the beauty and uniqueness of the heads of white-tailed animals. Choice (A) is not related to the statement and seems like a random fact, making it an unlikely answer."}}
{"Q": "Mumps virus is rampant in kindergartens. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jennifer unluckily develops mumps. (B) She lost the ability of nursing her baby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jennifer unluckily develops mumps.\nExplanation: Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection that spreads through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. Kindergartens are a common place for the virus to spread due to close contact between children. If Jennifer is exposed to the virus, she may contract mumps and experience symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and swollen salivary glands. Losing the ability to nurse her baby is not a common complication of mumps."}}
{"Q": "The machine has some functions similar to the human minds. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They get along well with each other. (B) It can identify some obvious patterns.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the machine has some functions similar to the human mind, which implies that it can identify patterns like humans do. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A is not necessarily true as the statement does not provide any information about the machine's ability to get along with humans."}}
{"Q": "He bled heavily during the operation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His family thinks he can heal himself. (B) He is in urgent need of a blood transfusion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If someone bleeds heavily during an operation, it is likely that they have lost a significant amount of blood and require a blood transfusion to replace the lost blood and prevent further complications such as organ damage or even death. It is unlikely that his family would think he can heal himself in such a situation."}}
{"Q": "Dad planted some trees for her. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She needed a shelter. (B) Lily likes to eat small red fruit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Lily likes to eat small red fruit suggests that the trees were planted to provide her with a source of food. It is unlikely that the trees were planted solely for shelter, as there are many other ways to provide shelter that do not involve planting trees."}}
{"Q": "They have a spine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are blackbucks in the zoo. (B) Humans are vertebrates.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Humans are vertebrates, which means they have a spine. Blackbucks being in the zoo is not relevant to the fact that humans have a spine."}}
{"Q": "He had a serious headache. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was filled with heavy pressure because of the exam. (B) The helmsman was steering the ship.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The given information suggests that Tom had a serious headache, which is often caused by stress and pressure. Option A states that Tom was under heavy pressure due to an exam, which is a plausible cause for a headache. Option B, on the other hand, mentions a helmsman steering a ship, which is not related to the given information and therefore an unlikely cause for Tom's headache."}}
{"Q": "The cow's yield is three versus one. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom killed a lamb and got 100 kgs of mutton and 200 kgs of fat. (B) Tom killed a cow and got 300 kgs of beef and 100 kgs of fat from the carcass.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The question is about the yield of a cow, so option (B) is more plausible as it involves a cow being killed and yielding 300 kgs of beef. Option (A) involves a lamb being killed and does not mention anything about a cow, making it an unlikely cause for the difference in yield between the two cows mentioned in the question."}}
{"Q": "It has been fifteen years since the wine is bottled. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The byproduct in it should be analyzed. (B) The bottle aging of the wine is fifteen years.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the wine has been aged in the bottle for fifteen years, which is a common practice for certain types of wine. It does not necessarily imply that there is a byproduct that needs to be analyzed."}}
{"Q": "John's thyroid couldn't take in iodinein salt as usual. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The velocity of the car was too high. (B) John took in some thiocyanate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Thiocyanate is known to inhibit the uptake of iodine by the thyroid gland, leading to decreased production of thyroid hormones. This can result in hypothyroidism, which may cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The velocity of a car has no relation to thyroid function, making option A an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They are extremely cautious only during drought periods. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The guards are responsible of preventing wildfire for the forest. (B) They are trappers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the guards are responsible for preventing wildfires in the forest during drought periods. This would explain why they are extremely cautious during these times, as the risk of a fire starting and spreading is much higher. Trappers would not necessarily have a reason to be more cautious during drought periods, as their trapping methods would likely remain the same regardless of weather conditions."}}
{"Q": "Only this country has appropriate climate for this plant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many workers are toxicated. (B) This plant is only distributed here.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This plant is only distributed here.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the plant requires a specific climate to grow, and only one country has that climate. Therefore, it is likely that the plant is only found and distributed in that country. Option (A) about workers being toxicated is not related to the information given about the plant and its climate."}}
{"Q": "There are more bryophytes distributed here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are some vascular plants growing here. (B) The temperature has risen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There are some vascular plants growing here.\nExplanation: Bryophytes are often found in areas with low competition from other plants, as they are not able to compete well with vascular plants. Therefore, the presence of vascular plants in an area can indicate that there is less competition for resources, allowing bryophytes to thrive. The temperature rising may also have an effect on bryophyte distribution, but the presence of vascular plants is a more likely explanation."}}
{"Q": "Mary has two pieces of farmland, but only one of them is used to grow crops every year. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The often used farmland produces a lot more crops than the less often used one. (B) The less often used farmland produces more crops than the often used one.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: It is likely that the often used farmland produces a lot more crops than the less often used one because it is being regularly maintained and cultivated. The soil is likely to be more fertile and the crops are likely to be healthier due to consistent care and attention."}}
{"Q": "He can't control his stool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He's incontinent. (B) He's hypoglycemic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He's incontinent.\nExplanation: Incontinence refers to the inability to control bowel movements, which can result from a variety of medical conditions such as nerve damage, muscle weakness, or certain medications. Hypoglycemia, on the other hand, is a condition where blood sugar levels drop too low and can cause symptoms such as shakiness, confusion, and sweating, but it does not typically cause loss of bowel control. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer in this case."}}
{"Q": "The experimenter intends to adjust the ionic bond. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cooperation should be enhanced. (B) The experimenters wanted to turn oxygen into an electron recipient.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Ionic bonds involve the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of ions with opposite charges that are held together by electrostatic attraction. In order to adjust the ionic bond, the experimenter would need to manipulate the electron transfer process. One way to do this would be to change the properties of the atoms involved, such as making oxygen more likely to accept electrons. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A, on the other hand, does not relate to the concept of ionic bonding and is not a likely reason for adjusting the bond."}}
{"Q": "Long-chaine polymer molecules are elastic and attrition resistant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Esters can be processed in chemical reactions. (B) Rubber is elastic and attrition resistant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the properties of long-chain polymer molecules include elasticity and attrition resistance. Rubber is a well-known example of a material that possesses these properties, making option B the more plausible answer. Option A, on the other hand, is not directly related to the given statement and does not provide a clear explanation for the properties of long-chain polymer molecules."}}
{"Q": "Tomatoes grow slowly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This place is warm and humid. (B) Plant tomatoes in a cold place.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Plant tomatoes in a cold place.\nExplanation: Tomatoes are warm-season plants and require warm temperatures to grow properly. Planting them in a cold place will slow down their growth and development. Warm and humid conditions, as mentioned in choice (A), are actually ideal for tomato growth and would not be the cause of slow growth."}}
{"Q": "James died from explosion of millions of cells. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) James had smallpox. (B) James was infected by hepatitis b virus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Smallpox is a highly contagious viral disease that can cause the explosion of millions of cells in the body, leading to death. Hepatitis B virus, on the other hand, primarily affects the liver and does not typically cause widespread cell destruction. Therefore, smallpox is a more plausible cause of James's death in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "I find some seaweed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to drink some water. (B) I come to the Australian coastal water to have fun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I come to the Australian coastal water to have fun.\nExplanation: Seaweed is a natural occurrence in coastal waters and is often found washed up on beaches. It is unlikely that Tom wanting to drink water would cause seaweed to appear. On the other hand, if someone is visiting the Australian coastal water for recreational purposes such as swimming or surfing, it is common to come across seaweed. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "These grapes got fermentation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She sealed these grapes in the bottle. (B) She put these grape on the table.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She sealed these grapes in the bottle.\nExplanation: Fermentation occurs when yeast or bacteria consume the sugars in grapes and produce alcohol and carbon dioxide. By sealing the grapes in a bottle, the yeast or bacteria are trapped inside with the sugars, allowing fermentation to occur. Leaving the grapes on a table would not necessarily lead to fermentation as the yeast or bacteria needed for the process may not be present in the environment."}}
{"Q": "Dogs have sharp teeth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They open their jaws when they encounter tough bones. (B) The skeleton shows that their teeth are very special.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Dogs have sharp teeth to help them tear and chew through meat and bones. When they encounter tough bones, they open their jaws wide to get a better grip and use their sharp teeth to break through the bone. The shape and structure of their skeleton may also contribute to their ability to use their teeth effectively, but it is not directly related to the sharpness of their teeth. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They grow new leaves in spring. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He grows many canes. (B) The gardener was hired to take care of my poinsettias.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The growth of new leaves in spring is a natural process for many plants, including poinsettias. Choice A suggests that the plant has many canes, which could indicate a healthy and robust plant that is capable of producing new growth. Choice B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the growth of new leaves and does not provide a plausible explanation."}}
{"Q": "The judge held that he had committed a crime for his action and sentenced him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The general's surrender was regarded as an shameful action. (B) Bob argued to the judge that he had no intention of killing though he put a knife around the victims's neck.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence \"The general's surrender was regarded as a shameful action\" suggests that Bob's action was related to the general's surrender. It is possible that Bob believed the general's surrender was dishonorable and took matters into his own hands, leading to his crime and subsequent sentencing by the judge. Choice B is not a plausible answer as putting a knife around someone's neck is a clear act of violence and intent to harm, regardless of whether or not the intention was to kill."}}
{"Q": "He suckled it via intuition. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The infant was provided with a nipple. (B) Tony did not know the meaning of love.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The infant was provided with a nipple.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the infant was able to breastfeed through Tony's intuition, which implies that the infant was provided with a nipple. It is a natural instinct for babies to suckle when they are hungry, and if they are provided with a nipple, they will do so without any external guidance. The second option, that Tony did not know the meaning of love, is not related to the sentence and does not provide a plausible explanation for the situation described."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought clothes in the same shop again. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is fashion. (B) The clthes are in different styles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Tom bought clothes in the same shop again does not necessarily mean that he is fashionable. Option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the clothes he bought may be in different styles, indicating that he has a diverse taste in fashion."}}
{"Q": "Mike's father was doing rehabilitation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It shows that Mike's father achieved the maximum functional potential after the process. (B) Mike's father had a worse condition after the process.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Rehabilitation is a process that aims to improve a person's physical, mental, and functional abilities after an illness or injury. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mike's father achieved the maximum functional potential after the rehabilitation process. Option B is less likely as it goes against the purpose of rehabilitation."}}
{"Q": "Black ink in Jack's pen went out. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can't write with this pen. (B) He also found that deflation had set in.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: When the black ink in Jack's pen went out, he can't write with this pen anymore. Option B, which mentions deflation, is not related to the situation and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom's rabbits are dead. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom feeds his rabbits carrots. (B) Tom's rabbits have hairballs in their stomaches.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: While feeding rabbits carrots is a common misconception, it is not actually harmful to them. However, hairballs in their stomachs can be a serious issue and can lead to digestive problems and even death. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's rabbits died due to hairballs in their stomachs rather than from eating carrots."}}
{"Q": "Merchants built cabins in the mountains to facilitate trade. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These cabins are now historic buildings. (B) There was no phosphate precipitation of iron.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. These cabins are now historic buildings.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that merchants built cabins in the mountains to facilitate trade. As time passed, these cabins became a part of history and are now considered historic buildings. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, is irrelevant to the given statement and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "I am a good dancer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I feel energetic. (B) I have rotational inertia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Dancing is a physical activity that requires movement and coordination, which can increase blood flow and release endorphins, leading to a feeling of energy and positivity. Therefore, feeling energetic is a more plausible result of being a good dancer than having rotational inertia, which is a property of objects in motion and not related to personal abilities or feelings."}}
{"Q": "Vaccines brought circulating defense agent against the disease for his immune system. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Vaccines activiated antobodies in Tom's body. (B) One patient was so sick that he had repeated infections.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Vaccines work by introducing a small, harmless piece of the virus or bacteria into the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against it. These antibodies then circulate in the body and are ready to fight off the actual virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to it in the future. Therefore, vaccines activate antibodies in the body, making option A the more plausible answer. Option B is not related to how vaccines work."}}
{"Q": "The students was majoring in optics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He studies a lt about  the dispersion of light. (B) He has been the best student in the class with the highest skill level.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If the student is majoring in optics, it is more plausible that he would study a lot about the dispersion of light, as this is a fundamental concept in the field. It is not necessarily true that he would be the best student in the class or have the highest skill level, as this would depend on individual abilities and effort."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a persistent abdominal pain. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom swallowed a large amount of laxative by mistake. (B) The bananas Tom bought are a bit underripe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Abdominal pain is a common symptom of indigestion, which can be caused by eating underripe bananas. Swallowing a large amount of laxative by mistake may cause abdominal pain, but it is less likely to be persistent."}}
{"Q": "Tom is very envious of the job as jailers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He often has fatigue in his eyes. (B) They only need to guard prisoners every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tom is envious of the job as jailers, it means he wants to have that job. Therefore, option B is more plausible as it describes the job duties of a jailer, which Tom may find desirable. Option A, on the other hand, does not seem to be related to Tom's envy of the job as jailers."}}
{"Q": "Mary was diagnosed with lymphopenia yesterday. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary gets many images. (B) Her immune system has weakened since last month.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Her immune system has weakened since last month.\nExplanation: Lymphopenia is a condition where the body has a low level of lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system. A weakened immune system is a common result of lymphopenia, making the body more susceptible to infections and diseases. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) is not related to lymphopenia and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "He is looking for bowls. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mario feels thirsty. (B) Mario feels hungry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Mario is looking for bowls, it is more likely that he is feeling hungry and looking to eat something that requires a bowl, such as soup or cereal. Thirst would not necessarily require a bowl, as he could simply drink from a glass or bottle."}}
{"Q": "Ozone has drastically reduced. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Humans produce lots of halons today. (B) Tom has ate some medicines containing antimetabolites.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Ozone depletion is primarily caused by the release of human-made chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, which break down ozone molecules in the stratosphere. While Tom's consumption of medicines containing antimetabolites may have negative health effects, it is not a direct cause of ozone depletion."}}
{"Q": "He got some rum. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He went to a cllege. (B) The worker fremented some sugar cane with yeast.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The worker fermented some sugar cane with yeast.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it directly explains the process of making rum. Rum is made by fermenting sugar cane with yeast, which produces alcohol. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of him getting rum was due to the worker fermenting sugar cane with yeast. Going to college does not necessarily have any direct correlation with obtaining rum."}}
{"Q": "The porridge became hot. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Peter put hydrochloric acid into the solution. (B) Tom put his porridge into the microwave oven.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom put his porridge into the microwave oven, which caused it to become hot. Option A, which suggests that Peter put hydrochloric acid into the solution, is not a likely cause for the porridge becoming hot as hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can cause a chemical reaction, but it is not typically used in cooking. Therefore, option B is the most reasonable explanation."}}
{"Q": "The man drove to the park. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He saw one hump in dromedaries and two humps in camels. (B) He parked his car in the park.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He parked his car in the park.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the action in the sentence. The sentence states that the man drove to the park, so it makes sense that the result would be that he parked his car there. Option A, on the other hand, is unrelated to the sentence and seems like a random fact."}}
{"Q": "There are a lot of children here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This is a rich area. (B) It is sunny outside.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement \"there are a lot of children here\" does not necessarily indicate that the area is rich. However, the fact that it is sunny outside could be a plausible explanation for why there are a lot of children present. Children are more likely to be outside and playing when the weather is nice, which could explain their presence in the area."}}
{"Q": "Tom's whole lungs have shadows. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor asked Tom to do a pneumonectomy. (B) When he went to the hospital to do physical examination, his lung has been filled with shadow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The doctor asked Tom to do a pneumonectomy.\nExplanation: If Tom's whole lungs have shadows, it could indicate a serious condition such as lung cancer or tuberculosis. In such cases, a pneumonectomy (surgical removal of a lung) may be necessary to prevent the spread of the disease and save the patient's life. Option B does not provide a clear explanation of what happened to Tom or what his condition is, so it is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Many pirates were attracted for the piratical chests. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The secret of bales were hidden in the prince's room. (B) Their group of pirates often roam this part of the sea.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The secret of bales refers to the treasure chests filled with valuable goods and treasures that were often hidden by wealthy merchants or rulers. Pirates were attracted to these chests because they could potentially contain a large amount of wealth and riches. Option B does not provide a clear reason for why pirates would be attracted to piratical chests specifically."}}
{"Q": "Three american families wil benefit from it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alcoholism is encouraged. (B) A ban was imposed on alcoholism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: A ban on alcoholism would lead to a decrease in alcohol consumption, which could potentially benefit families affected by alcoholism. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A, on the other hand, would have a negative impact on families affected by alcoholism."}}
{"Q": "The zipper almost blends in with the skirt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has bought a Geese brand down jacket. (B) Emily likes this skirt very much.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the zipper almost blending in with the skirt is likely due to the design and color choice of the skirt, which Emily likes very much. It is unlikely that the purchase of a down jacket by Tom would have any effect on the zipper blending in with the skirt."}}
{"Q": "The flower didn't grow well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The gardener implant the flower into another place. (B) This flower's carpel was damaged.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This flower's carpel was damaged.\nExplanation: The carpel is an essential part of a flower's reproductive system, and if it is damaged, the flower may not grow properly or produce seeds. Therefore, it is more plausible that the damaged carpel was the cause of the flower not growing well rather than the gardener transplanting it to another location."}}
{"Q": "He used aoudad as an example to show the students. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob realizes the importance of learning. (B) The biology teacher said that many creatures have a strong ability to adapt to the environment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The use of aoudad as an example suggests that the biology teacher had mentioned the ability of creatures to adapt to their environment, and Bob was using this example to further illustrate the point to the students."}}
{"Q": "The cardamoms got dried and died when he came back. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim lost his pause this morning. (B) Mario didn't add water to the cardamoms when he was on business.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Mario didn't add water to the cardamoms when he was on business.\nExplanation: Cardamoms require a certain level of moisture to stay fresh and alive. If they are not watered regularly, they can dry out and die. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the cardamoms drying out and dying was due to the lack of water, rather than Jim losing his pause."}}
{"Q": "Many vesicles appear on his back and arms. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jasin gets affected by acute dermatitis. (B) Jack jumped out of the plane.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The appearance of vesicles on the back and arms is a common symptom of acute dermatitis, which is an inflammation of the skin caused by an allergic reaction or irritant. Jumping out of a plane would not cause vesicles to appear on the skin."}}
{"Q": "No chemical in the environment can enter his body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The alien has access to water, air  and dust. (B) Tom always has convulsions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement implies that the alien has some sort of protective barrier or mechanism that prevents chemicals from entering its body. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as a specialized skin or membrane, or a unique respiratory or digestive system. Option B, which suggests that Tom always has convulsions, is not related to the given statement and therefore cannot be the cause of the alien's resistance to environmental chemicals."}}
{"Q": "White seemed to be selfish. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) White took all useful tools alone. (B) Tom was at a loss about his future.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that White took all useful tools alone suggests that he was only thinking about himself and not considering the needs of others. This behavior is indicative of selfishness. On the other hand, there is no evidence to suggest that Tom's uncertainty about his future had any direct impact on White's behavior. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Quantitative values are needed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The students calculated the sum of the squares of the differences between each statistic and their average and divided it by the number of statistics. (B) We must understand the mathematics.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement indicates that quantitative values are needed, which suggests that some sort of calculation or mathematical analysis is required. Option A provides a specific formula for calculating a value based on the differences between statistics and their average, which is a plausible explanation for what happened as a result. Option B does not provide any specific information or explanation, and simply suggests that understanding mathematics is important, which is not directly relevant to the question."}}
{"Q": "It damaged his heart on many different parts. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has a lung problem. (B) He was caught by a disease.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He was caught by a disease.\nExplanation: A disease is more likely to cause damage to multiple parts of the heart than a lung problem. Lung problems may affect the respiratory system, but they are not directly linked to heart damage. On the other hand, there are many diseases that can cause damage to the heart, such as coronary artery disease, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This substance cannot pass through the bronchi. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This substance cannot pass through the bronchioles. (B) This substance cannot enter the lungs through breathing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If a substance cannot pass through the bronchi, it means it cannot enter the lungs through breathing. The bronchi are the main airways that lead to the lungs, so if a substance cannot pass through them, it cannot reach the lungs. The bronchioles are smaller airways within the lungs, so choice A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Students observe the cytoplasm in biology class. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The students see the organelles. (B) Biology students have observed smooth muscle and less elastic tissue.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The students see the organelles.\nExplanation: When observing the cytoplasm, students would be able to see the organelles within the cell, such as the mitochondria, ribosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum. Option B, which mentions smooth muscle and elastic tissue, is not related to observing the cytoplasm and seems out of context."}}
{"Q": "Only the queens are able to lay eggs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many bees are infertile. (B) Other bees have no reproductive organs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The cause of only queens being able to lay eggs is because other bees, including worker bees and drones, do not have fully developed reproductive organs. Worker bees have ovaries but they are not fully developed and they do not mate, while drones only have reproductive organs for mating and do not have the ability to lay eggs. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "These jellyfishes lived together. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They died after different years. (B) They thrived with amazing reproduction rate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They thrived with amazing reproduction rate.\nExplanation: Jellyfishes are known to reproduce rapidly and in large numbers. Living together in a group, or a bloom, can increase their chances of survival and reproduction. This is because they can share resources and protect themselves from predators. Therefore, it is more plausible that they thrived with an amazing reproduction rate rather than dying after different years."}}
{"Q": "He can catch hundreds of jin of fish every month. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has eaten a lot of statins. (B) He's the best fisherman around here.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He's the best fisherman around here.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tom's ability to catch a large amount of fish every month is due to his skills and experience as a fisherman rather than the consumption of statins, which are cholesterol-lowering drugs and have no known effect on fishing ability."}}
{"Q": "She has a dominant position in large group. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy is a female bonobo. (B) Lenoes love to be a part of a group.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lucy is a female bonobo.\nExplanation: In bonobo societies, females hold a dominant position in the group. This is due to their social skills and ability to form strong alliances with other females. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy's dominant position is due to her species and gender rather than a generalization about all Lenoes."}}
{"Q": "Dispersal is very common. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A lot of offspring moves away from their parents. (B) The viscosity of the fluid with strong flow is lower than the one of the fluid with weak flow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. A lot of offspring moves away from their parents.\nExplanation: Dispersal refers to the movement of individuals or offspring away from their original location or parent population. This is a common phenomenon in many species and can occur for various reasons such as competition for resources, avoiding inbreeding, or seeking new habitats. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is unrelated to the concept of dispersal and is not a valid explanation."}}
{"Q": "It got gentle yellow feathers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is a little cygnets which is only one-month old. (B) A hummingbird went out for food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It is a little cygnets which is only one-month old.\nExplanation: Young cygnets have yellowish feathers when they are born and for the first few months of their lives. As they grow older, their feathers will gradually turn white. Therefore, it is more plausible that the gentle yellow feathers are due to the cygnet's young age rather than a hummingbird going out for food."}}
{"Q": "Tom and Lucy majoring anatomies are partners. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They always had an argument. (B) They always had a perfect cooperation in the operation process.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Tom and Lucy are both majoring in anatomies, it is likely that they have a good understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses in the field. This would lead to a better cooperation in the operation process, rather than constant arguments. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The fake doctor could only recognize iodine deficiency from the most visible sign. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was certain about the illness of patients with Goiters. (B) People inside faced great inconvenience.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Since the fake doctor could only recognize iodine deficiency from the most visible sign, which is goiter, he may misdiagnose other illnesses that have similar symptoms. This could lead to people receiving incorrect treatment or no treatment at all, causing inconvenience and potentially worsening their condition. Additionally, the fake doctor may not be able to identify iodine deficiency in patients who do not have visible goiters, leading to undiagnosed cases and potential health complications."}}
{"Q": "The biosphere is out of balance. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The number of beavers become rampant. (B) The environment becomes better.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When the biosphere is out of balance, it means that there is an imbalance in the natural systems that make up the Earth's environment. This can lead to negative consequences such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and pollution. However, it is unlikely that the number of beavers would become rampant as a result of this imbalance. Instead, the environment would likely become worse as a result of the imbalance. Therefore, option B, which states that the environment becomes better, is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He wants to rest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is running. (B) Jack eats a very healthy and balanced diet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The cause of him wanting to rest is most likely due to him running, as physical activity can cause fatigue and the need for rest. Jack's healthy diet may contribute to his overall energy levels, but it is not directly related to his desire to rest in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "He wants to go home quickly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is hungry. (B) It's hot outside.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He is hungry.\nExplanation: The fact that he wants to go home quickly suggests that he has a pressing need or desire that can only be fulfilled at home. Being hungry is a more plausible reason for wanting to go home quickly than it being hot outside, as hunger is a basic human need that requires immediate attention. On the other hand, being hot outside may be uncomfortable, but it is not necessarily urgent or pressing enough to warrant a quick return home."}}
{"Q": "Tom tries to stay away from puddles in summer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to dig out some gold out of a permafrost area in summer. (B) Tom hates mosquitoes very much.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Tom tries to stay away from puddles in summer, which is a common breeding ground for mosquitoes. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom hates mosquitoes and wants to avoid getting bitten by them. Option A, which talks about digging out gold from permafrost, is not related to the given statement and seems unlikely."}}
{"Q": "The boy separated two solutions of different concentrations with a membrane. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found cassiterite, carbon and Tin. (B) The osmosis occures.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When two solutions of different concentrations are separated by a membrane, osmosis occurs. This means that water molecules move from the solution with lower concentration to the solution with higher concentration, in an attempt to balance out the concentration on both sides of the membrane. This process continues until the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. The separation of solutions does not result in the discovery of cassiterite, carbon, and tin."}}
{"Q": "He felt fainted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was exposed to the sunshine for a long time in summer. (B) The patient was given a lot of diuretics.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The given information suggests that the person felt fainted, which could be a symptom of dehydration or low blood pressure. Option B states that the patient was given a lot of diuretics, which are medications that increase urine production and can lead to dehydration and low blood pressure. Therefore, option B seems like a more plausible answer than option A, which only mentions exposure to the sun and does not provide any information about dehydration or low blood pressure."}}
{"Q": "The geranium looks vigorous with verdurous leafs and brilliant flowers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa places the geraniums in the bright sunny balcony. . (B) Lisa waters the geranium in the balcony every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The use of the words \"verdurous\" and \"brilliant\" suggest that the geranium is thriving and healthy, which is likely due to receiving ample sunlight on the bright sunny balcony. While watering is important, it alone would not necessarily result in such vibrant growth and blooms."}}
{"Q": "The sperm from one sponge fused with the egg from the other to achive fertilization. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists are studying between which cells the sperm is produced. (B) Both sponges kept in this tank produced eggs and sperms.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that both sponges kept in the same tank produced eggs and sperms, which allowed for fertilization to occur between the two sponges. This is a common occurrence in aquatic environments where multiple organisms are kept in the same tank or body of water. Option A is not relevant to the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "My albatross is pregnant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It needs to be strong enough for the birth of its children. (B) It needs to be fat enough for the birth of its children.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It needs to be fat enough for the birth of its children.\nExplanation: During pregnancy, female albatrosses need to gain enough weight to support the growth and development of their offspring. This weight gain is essential for the successful birth and rearing of their young. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He choked again seriously. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He saw a creature with big mouth and small head. (B) He kind of choked a few seconds ago.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He kind of choked a few seconds ago.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the cause of his choking again is related to his previous choking episode rather than seeing a creature with a big mouth and small head. It is possible that he did not fully recover from his previous choking and still had some food or obstruction in his airway, leading to another choking episode."}}
{"Q": "He will be fine as long as catch a whale. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This orcas seems going to die for hunger. (B) This orcas seems going to die for shooting by the hunters.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the orca will be fine if it catches a whale, implying that the orca is currently experiencing hunger. Option A states that the orca seems to be dying of hunger, which is a more plausible explanation than option B, which suggests that the orca is dying due to being shot by hunters."}}
{"Q": "The floc was finally removed after a night. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sedimentation was used by Stephen to separate substances in solution. (B) Stephen concentrated protein by dialysis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Sedimentation was used by Stephen to separate substances in solution.\nExplanation: Sedimentation is a process of separating substances in a solution based on their density. In this case, the floc was likely made up of larger, denser particles that settled to the bottom of the solution overnight. This is a common method used in water treatment plants to remove impurities from water. Dialysis, on the other hand, is a process of separating substances based on their size and charge, and would not be an effective method for removing floc from a solution. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom suffered from the lung cancer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His blood vessel was heavily blocked. (B) He can't have a deep breath.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Lung cancer can cause difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, and a feeling of tightness in the chest. This is because the cancerous cells can block the airways and reduce the amount of oxygen that can enter the lungs. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not directly related to lung cancer and is more commonly associated with heart disease."}}
{"Q": "His mom was satisfied about his health. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Black's mother said that Black should have a good habit. (B) The child started to drink juices regularly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The child started to drink juices regularly.\nExplanation: Drinking juices regularly can improve one's health, and it is a plausible reason for Black's mother to be satisfied with his health. Choice (A) is not directly related to Black's health, and therefore, it is less likely to be the cause of his mother's satisfaction."}}
{"Q": "Rachel's mother bought her a pot of calyx. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The ermine is hungry. (B) Rachel wants to raise a special green plant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Rachel wants to raise a special green plant, as calyx is a type of plant. There is no indication or logical connection between the ermine being hungry and Rachel's mother buying her a pot of calyx."}}
{"Q": "Amy hates hurricanes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She never touches chemicals like plastics, lubricants, gasoline and so on. (B) She doesn't like summer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She doesn't like summer.\nExplanation: There is no direct correlation between hating hurricanes and avoiding chemicals like plastics, lubricants, and gasoline. However, hurricanes are more likely to occur during the summer months, so it is more plausible that Amy's dislike of hurricanes would lead to her not enjoying summer."}}
{"Q": "Other countries looked up to its position. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) On December 16, 1902, the eruption of Mount Peree in the West Indies shook the world. (B) Rome is a great empire.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The eruption of Mount Pelee in the West Indies on December 16, 1902, was a significant event that caused widespread destruction and loss of life. Despite this tragedy, the way in which the government and people of Martinique responded to the disaster was seen as admirable by other countries. The French government quickly sent aid and resources to the island, and the people of Martinique showed resilience and determination in rebuilding their homes and communities. This response was seen as a model for other countries to follow in times of crisis, which is why other countries looked up to its position. On the other hand, option B is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any specific reason or explanation for why other countries would look up to Rome as a great empire."}}
{"Q": "Tom cuts off all the leaves of an apple tree. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The apple tree stops growing and dies soon. (B) He succeeded.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Cutting off all the leaves of an apple tree will prevent it from photosynthesizing, which is essential for its growth and survival. Without the ability to produce food, the tree will eventually die. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B is not a logical consequence of cutting off all the leaves of an apple tree."}}
{"Q": "Archaeologists have discovered a fossil from Devonian period. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Archaeologists have discovered that poppies were used two thousand years ago. (B) This is a shark fossil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The given information about the discovery of a fossil from the Devonian period is related to prehistoric marine life, which makes option B about a shark fossil more plausible than option A about poppies being used two thousand years ago."}}
{"Q": "The aspens were exposed to pesticides. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have different characteristics. (B) They had responses instantly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They had responses instantly.\nExplanation: Pesticides are chemicals that are used to kill or control pests. When aspens are exposed to pesticides, they may have immediate responses such as wilting, yellowing of leaves, or even death. It is unlikely that they would develop different characteristics as a result of pesticide exposure."}}
{"Q": "There were lots of herring eggbeds here yesterday,. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Today they've been eaten by yellowtail fishing. (B) The eggs are ready to be eaten.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Today they've been eaten by yellowtail fishing.\nExplanation: Herring eggs are a popular food source for many marine animals, including yellowtail fish. It is likely that the herring eggbeds were quickly consumed by yellowtail fishing, leaving none behind for today. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is not likely as herring eggs take several weeks to hatch and are not ready to be eaten immediately after being laid."}}
{"Q": "He can always recommend the right medicine to the patient. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The pharmacist in the drugstore is very professional. (B) Tom is a pharmacist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"he\" which refers to a specific person who can recommend the right medicine to the patient. The cause of this ability is mentioned in choice B, which states that \"Tom is a pharmacist.\" Therefore, it is more plausible that the person being referred to in the sentence is Tom, who has the knowledge and expertise to recommend the right medicine as a pharmacist."}}
{"Q": "Jack suffered from juvenile arthritis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His movement is restricted. (B) He has been suffering from diarrhea recently.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His movement is restricted.\nExplanation: Juvenile arthritis is a condition that causes inflammation in the joints, which can lead to pain, stiffness, and swelling. As a result, it can limit a person's ability to move and perform daily activities. Diarrhea is not a common symptom of juvenile arthritis, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "It started to swim. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I saw a midge. (B) The little guppy first left its mother's body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The little guppy swimming after leaving its mother's body is a more plausible answer as it is a natural behavior for fish to start swimming after being born. Seeing a midge would not necessarily cause a fish to start swimming."}}
{"Q": "The doctor advised him to eat food rich in polyunsaturates. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cholesterol level in his blood is above the normal range. (B) His intake of magnesium has been insufficient for a long time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The cholesterol level in his blood is above the normal range.\nExplanation: Polyunsaturated fats have been shown to help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels in the blood, which can reduce the risk of heart disease. Therefore, if the doctor advised him to eat food rich in polyunsaturates, it is likely that his cholesterol level is above the normal range and needs to be lowered. Magnesium intake is not directly related to the consumption of polyunsaturated fats."}}
{"Q": "Tom's cells began to proliferate uncontrollably. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has lung cancer. (B) Tom's father's blood pressure dropped because of too much blood transfusion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom has lung cancer.\nExplanation: Uncontrolled cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer. Lung cancer is a type of cancer that commonly causes uncontrolled cell growth in the lungs. On the other hand, a drop in blood pressure due to excessive blood transfusion is unlikely to cause uncontrolled cell proliferation."}}
{"Q": "He found that was a capuchin. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has met a monkey with a opposable thumb. (B) The researchers dissected a perch.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom has met a monkey with an opposable thumb.\nExplanation: Capuchin monkeys are known for their opposable thumbs, which allow them to grasp and manipulate objects with great dexterity. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom identified the animal as a capuchin because he observed its opposable thumb, rather than the researchers dissecting a perch having any connection to the identification of the monkey."}}
{"Q": "He utilized interleukins to connect them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The researcher had to made chains of different numbers of  antibody molecules. (B) The doctor found that the cells on Tom's arm began to move inwards.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Interleukins are signaling molecules that help to regulate the immune response. In this context, it is more likely that the researcher utilized interleukins to connect different antibody molecules in order to create chains with specific properties, rather than using them to cause cells on Tom's arm to move inwards."}}
{"Q": "Tom fainted on the mountain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom had edema and erythema on his arm. (B) The doctor diagnosed him as acrophobia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Fainting on a mountain can be a sign of altitude sickness, which can cause edema (swelling) and erythema (redness) in the affected area. Acrophobia is a fear of heights and would not be a medical diagnosis for someone who fainted on a mountain."}}
{"Q": "Her eyes are affected. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy suffers from diabetes. (B) Sophia has some small spherical opaque white protrusions on her face.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lucy suffers from diabetes.\nExplanation: Diabetes can cause damage to the blood vessels in the eyes, leading to various eye problems such as diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy's eye problems are caused by her diabetes rather than small spherical opaque white protrusions on her face (which may not necessarily affect her eyes)."}}
{"Q": "The doctor prescribed him medicine for frostbite. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) In the cold wind, the listening ability of his ears was damaged. (B) In the cold wind, the epidermis tissue of his ears was damaged.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Frostbite occurs when the skin and underlying tissues freeze due to exposure to cold temperatures. Choice B correctly identifies that the epidermis tissue of his ears was damaged due to exposure to cold wind, leading to frostbite. Choice A, on the other hand, suggests that his hearing ability was damaged, which is not related to frostbite."}}
{"Q": "He could face the common tantrums. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was ready to have a kid. (B) Jack's family cultivated his good habits.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person in question is capable of handling tantrums, which implies that he has experience dealing with children. Option A suggests that he is ready to have a kid, but it does not necessarily mean that he has experience dealing with children. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Jack's family has cultivated good habits in him, which could mean that he has been around children and has learned how to handle their tantrums. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom feels dizzy while working in the office. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mom supervised him to exercise. (B) Colleagues opened the window for him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Colleagues opened the window for him.\nExplanation: Feeling dizzy while working in an office could be due to poor ventilation or lack of fresh air. Opening a window can help improve air circulation and alleviate the symptoms of dizziness. It is unlikely that Tom's mom would supervise him to exercise in the office as a solution to his dizziness."}}
{"Q": "Luna cares about her dog. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Luna got a collie. (B) Sean has a pet dog.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Luna got a collie.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Luna's care for her dog is a result of her getting a collie. Getting a pet often leads to a strong emotional attachment and sense of responsibility towards the animal. Therefore, it is likely that Luna's love and care for her dog is a direct result of her getting a collie. On the other hand, Sean having a pet dog does not necessarily have any direct impact on Luna's care for her own dog."}}
{"Q": "They don't have enough food to fill their stomaches. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Vagrants are impecunious. (B) The girl already knew what caused styes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the reason for not having enough food is due to being impecunious or poor. Option B is irrelevant and does not provide any explanation for the situation mentioned in the statement."}}
{"Q": "The safety of the roadways was under greater threats of speeding cars. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The traffic was very busy on the city streets. (B) All radars on the road were broken.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The traffic was very busy on the city streets.\nExplanation: When the traffic is busy on the city streets, drivers may become impatient and try to speed to get to their destination faster. This can lead to a greater threat to the safety of the roadways. On the other hand, if all radars on the road were broken, it would not necessarily lead to an increase in speeding cars as there are other ways to monitor and enforce speed limits such as police officers and speed cameras. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom always wore very few clothes when he was young. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His heat loss from the skin decreased. (B) He has a varicocele.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: When someone wears very few clothes, their heat loss from the skin increases, not decreases. This can lead to hypothermia or other health problems. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Tom's body may have adapted to the increased heat loss by decreasing it, possibly through increased body hair or other physiological changes. Option B, on the other hand, is not related to the given information and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The child mistook the chameleon for a lizard. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mother took the children to see the chameleon. (B) We went on a trip to the woods.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Mother took the children to see the chameleon.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the child mistook the chameleon for a lizard because they were taken to see the chameleon by their mother. If they had gone on a trip to the woods, it is less likely that they would have encountered a chameleon, as they are not native to wooded areas. Additionally, if they had encountered a chameleon in the woods, it is less likely that the child would have mistaken it for a lizard, as they would have been more likely to have seen lizards before. Therefore, it is more likely that the child mistook the chameleon for a lizard because they were specifically shown a chameleon by their mother."}}
{"Q": "The sun shines bright like a diamound. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The snowfall is coming. (B) Plants is conducting photosynthesis and grow stronger.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Plants is conducting photosynthesis and grow stronger.\nExplanation: When the sun shines bright, it provides the necessary energy for plants to conduct photosynthesis, which is the process of converting sunlight into energy for growth. Therefore, it is more plausible that plants would grow stronger as a result of the sun shining bright, rather than snowfall coming."}}
{"Q": "This was originally a heath. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It saw the death of many cranes. (B) There used to be many animal species.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There used to be many animal species.\nExplanation: As a heath, the area would have been a natural habitat for a variety of animal species. However, if the heath was converted or developed for human use, such as for agriculture or urbanization, it could have resulted in the loss of habitat and a decline in animal populations. This is a more plausible answer than (A) because the death of many cranes would be a specific and unlikely event, whereas the loss of animal species due to habitat destruction is a common occurrence."}}
{"Q": "The parliament changed their decisions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Citizens were not satisfied with the statutes. (B) Brucellosis has invaded this country.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The citizens' dissatisfaction with the statutes is a more plausible reason for the parliament changing their decisions as it is a common reason for changes in legislation. Brucellosis, while a serious issue, is not likely to directly impact parliamentary decisions unless it is related to a specific statute or policy."}}
{"Q": "John wants to catch some sparrows. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John laid a trap on the edge of the cliff. (B) John laid a trap on the edge of the lake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Sparrows are typically found in areas with trees and bushes, such as cliffs or parks. Therefore, it is more plausible that John would lay a trap on the edge of a cliff rather than a lake. Additionally, sparrows are not typically associated with bodies of water, making option B less likely."}}
{"Q": "The water in the lake evaporates a lot in the hot summer weather. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Geese usually build their nests near the water. (B) A few days later, it rained heavily in this area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: When the water in the lake evaporates, the water level decreases, which means the shoreline moves further away from the original water level. This may cause geese to build their nests closer to the water's edge, as it becomes more accessible. Option B, heavy rain, is less likely to occur as a direct result of evaporation, as it is a separate weather phenomenon."}}
{"Q": "This led to his getting worse and suffering from cancer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack's research work exposed him to radium radiation for a long time. (B) Frank was diagnosed with melanomas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jack's research work exposed him to radium radiation for a long time.\nExplanation: Exposure to radium radiation for a long time can lead to the development of cancer. This is a well-known fact in the scientific community and has been documented in numerous studies. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack's cancer was caused by his exposure to radium radiation during his research work. Option B, which suggests that Frank was diagnosed with melanomas, is not relevant to the question and does not provide a plausible explanation for Jack's cancer."}}
{"Q": "The factory discharges sewage into the sea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Most of the males are leaders and most of the females who are excellent as those males are general workers. (B) The marine environment has been destroyed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Discharging sewage into the sea can lead to water pollution, which can harm marine life and destroy the marine environment. This can have a significant impact on the ecosystem and the livelihoods of people who depend on the sea for food and income. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A is unrelated to the given scenario and does not make sense."}}
{"Q": "Tom put a bottle of water with 50% contaminants and 50% pathogens in his room three days ago. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found the water became sweeter. (B) Now the contaminants in the bottle are 80%.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is unlikely that the water became sweeter as contaminants and pathogens do not affect the taste of water. However, it is possible that the pathogens in the water have multiplied over the three days, increasing the percentage of contaminants in the bottle. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The students get the knowledge. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A teacher makes a presentation. (B) The teacher asked them to draw isobars under given information.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the students acquired knowledge, which implies that they were taught something. Option A states that a teacher made a presentation, which is a common method of teaching. Option B mentions drawing isobars, which is a specific task and may not necessarily lead to knowledge acquisition. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Silver can transfer energy very efficiently. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bought an amethyst. (B) Silver has the strongest electrical conductivity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Silver has the strongest electrical conductivity.\nExplanation: Silver is known for its high electrical conductivity, which means it can easily transfer energy in the form of electricity. This is due to the way its atoms are arranged, which allows for the easy movement of electrons. As a result, silver is often used in electrical wiring, circuitry, and other applications where efficient energy transfer is important. Choice (A) is not a plausible answer as buying an amethyst has no relation to the efficient energy transfer of silver."}}
{"Q": "It has good ability to strech. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This machine is designed to use X-rays to look inside an object. (B) This string has strong elasticity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This string has strong elasticity.\nExplanation: The ability to stretch is a characteristic of elasticity, which is a property of materials like rubber or certain types of strings. X-rays are not related to the ability to stretch, so option (A) is not a plausible answer. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely explanation for the string's ability to stretch."}}
{"Q": "Jack lives in the southeastern United States. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He's been seeing hummingbirds around his house lately. (B) He is likely to see cottonmouths around.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Since Jack lives in the southeastern United States, which is known for its humid and swampy environment, it is more likely that he will see cottonmouths around his house rather than hummingbirds. Cottonmouths are venomous snakes that are commonly found in the southeastern United States, especially near water sources. On the other hand, hummingbirds are more commonly found in areas with flowers and nectar, which may not be as prevalent in the southeastern United States. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mario's uncle murdered an old lady. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was doomed to be sent into a prison. (B) He died soon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He was doomed to be sent into a prison.\nExplanation: Murder is a serious crime and is punishable by law. Mario's uncle committed a heinous act by murdering an old lady, and as a result, he would be arrested and tried in court. If found guilty, he would be sentenced to prison for a certain period of time. Death penalty is not a common punishment for murder in many countries, so option B is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "A series of pictures were added to explain those differences. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I cut all buds of the twig. (B) There are some differences between this two methods.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The addition of pictures to explain the differences between two methods suggests that there are indeed differences between the methods. Option (A) does not provide a plausible explanation for why pictures would be added. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely cause."}}
{"Q": "We always saw amphibians asleep. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We came to the boundary of the wildlife habitat. (B) Winter is a proper season for amphibians.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Amphibians are ectothermic, meaning their body temperature is regulated by the environment around them. During the winter, temperatures drop and many amphibians enter a state of hibernation or torpor to conserve energy and survive the cold. This is why we often see them asleep during this season. Choice A is not a plausible answer as the boundary of a wildlife habitat would not necessarily cause amphibians to be asleep."}}
{"Q": "Jorge caught Mumps before his marriage. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jorge had a son after his marriage with his wife. (B) George and his wife have't had  children for a long time since their marriage.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Mumps is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the testicles in males, which can lead to infertility. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jorge and his wife have not had children for a long time since his infection with mumps before their marriage. It is not necessarily impossible for them to have a son after marriage, but it is less likely due to the potential impact of mumps on male fertility."}}
{"Q": "Jerry lying beside the bay needs some water to wash his feet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He walked to the bay. (B) He ran to the bathroom to take a bath under his father's permission.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He walked to the bay.\nExplanation: Since Jerry is already lying beside the bay, it is more plausible that he would simply walk to the bay to wash his feet rather than running to the bathroom to take a bath under his father's permission."}}
{"Q": "Ladybugs can not live in cold environment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They appear in summer and autumn. (B) They appear in winter and spring.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) They appear in summer and autumn.\nExplanation: Ladybugs are cold-blooded insects and cannot survive in extremely cold temperatures. Therefore, they tend to appear in warmer seasons like summer and autumn when the temperature is suitable for their survival and reproduction. In winter and spring, they may hibernate or seek shelter in warm places to survive."}}
{"Q": "The researcher discovered it's undergoing the mitosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The scientist has found spermatocytes in the rabbit. (B) The researcher put some Spirogyras under the microscope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Mitosis is a process of cell division that occurs in eukaryotic cells. Spirogyras are a type of green algae that undergo mitosis as part of their normal growth and reproduction. Therefore, it is more plausible that the researcher observed mitosis in Spirogyras under the microscope rather than finding spermatocytes in a rabbit, which would not necessarily indicate mitosis."}}
{"Q": "Tom abuses drug. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has dependence on drug. (B) A lot of problems arise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: When someone abuses drugs, they can develop a dependence on the substance. This means that their body has become accustomed to the drug and they may experience withdrawal symptoms if they try to stop using it. Additionally, drug abuse can lead to a variety of physical and mental health problems, as well as social and legal issues. While option B is also true, option A is a more direct and likely consequence of drug abuse."}}
{"Q": "He went to the vet to buy medicine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The serval is tired. (B) Tom's sheep always have diarrhea.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence does not mention anything about a serval being tired, but it does mention Tom's sheep having diarrhea, which could be a reason for needing to buy medicine from a vet. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It is a buck. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The hunter saw a buck near his hut. (B) This deer has  large flattened shovel-shaped antlers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that someone saw a buck, and the most likely scenario is that a hunter saw it near his hut. Option B is not a plausible answer as it only describes the physical characteristics of the deer and does not provide any context for why the sentence was written."}}
{"Q": "Tom took away the Prisms in the binoculars. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The binoculars cannot bend the light. (B) Since then, Tom loves to wear sunglasses.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Prisms in binoculars are responsible for bending the light and allowing the viewer to see a magnified image. Without the prisms, the binoculars would not be able to bend the light and therefore would not be able to function properly. Therefore, choice A is the more plausible answer. Choice B is not related to the removal of prisms in binoculars and is not a logical consequence of the action."}}
{"Q": "She bought a new kind of honey. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She preferred the viscosity of the old honey. (B) She made some hennas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She preferred the viscosity of the old honey.\nExplanation: The sentence only mentions that she bought a new kind of honey, but it doesn't provide any information about what she did with it. Therefore, it is more plausible that she simply tried the new honey and found that she preferred the viscosity (thickness) of her old honey. Option B, making hennas, seems unrelated and unlikely based on the given information."}}
{"Q": "The doctor gave him some medicine involving codeine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His condition of tussis askes for centrally applied medicine. (B) The patient can't stop coughing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Codeine is a centrally acting cough suppressant that is commonly used to treat coughs. Therefore, the most plausible reason for the doctor to prescribe medicine involving codeine is that the patient's condition of tussis (cough) requires centrally applied medicine."}}
{"Q": "The smooth becomes smooth. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The stone was erosed. (B) ADIS's doctor says ADIS's brain always unabated thinking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that something rough or uneven (the \"stone\") was made smooth. The most likely cause of this would be erosion, which is the gradual wearing away of a surface by natural forces like wind or water. Option B, which mentions ADIS's brain, is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for the smoothness of the stone."}}
{"Q": "The wrapping materials were degraded. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The vegetation was destroyed. (B) Prominent reduction of their pollution was achieved.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The vegetation was destroyed.\nExplanation: If the wrapping materials were degraded, it means they broke down or decomposed. If these materials were left in the environment, they could have released harmful chemicals or microplastics that could have harmed the vegetation. Additionally, if the degraded materials were used to wrap plants or trees, they could have suffocated or damaged the plants, leading to their destruction. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B is not likely because the degradation of wrapping materials would not necessarily lead to a reduction in pollution unless they were properly disposed of or recycled."}}
{"Q": "Salmon is found highest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A mongoose and a venomous snake are placed in one big box. (B) They tested the fatty acids in a variety of fish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement mentions that salmon is found highest, which suggests that it has a high concentration of something. The most likely explanation for this is that researchers tested the fatty acids in a variety of fish and found that salmon had the highest concentration. Choice (A) is not relevant to the statement and does not provide a plausible explanation for why salmon is found highest."}}
{"Q": "Many caterpillars pupate here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It is in the lovely season. (B) There are many cocoons spuns in leaf litter on the ground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The presence of many cocoons spun in leaf litter on the ground suggests that this is a suitable environment for caterpillars to pupate. The leaf litter provides a protective layer and insulation for the cocoons, and the abundance of caterpillars in the area may indicate that there is a good food source for them to feed on before entering the pupal stage. The lovely season (choice A) may be a contributing factor, but it is not a direct cause of the caterpillars pupating in this location."}}
{"Q": "He suffered from depression. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has been very anxious about work recently. (B) The psychopath ate too much Neuroleptics.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Depression can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress and anxiety. Choice A suggests that Tom has been experiencing work-related anxiety, which could contribute to his depression. Choice B, on the other hand, suggests that the cause of depression is due to the consumption of too much Neuroleptics, which is not a common cause of depression. Therefore, choice A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There is no food in the village. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) All the villagers went on strike. (B) Human must be here for their food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the villagers would have to find a way to obtain food, rather than going on strike. The statement \"Human must be here for their food\" suggests that the villagers would have to find a way to bring in food from outside the village or find a way to grow their own food."}}
{"Q": "The driver wore a pair of sungalsses. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His entire external ears is enclosed in a rigid cups. (B) His eyes can adapt to bright conditions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His eyes can adapt to bright conditions.\nExplanation: Sunglasses are designed to protect the eyes from bright sunlight and harmful UV rays. By wearing sunglasses, the driver's eyes can adapt to bright conditions without being strained or damaged by the sun's glare. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as sunglasses do not enclose the external ears in rigid cups."}}
{"Q": "The scientist studies cloning. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She knows much about the process of producing clones. (B) The machines can still work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She knows much about the process of producing clones.\nExplanation: Since the scientist studied cloning, it is likely that she gained knowledge and expertise in the process of producing clones. This answer is more plausible than option B, which is unrelated to the study of cloning."}}
{"Q": "She is the witness of the homicide. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lily is pregnant. (B) Jane saw the driver killed by others.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Jane witnessed the driver being killed by others is a more plausible explanation for the homicide than Lily being pregnant. Being pregnant does not necessarily lead to homicide, whereas witnessing a murder is a clear motive for homicide."}}
{"Q": "Buttermilk was my allergen. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I suffered from a nerve injury. (B) I had allergic reactions to a number of dairy drinks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I had allergic reactions to a number of dairy drinks.\nExplanation: Buttermilk is a dairy drink, and if someone is allergic to dairy, they may experience allergic reactions when consuming it. It is more plausible that the cause of the allergic reaction was due to the dairy content in buttermilk rather than a nerve injury."}}
{"Q": "The government can't take use of the universal method. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are not too many people in this village. (B) My father is an evolutionist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement about the government not being able to use the universal method seems unrelated to the fact that the speaker's father is an evolutionist. Therefore, option B can be ruled out. Option A, on the other hand, provides a possible reason for why the universal method cannot be used - there may not be enough people in the village to make it feasible."}}
{"Q": "Tom put some yeast when baking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He made delicious bread. (B) They hardened.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He made delicious bread.\nExplanation: Yeast is a key ingredient in bread-making as it helps the dough rise and gives the bread its fluffy texture. Without yeast, the bread would be dense and hard. Therefore, it is more plausible that adding yeast would result in delicious bread rather than hardened bread."}}
{"Q": "The production of mineral extraction processing has been drastically reduced. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a shortage of raw materials for tailings processing plants. (B) Plant production has expanded.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There is a shortage of raw materials for tailings processing plants.\nExplanation: If the production of mineral extraction processing has been drastically reduced, it means that there is less material being extracted from the mines. This would result in a shortage of raw materials for tailings processing plants, which rely on the extracted minerals to operate. Option B, stating that plant production has expanded, is unlikely as it contradicts the initial statement that production has been reduced."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought a lot marijuana by coincidence. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He kept it for its high potential. (B) Tom was banned from smoking by his wife.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom would keep the marijuana for its high potential rather than being banned from smoking by his wife. If he bought it by coincidence, he may have been curious to try it or may have intended to sell it for profit. It is unlikely that his wife would ban him from smoking without any prior discussion or agreement."}}
{"Q": "Tom read the manual carefully. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom needed to do operation. (B) He found many pictures.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tom needed to do operation.\nExplanation: Reading the manual carefully would have given Tom a better understanding of how to operate whatever the manual was for. Therefore, it is more plausible that as a result of reading the manual carefully, Tom needed to do an operation. Finding many pictures may have been a helpful supplement to the manual, but it would not necessarily lead to a specific action like needing to do an operation."}}
{"Q": "He was sentenced to prison. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He surprisingly found that prisoners could read in the reading room and learn about the outside world through TV. (B) He was electrocuted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is highly unlikely that someone would be electrocuted as a result of being sentenced to prison. Option A is a more plausible answer as it is common for prisons to have reading rooms and televisions for inmates to use. It is also possible for inmates to learn about the outside world through these resources."}}
{"Q": "I planted watermelon in my garden. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The peacock in the distance rushed to save it immediately. (B) I used pesticides to them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person used pesticides to protect the watermelon from pests or diseases rather than a peacock rushing to save it."}}

(B) Tom's profit is 0 this month.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tom's turnover and cost are equal, it means that he did not make any profit this month. Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost from the turnover, so if they are equal, the profit is zero. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Caterpillars are not as pretty as butterflies. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The clouds are very thick in the sky. (B) Caterpillars are not colorful.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Caterpillars are not colorful.\nExplanation: Caterpillars are not as pretty as butterflies because they lack the bright and vibrant colors that butterflies have. Caterpillars are usually brown or green, which helps them blend in with their surroundings and avoid predators. As they transform into butterflies, they develop colorful wings that help them attract mates and deter predators. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) about thick clouds in the sky is not related to the appearance of caterpillars and butterflies."}}
{"Q": "He became mature. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob's mentality has changed a lot recently. (B) He watched the growth stages of podetium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement \"He became mature\" implies a change in mentality or behavior, which is more likely to be caused by a change in mindset or experiences, rather than watching the growth stages of a plant (option B). Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mike should take scientific facts into consideration. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike is an economist. (B) Mike was asked to create a new template.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mike is an economist.\nExplanation: As an economist, Mike may not have a strong background in science and may not be accustomed to considering scientific facts in his work. Therefore, it is important for him to make a conscious effort to take scientific facts into consideration, especially if they are relevant to his work."}}
{"Q": "The service staff of this hotel lack management. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The service quality of the hotel has seriously declined. (B) In addition to financial management courses, she also studied economic law and tax law.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If the service staff of a hotel lack management, it is likely that they will not be properly trained or supervised, leading to a decline in service quality. This can result in negative reviews, decreased customer satisfaction, and ultimately, a loss of business for the hotel. Choice B is unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Jerry doesn't want to hiccup. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The only way is not to breathe. (B) The only way is not to shout.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The only way is not to breathe.\nExplanation: Hiccups are caused by a sudden contraction of the diaphragm muscle, which can be triggered by a variety of factors such as eating too quickly or drinking carbonated beverages. Holding one's breath is a common method to try and stop hiccups, as it can help to reset the diaphragm muscle. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jerry would try to stop his hiccups by not breathing rather than not shouting."}}
{"Q": "The garden bloomed with roses. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It felt at ease. (B) He found that different rose leaves had different shapes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It felt at ease.\nExplanation: The sentence describes the garden blooming with roses, which creates a peaceful and beautiful atmosphere. The phrase \"bloomed with roses\" suggests that the roses are flourishing and thriving, which can make the garden feel more relaxed and at ease. Option B, on the other hand, is not directly related to the blooming of the roses and seems like an unrelated observation. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They receive government benefits every month. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They are poor and can't work. (B) Otters move into a new habitat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They are poor and can't work.\nExplanation: The most likely cause for someone to receive government benefits every month is that they are in a situation where they are unable to work and support themselves financially. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as disability, unemployment, or being a senior citizen. Otters moving into a new habitat has no correlation with receiving government benefits."}}
{"Q": "Tom keeps a poodle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He fed them with grass. (B) His monthly expenses soars.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His monthly expenses soars.\nExplanation: Keeping a poodle as a pet requires regular grooming, veterinary check-ups, and high-quality food, which can be expensive. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's monthly expenses would increase rather than him feeding the poodle with grass, which is not a suitable diet for dogs."}}

(B) Tom has calculate the density of the plants in a wrong way.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Compacting a plant would not result in the successful extraction of lysosomes. However, it could potentially affect the density of the plant material, leading to incorrect calculations if Tom was trying to determine the density of the plants."}}
{"Q": "The cancer cells died because they lost the ability to multiple. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor adopted radiotherapy to treat his cancer. (B) The particles that make up the material collide with each other.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The doctor adopted radiotherapy to treat his cancer.\nExplanation: Radiotherapy is a treatment that uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells by damaging their DNA. This damage can prevent the cancer cells from being able to divide and multiply, ultimately leading to their death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cancer cells lost the ability to multiply due to the radiotherapy treatment. Option B, which refers to the collision of particles, is not related to the cause of cancer cell death."}}
{"Q": "He wasn't thrown from the bus in the  car accident. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He fastened seatbelts when getting on the bus. (B) He unlocked seatbelts when getting on the bus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He fastened seatbelts when getting on the bus.\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer because if he had fastened his seatbelt when getting on the bus, he would have been secured in his seat during the car accident and not thrown from the bus. On the other hand, if he had unlocked his seatbelt when getting on the bus, he would have been unrestrained during the accident and more likely to be thrown from the bus."}}
{"Q": "Technology has been advanced. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The telecommunting is convenient. (B) The electronic devices human use become more abundant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Both (A) and (B) are plausible answers.\nExplanation: With the advancement of technology, telecommuting has become more convenient as people can work from anywhere with the help of electronic devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

{"Q": "He was sent to the hospital for treatment soon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The president recently felt worse. (B) Tom had a lung infection.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom had a lung infection.\nExplanation: The sentence states that he was sent to the hospital for treatment soon, implying that there was a medical issue that required attention. Option A, which suggests that the president felt worse, is not relevant to the sentence and lacks context. Option B, on the other hand, provides a plausible reason for Tom's hospitalization. A lung infection can be a serious condition that requires medical attention, and it is a common reason for hospitalization. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause of Tom's hospitalization."}}
{"Q": "Jack ate rotten fruit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack has a stomach bug. (B) Jack became malnourished and was losing weight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jack has a stomach bug.\nExplanation: Eating rotten fruit can lead to food poisoning, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. These symptoms are commonly referred to as a stomach bug. Becoming malnourished and losing weight would not be an immediate result of eating rotten fruit."}}
{"Q": "The farm brings in artificial pollination researchers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The farm is worried about the decrease in the number of bees this year. (B) The farm is worried about the decrease in the number of flowers this year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The decrease in the number of bees is a well-known issue that affects pollination in many farms. Artificial pollination researchers are brought in to compensate for the lack of bees and ensure that the crops are properly pollinated. The decrease in the number of flowers would not necessarily require artificial pollination researchers, as there would still be enough bees to pollinate the remaining flowers."}}

(B) All the refugees had was food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that there is a starving tayra, which is the cause of it eating lots of fruits. Choice B is not relevant to the sentence and does not provide a logical explanation for the tayra's behavior."}}
{"Q": "My mom as a midwife was respected by others. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My mom is a queen. (B) Women's health care providers with advanced educations deserves respect.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Women's health care providers with advanced educations deserves respect.\nExplanation: Midwifery is a highly skilled profession that requires advanced education and training. Midwives are responsible for the health and well-being of both the mother and the baby during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. As such, they are highly respected members of the healthcare community. It is not because my mom is a queen, but rather because of her profession and the expertise she brings to it that she is respected by others."}}
{"Q": "He hunts deer for a living. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Thomas is an Indian. (B) Tom is a guide.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom is a guide who takes people on hunting trips and earns a living from it, rather than being an Indian who solely relies on hunting for survival."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have crossed grapes with other species. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists planted grapes in another place. (B) Scientists have bred a new type of crop with grapes and resistant species.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Scientists have crossed grapes with other species in order to breed a new type of crop that is resistant to certain diseases or pests. This is a common practice in agriculture to improve crop yields and sustainability. Planting grapes in another place would not require crossing with other species."}}
{"Q": "These bodies in the universe are large enough to be detectable by telescope. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Astronomical spectrometers provide eye protection. (B) They are called as Asteroids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They are called as Asteroids.\nExplanation: When bodies in the universe are large enough to be detectable by telescope, they are typically referred to as asteroids. This is because asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the sun and are often visible from Earth. Astronomical spectrometers, on the other hand, are instruments used to measure the properties of light emitted by celestial objects, and have no direct relation to the detection of large bodies in the universe."}}
{"Q": "Many domestic cats lack the ability of adaptation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are ill-adapted. (B) They can't live well in a strange environment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Domestic cats that lack the ability of adaptation may struggle to live well in a strange environment. This means that they may have difficulty adjusting to new surroundings, finding food and shelter, and avoiding danger. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A may also be true to some extent, but it is not as specific or accurate as option B."}}
{"Q": "Lisa goes to hospital to inject salt water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lisa lacks calcium in her body. (B) Lisa lacks water in her body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Lisa lacks water in her body, she may need to receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of saline solution (salt water) to rehydrate her. Calcium deficiency would not be treated with saline solution."}}
{"Q": "Cathy put on some lotion today. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She began to lose her weight. (B) Cathy's skin looked beautiful.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Cathy's skin looked beautiful.\nExplanation: It is common knowledge that lotion is used to moisturize and nourish the skin, making it look healthier and more radiant.

{"Q": "He was diagnosed with heart diseases. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom injured his head in the car accident. (B) The president recently felt worse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the given choices are plausible causes for heart disease. Heart disease can have various causes such as genetics, unhealthy lifestyle habits, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact cause of the individual's heart disease."}}
{"Q": "During the Republican period, warlords strictly controlled public opinion. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He gained mental awareness. (B) Intellectuals hid in Peking University's library to debate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: During the Republican period, warlords strictly controlled public opinion, leading to a suppression of intellectual freedom. As a result, many intellectuals sought refuge in Peking University's library to engage in debates and discussions away from the watchful eyes of the authorities. This became known as the \"Peking University Debates\" and was a significant moment in Chinese intellectual history. Option A, gaining mental awareness, is not a plausible answer as it is not directly related to the suppression of intellectual freedom by warlords."}}
{"Q": "He can't get close to pyrethrum. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Logan is allergic to chrysanthemum. (B) He has something wrong with his muscles controlling the diaphragm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Pyrethrum is derived from chrysanthemum flowers, and Logan's inability to get close to it suggests that he may be allergic to chrysanthemum. Option B, which suggests a muscle issue, is not related to pyrethrum or chrysanthemum allergies."}}
{"Q": "He checked his intestinnal cell. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wanted to uproot this disease from the pathogenesis. (B) He wanted to know the details of his illness.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Checking his intestinal cells suggests that the person is likely suffering from a disease or condition affecting their digestive system. By examining the cells, the person may be trying to identify the root cause of their illness in order to develop a treatment plan that targets the underlying pathogenesis. Option A is therefore the more plausible answer. Option B suggests that the person is simply curious about the details of their illness, which is less likely given the invasive nature of examining intestinal cells."}}
{"Q": "They replaced the city's streetlights with ones that run on photovoltaic cells. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The carbon dioxide, one of the major greenhouse gases, content in the air decreases. (B) These lights turn on automatically when the sun's rays disappear.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The carbon dioxide, one of the major greenhouse gases, content in the air decreases.\nExplanation: Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electricity, which means that the streetlights no longer rely on fossil fuels to operate. This reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that would have been produced by the previous streetlights, which were powered by electricity generated from burning fossil fuels. Therefore, the replacement of the city's streetlights with ones that run on photovoltaic cells would result in a decrease in the carbon dioxide content in the air."}}
{"Q": "Tonight's homework is to draw an angel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mother explained to him patiently using the picture book at home. (B) Tom draws wings first.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom would start drawing the wings first since angels are often depicted with wings. There is no indication that his mother needed to explain anything to him or that he had access to a picture book at home."}}
{"Q": "There is no stick between these two carbon atoms. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) These two carbon atoms do not affect each other. (B) There is no bond between these two carbon atoms.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The absence of a stick (or line) between two carbon atoms in a chemical structure diagram indicates that there is no bond between them. Carbon atoms typically form four covalent bonds with other atoms, so the lack of a bond between two adjacent carbon atoms is unlikely and would result in an unstable molecule. Therefore, choice B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She can't digest well. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mom gave her some maltose. (B) She has some yogurt after dinner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She has some yogurt after dinner.\nExplanation: Yogurt contains probiotics which can help improve digestion by promoting the growth of healthy gut bacteria. Maltose, on the other hand, is a type of sugar and may not necessarily aid in digestion. Therefore, having yogurt after dinner is a more plausible answer to help improve her digestion."}}
{"Q": "Lucy falied in her experiment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She found there was some trouble with the sources of data. (B) She found the volume of the liquid decreased.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She found there was some trouble with the sources of data.\nExplanation: If Lucy failed in her experiment, it is more likely that she found some issues with the sources of data she used rather than the volume of the liquid decreasing. It is common for experiments to fail due to problems with data collection or analysis, and it is important to identify and address these issues in order to improve the experiment and obtain accurate results."}}
{"Q": "Tom is not in good health and is always ill. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has lots of pimples on his face. (B) He is much better after taking health products.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's health improved after taking health products rather than developing pimples on his face as a result of being ill."}}
{"Q": "The instruction of the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the city required the closure of public places. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The libraries in the city were closed according to the instruction. (B) Most f them were diagnosed with the sarcoidosis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The libraries in the city were closed according to the instruction.\nExplanation: The closure of public places is a common measure taken by governments to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Libraries are public places and therefore would be subject to closure according to the instruction. Option B, on the other hand, is not related to the closure of public places and is not a plausible outcome of the instruction."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a tumour in his stomach. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mom bought sundews for him. (B) He found an oncologist to treat him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He found an oncologist to treat him.\nExplanation: A tumour in the stomach is a serious medical condition that requires medical attention. The most plausible outcome would be that Tom sought out medical treatment, which would involve finding an oncologist to treat him. While his mom may have bought sundews for him as a complementary therapy, it is unlikely to be the primary course of action for treating a tumour in the stomach."}}
{"Q": "He was in a bad mood and cried every day. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This boy fell into a sad situation because he had a quarrel with his classmates. (B) He has been emotionally unstable recently.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that he has been crying every day suggests that his emotional state is unstable. While a quarrel with classmates could contribute to his bad mood, it is not enough to explain why he is crying every day. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Little Henry always goes to the intertidal zone to pick up seafood to eat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chitons can always be seen on the dining table in their home. (B) He needs dialysis every week.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Little Henry's habit of picking up seafood from the intertidal zone can lead to exposure to harmful toxins and pollutants, which can cause kidney damage and the need for dialysis. Chitons being on the dining table is not a direct consequence of this behavior."}}
{"Q": "Cannabis has destroyed some families. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are people suffering from social drugs. (B) The fertility became lower.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There are people suffering from social drugs.\nExplanation: Cannabis, like any other drug, can have negative effects on individuals and their families. It can lead to addiction, financial problems, and strained relationships. Some people may prioritize their drug use over their responsibilities and relationships, leading to the breakdown of their family unit. This can cause emotional pain and suffering for all involved. Therefore, it is important to educate individuals on the potential risks and consequences of drug use and provide support for those struggling with addiction."}}
{"Q": "He got kidney stones. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can take some medicine to force kidney stones to come out through ureters. (B) They burst when the internal and external pressures are different.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: When someone gets kidney stones, they can take medication to help the stones pass through the ureters and out of the body. Option B is not a plausible answer as kidney stones do not burst. They can cause pain and discomfort, but they do not burst like a balloon."}}
{"Q": "We should plant pistachios here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This area has serious flood problem. (B) Only the strong plants that was native to the desert environments can survive here.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that only strong plants native to desert environments can survive in this area, which implies that pistachios, being a desert plant, would be a suitable choice for planting. Choice A, on the other hand, does not provide any logical reason for why pistachios should be planted in the area."}}
{"Q": "Tom put the seeds in the greenhouse. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The seeds died. (B) The seeds germinated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.

There is something in common between them.\nExplanation: Both gourds and squash are members of the Cucurbitaceae family, which means they share similar characteristics and growing requirements. Therefore, it is likely that planting them together resulted in similar growth patterns and yields. Option A is not a plausible answer as there is no direct correlation between planting gourds and squash and the presence of germs."}}
{"Q": "There was a swamp in the village. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The villagers found it became stagnant water after several years. (B) The villagers were stuck in the swamp.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The villagers found it became stagnant water after several years.\nExplanation: Swamps are typically areas of standing water, and over time, the water can become stagnant due to lack of movement or circulation. This can lead to a buildup of bacteria and other harmful organisms, making the water unsafe for drinking or other uses. Therefore, it is more plausible that the villagers would find the swamp had become stagnant water after several years rather than being stuck in it."}}

What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Five years later, Tom become the CEO of a listed company. (B) He was always invited to meetings and gave perfect presentations.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Keeping his head clear would likely lead to better decision-making and communication skills, which could result in being invited to meetings and giving great presentations. Becoming a CEO is a significant achievement, but it may not necessarily be directly related to keeping a clear head. Option B is a more plausible outcome."}}
{"Q": "An eclipse is going to occur in one hour. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists call for planting trees. (B) Numerous of viewers have gathered on the playground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Numerous viewers have gathered on the playground.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that people would gather to witness an eclipse rather than scientists calling for planting trees. Eclipses are rare and fascinating events that attract many viewers, so it is likely that people would gather to observe it."}}
{"Q": "Artificial ecosystems are ecosystems that have been formed after human intervention and modification. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Microbes provide the fundamental underpinning in artificial ecosystems. (B) I found a list of recommended books on this topic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Microbes provide the fundamental underpinning in artificial ecosystems.\nExplanation: When humans intervene and modify an ecosystem, it can disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem. However, microbes are able to adapt and thrive in these altered environments, providing a foundation for the ecosystem to rebuild and function. Therefore, it is plausible that microbes would play a fundamental role in artificial ecosystems. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not address the question at hand."}}
{"Q": "She is a very good interpreter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She saw tuatara in New Zealand. (B) Lucy will accumulate a lot in peacetime.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Seeing tuatara in New Zealand has no direct correlation with being a good interpreter. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer.

Option (A) is not correct because the question is about the cicadas, not a tetrapod."}}
{"Q": "Their research is mainly carried out in eukaryotes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They need to study enhancer regions that control gene expression in organisms. (B) Many people tested their amount of urine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Eukaryotes have more complex gene regulation mechanisms, including enhancer regions that control gene expression. Therefore, studying eukaryotes allows researchers to better understand these mechanisms and how they contribute to gene expression and regulation. The second choice about urine testing is not relevant to the question and is not a plausible explanation for why the research is mainly carried out in eukaryotes."}}
{"Q": "The hospital hold many patients with parastic. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Most delusions of the patients are caused by amebiasis. (B) Most death of the patients are caused by amebiasis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since the hospital holds many patients with parasitic infections, it is likely that some of them may have severe cases that could lead to death. While amebiasis may cause delusions in some patients, it is not a common symptom and is unlikely to be the primary cause of most patients' delusions. On the other hand, parasitic infections can weaken the immune system and cause other complications that could lead to death. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Eventually he found that it present on the ventrolateral surfaces of vertebral body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was looking for the location of osteophytes. (B) The biologist observed the epidermis under a microscope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He was looking for the location of osteophytes.\nExplanation: Osteophytes are bony projections that can develop on the ventrolateral surfaces of vertebral bodies, which may cause pain and discomfort. Therefore, it is plausible that the person was looking for the location of osteophytes in order to diagnose or treat a patient with back pain. On the other hand, observing the epidermis under a microscope is not related to the location of osteophytes on vertebral bodies."}}
{"Q": "Tom needs to compress liquids and gases every day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom bacame overwight. (B) He prefers to compressing the gases.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: There is no direct correlation between compressing liquids and gases and becoming overweight. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer. However, option B is more plausible as Tom may have found compressing gases to be more efficient or easier than compressing liquids, leading him to prefer it."}}
{"Q": "He found a lot of layers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom cuts through epidermises. (B) The researcher analyzed the gaskets.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom cuts through epidermises.\nExplanation: The word \"layers\" suggests that Tom found multiple layers of something. The most likely explanation for this is that he was cutting through epidermises, which are layers of skin or tissue. The other option, analyzing gaskets, does not seem as relevant or likely to result in finding multiple layers."}}
{"Q": "The doctor thought she had hirsutism. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a woman with very little hair. (B) There was an excess terminal hair growth in a female with a male distribution pattern.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There was an excess terminal hair growth in a female with a male distribution pattern.\nExplanation: Hirsutism is a condition in which there is excessive hair growth in women in a male distribution pattern, such as on the face, chest, and back. This is often caused by an excess of male hormones called androgens. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer as it describes the characteristic symptoms of hirsutism. Option A is not related to hirsutism."}}
{"Q": "John's favourite flower is the cyclamen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He made the wall in his house in different colors. (B) He travelled to the Mediterranean region from Spain to Iran to learn about the history of cyclamen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John would travel to the Mediterranean region to learn about the history of cyclamen, as it is a flower that is native to that region. Making the wall in his house in different colors does not seem to be related to his love for cyclamen."}}
{"Q": "The organic matter needs to be heated to provide the conditions for electron migration. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists wants to research exoskeletons. (B) Tom needs to test the decarboxylation of organic matter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions the need to heat organic matter to provide conditions for electron migration, which is a process involved in decarboxylation. Therefore, option B, which mentions the testing of decarboxylation, is a more plausible answer than option A, which is unrelated to the process described."}}
{"Q": "The light bounces off my mirror. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Reflection of light occurred on my mirror. (B) Absorption of light occurred on my mirror.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Reflection of light occurred on my mirror.\nExplanation: When light bounces off a surface, it is called reflection. In this case, the light bounced off the mirror, which means that reflection occurred. Absorption of light would mean that the light was absorbed by the mirror and did not bounce off, which is not what happened in this scenario. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There are many asteroids in the night sky. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These asteroids form a line. (B) They are visible from the distance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: As a result of there being many asteroids in the night sky, they are visible from a distance. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they form a line."}}
{"Q": "This town made a new road last year. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The town's economy is muchu better now. (B) You should not touch its surface.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: The fact that a new road was made does not necessarily mean that the town's economy is much better now. However, it is plausible that the surface of the new road is delicate and should not be touched."}}
{"Q": "The doctor used leeches to remove excess blood. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rachel is calculating her ovulation period. (B) Leeches feed on blood.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Leeches have been used in medicine for centuries to remove excess blood from the body. This process is called bloodletting and was believed to balance the body's humors. Leeches feed on blood and their saliva contains anticoagulants, which prevent the blood from clotting. Therefore, they were used to remove excess blood from the body in cases of fever, inflammation, and other conditions. Rachel calculating her ovulation period has no relation to the use of leeches for bloodletting."}}
{"Q": "Mary used cosmetics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She felt dry eyes. (B) Soon two hyacinths built their nests on it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She felt dry eyes.\nExplanation: Using cosmetics can sometimes cause dryness in the eyes due to the chemicals present in them. This is a common side effect and can be easily treated with eye drops or by avoiding certain products. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not make logical sense for hyacinths to build nests on cosmetics."}}
{"Q": "Tom tried to find nettles in the garden. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom paied special attention to those white flowers. (B) Tom wants to draw a picture of nettles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom paid special attention to those white flowers.\nExplanation: Since nettles are often found near white flowers, it is likely that Tom was looking for these flowers in order to locate the nettles. Therefore, paying special attention to the white flowers would be a more plausible result than wanting to draw a picture of nettles."}}
{"Q": "The battle triggers world war I. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The battle is a stimuli. (B) The marshal deems that subjective feelings will also affect the outcome of the war.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The battle is a stimuli.\nExplanation: The most widely accepted cause of World War I is the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist. This event triggered a series of alliances and declarations of war among European powers, leading to the outbreak of the war. Therefore, the battle can be seen as a stimuli that set off a chain reaction of events that ultimately led to the war. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear explanation of how subjective feelings would trigger a world war."}}
{"Q": "There are some waterways. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many hippopotamus live there. (B) Many giraffes live there.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Many hippopotamus live there.\nExplanation: Hippopotamus are semi-aquatic animals and require water bodies to live in. They are commonly found in rivers, lakes, and swamps. Therefore, it is more plausible that the presence of waterways would result in many hippopotamus living there rather than giraffes, which are not adapted to living in water."}}
{"Q": "This bag containing special plastic materials was given to scientists. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) All the bad stuff in it was removed. (B) The materials were identified.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since the bag contained special plastic materials, it is more likely that the scientists identified the materials rather than removing any bad stuff from it. Identifying the materials would help the scientists understand their properties and potential uses."}}
{"Q": "Their village takes the responsibility to take care of them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are many polyps living in this area. (B) The old couple are abondoned by their only son.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that the village takes responsibility for the old couple suggests that they have no other family or support system to care for them. The mention of polyps in the area is irrelevant and does not provide a logical explanation for why the village would take on this responsibility. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This solid was purified. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Crystallization was used for this solid. (B) Ancient craftsmen knew how to use copper and tin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Crystallization was used for this solid.\nExplanation: Crystallization is a common method used to purify solids. By dissolving the solid in a solvent and then allowing the solvent to evaporate, the impurities are left behind and the pure solid can be collected. This process is often used in chemistry labs to purify compounds. On the other hand, the fact that ancient craftsmen knew how to use copper and tin is not related to the purification of a solid."}}
{"Q": "They are very diverse. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are more than a million asteroids in the universe. (B) Peter and Lisa are both from the United States.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The diversity mentioned in the question is most likely referring to the diversity of asteroids, not people. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A, as there are indeed over a million asteroids in the universe, each with their own unique characteristics and compositions."}}
{"Q": "Tom saw waves representing the ravines. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher drew a picture of local terrains. (B) The stream in front of Tom's house has been polluted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the teacher drew a picture of local terrains, which included ravines with waves. It is unlikely that pollution in a stream would cause waves to represent ravines."}}
{"Q": "Books surrounding me cause my desire to read. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My research interest is about Literature. (B) I am sitting in the library.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the person is sitting in the library surrounded by books, which is causing their desire to read. Being in a library environment with books readily available can naturally stimulate a person's interest in reading. While it is possible that the person's research interest in literature could contribute to their desire to read, it is not as likely as the immediate influence of the physical environment."}}
{"Q": "Many people lived in the kingdom. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The king's kingdom is a huge collection of individuals. (B) There used to be a kingdom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The king's kingdom is a huge collection of individuals.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the kingdom has a large population due to the fact that it is a collection of individuals under the rule of the king. Option B is not a valid explanation as it only states that there used to be a kingdom without any further explanation."}}
{"Q": "He found that it had grey bark. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found a turtle. (B) Jack looked carefully at the baobabs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of finding grey bark was Jack looking carefully at the baobabs. The sentence suggests that Jack was observing the baobabs and noticed that they had grey bark. Option A, which suggests finding a turtle, is not related to the sentence and is an irrelevant choice."}}
{"Q": "I began to improve its reproducibility. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I search for a kind of fibre via its structure. (B) My mentor stressed the realibility of my measurement.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: The cause of the improvement in reproducibility was likely due to the mentor stressing the importance of reliability in the measurement. This would have prompted the individual to take extra care in ensuring that the measurement was consistent and accurate, leading to improved reproducibility. While searching for a specific type of fiber may have contributed to the improvement, it is less likely to be the primary cause compared to the mentor's emphasis on reliability."}}
{"Q": "Tom touched the heating steel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His felt the scalding steel. (B) The metal shaft began to rotate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Tom touched the heating steel, it is more plausible that he would feel the scalding heat rather than the metal shaft beginning to rotate. The heat from the steel would cause a burning sensation on his skin, while the metal shaft rotating would require some external force or mechanism to initiate the movement."}}
{"Q": "Rabbits rarely get sick. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom kills ten rabbits and gets their venules. (B) He often feeds herbs to rabbits.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He often feeds herbs to rabbits.\nExplanation: Feeding herbs to rabbits can boost their immune system and prevent them from getting sick. This is a more plausible answer than killing rabbits and getting their venules, which would not have any direct impact on the health of other rabbits."}}
{"Q": "This factory raises a lot of rabbits and foxs. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Fur companies often come to the factory to buy leather. (B) This factory is actually a zoo.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The factory likely sells rabbits and foxes for meat or as pets.\nExplanation: It is common for farms or factories to raise animals for meat or as pets. Given that rabbits and foxes are not typically raised for their leather, option (A) is unlikely. Option (B) is also unlikely as a factory is not typically considered a zoo. Therefore, it is more plausible that the factory raises rabbits and foxes for meat or as pets."}}
{"Q": "His group begins advertising. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wants to promote his dental health. (B) Tom wants to be president.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Tom's group is advertising suggests that they are trying to gain support and visibility for his presidential campaign. There is no indication that dental health is the reason for the advertising, making option A less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Many people have experienced the violent treatment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There has been a historic battle in this city. (B) The war began.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The outbreak of war often leads to violence and mistreatment of civilians. It is a more plausible answer than A, which only suggests a past conflict without any indication of ongoing violence."}}
{"Q": "Syntax is not very easy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The structure of sentences can be complicated. (B) The structure of sentences can be limited.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Syntax refers to the structure of sentences, including the arrangement of words and phrases to create meaning. The structure of sentences can be complicated due to the various rules and conventions that govern syntax, such as subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation. Additionally, different languages have different syntax rules, which can make it challenging for learners to master. Therefore, the complexity of sentence structure is the cause of the difficulty in learning syntax."}}
{"Q": "He found that was a spermaceti. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has bought something in a waxy solid state. (B) Jack looked at part of the reproductive structure of the fungus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom has bought something in a waxy solid state.\nExplanation: Spermaceti is a waxy substance found in the head of the sperm whale. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom has bought something in a waxy solid state rather than Jack looking at part of the reproductive structure of a fungus."}}
{"Q": "Tom got distracted during the exam. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wasted a lot of time. (B) He got a failure in the examination.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Tom got distracted during the exam, it is more likely that he wasted a lot of time rather than getting a failure in the examination. Getting a failure would require him to answer all the questions incorrectly or not attempt them at all, which is not necessarily the case if he got distracted. However, getting distracted can lead to wasting time and not being able to complete the exam within the given time frame."}}
{"Q": "Rita has been jogging for two hours and oxygen in her blood is declining. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her face looks not as red as she just started jogging. (B) She often eats protein rich foods to synthesize red blood cells.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: As Rita has been jogging for two hours, her body is using up oxygen to produce energy for her muscles. This means that the oxygen levels in her blood are decreasing, which can cause her face to look less red than when she first started jogging. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is not directly related to the decrease in oxygen levels in her blood."}}
{"Q": "The villagers found very small microcrystalline interstitial patches. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) One of them recognized it as a plagioclase. (B) He found that during this process the organelle had a specific purpose within the cell.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. One of them recognized it as a plagioclase.\nExplanation: The discovery of microcrystalline interstitial patches is more likely to be related to geology or mineralogy rather than cell biology. Plagioclase is a common mineral found in igneous rocks and is often identified by its microcrystalline structure. Therefore, it is more plausible that one of the villagers recognized the patches as plagioclase rather than discovering a new organelle within a cell."}}
{"Q": "They reproduce more geerations. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are more dugongs crowded in the sea. (B) Researchers want to get granulocytes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There are more dugongs crowded in the sea.\nExplanation: When there are more individuals of a species in a given area, there is a higher likelihood of successful reproduction and survival of offspring. This could lead to an increase in the number of generations produced over time. Additionally, if there are more resources available in the environment, such as food and habitat, this could also contribute to increased reproductive success and population growth. On the other hand, the option B about researchers wanting to get granulocytes is not a plausible explanation for an increase in the number of generations of dugongs."}}
{"Q": "Upper Cave Men lived in humble dens surrounded by rocks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was suggested that they resolved conflicts through fight. (B) Scientists thus deduce they have mastered the skill to burrow soil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The fact that Upper Cave Men lived in humble dens surrounded by rocks does not necessarily suggest that they have mastered the skill to burrow soil. However, it is more plausible that they resolved conflicts through fight as they lived in a harsh environment where resources were scarce and competition for survival was high."}}
{"Q": "The air is not fresh in my van. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I want to open the window. (B) I try to keep it from coldness.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If the air in the van is not fresh, opening the window would be a more plausible solution than trying to keep it from coldness. Opening the window would allow fresh air to circulate into the van, improving the air quality. Trying to keep it from coldness would not address the issue of stale air."}}
{"Q": "Tom hasn't washed his hair for a long period. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom also has wrinkles at thirties. (B) There are a lot of head lice on his hair.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tom hasn't washed his hair for a long period, it is more likely that he would have head lice on his hair as lice thrive in unclean hair. Wrinkles at thirties are not directly related to hair washing and are more likely to be caused by other factors such as sun exposure, smoking, and genetics."}}
{"Q": "Aunt Li is in charge of cleaning. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom brings a bucket and start cleaning the dirty floor. (B) She always sneezes at work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Aunt Li is in charge of cleaning, it is more plausible that someone would start cleaning the dirty floor, like Tom bringing a bucket and starting the cleaning process. It is not likely that Aunt Li's sneezing would be a direct result of her being in charge of cleaning."}}
{"Q": "Her mother picks some cone-shaped flowers from the hop vine in the yard. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary wants some hops to make beer. (B) Mary wants some lilac flowers to decorate her room.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mary wants some hops to make beer.\nExplanation: The hop vine is commonly used to make beer, and the cone-shaped flowers are the part of the plant that is used for this purpose. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mary's mother picked the flowers for this reason rather than to decorate a room with lilac flowers."}}
{"Q": "A couple were infected by different bacterium. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Both of them took Penicillins and recovered. (B) The effect on the male patient is different from that on the female patient.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The effect on the male patient is different from that on the female patient.\nExplanation: Since the couple were infected by different bacterium, it is unlikely that both of them would be treated with the same antibiotic (Penicillins). Additionally, the fact that they were infected by different bacterium suggests that the infections were not related, and therefore the effect on each patient could be different."}}
{"Q": "The fishermen put four octopuses in a tub. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They fought fiercely with each other. (B) They lived a good life there.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the octopuses lived a good life in the tub rather than fighting fiercely with each other. Octopuses are known to be solitary creatures and can become aggressive towards each other, but in a confined space like a tub, they would not have enough room to fight. Therefore, it is more likely that they lived a good life in the tub."}}
{"Q": "This man had cancer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This man had suffered from hypercalcaemia. (B) The man was exposed to Promethium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) This man had suffered from hypercalcaemia.\nExplanation: Hypercalcaemia is a condition where there is an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood. This can lead to the development of cancer, particularly in the bones. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man's cancer was caused by hypercalcaemia rather than exposure to Promethium, which is a rare earth metal and not a known cause of cancer."}}
{"Q": "The seeds on the ground were decreasing. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many Chipmunks selected this forest as their habitat. (B) The beaker was broken into pieces.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Many Chipmunks selected this forest as their habitat.\nExplanation: Chipmunks are known to eat seeds and store them for the winter. If many chipmunks have selected this forest as their habitat, they could be consuming a large amount of the seeds on the ground, leading to a decrease in their numbers. On the other hand, option B about a broken beaker has no relation to the seeds on the ground."}}
{"Q": "Our brain can't control the knee reflex. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The neuronal signals of the knee reflex are not transmitted to the brain. (B) Knee jumping reflex is an unconditioned reflex.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Knee jumping reflex is an unconditioned reflex.\nExplanation: The knee jumping reflex, also known as the patellar reflex, is an example of an unconditioned reflex, which means it is an automatic response that does not require conscious thought or control from the brain. The reflex is triggered by a tap on the patellar tendon, which stretches the muscle fibers in the quadriceps muscle and activates the sensory neurons that send signals to the spinal cord. The spinal cord then sends a signal back to the quadriceps muscle to contract, causing the knee to jerk. Since this reflex does not involve the brain, it cannot be controlled by the brain."}}
{"Q": "The rate of plasma protein formation in mice decreased rapidly while the rate of albumin formation unchanged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Solutes chromatographically reacted with the micelles. (B) The researchers injected the mice with interleukins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The researchers injecting the mice with interleukins is a more plausible explanation for the decrease in plasma protein formation, as interleukins are known to affect protein synthesis and metabolism. Solutes chromatographically reacting with micelles is not a likely cause, as it is not clear how this would specifically affect plasma protein formation."}}
{"Q": "He only observed the reaction of glycolysis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob measured the amount of a at the beginning of the reaction. (B) Tom eliminated all the mitochondria within a cell and observed the reactions occurring in it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Bob had measured the amount of a at the beginning of the reaction, it would not explain why he only observed the reaction of glycolysis. However, if Tom eliminated all the mitochondria within a cell, he would be left with only the cytoplasmic reactions, including glycolysis. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's experimental setup caused Bob to only observe the reaction of glycolysis."}}
{"Q": "People thawed these fish, but their cells were damaged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fish in this pond are frozen. (B) People want to kill these fish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The fish in this pond are frozen.\nExplanation: If the fish were frozen, then thawing them would cause damage to their cells due to the formation of ice crystals. This is a common problem with frozen fish and can result in a loss of texture and flavor. Choice B is not a plausible answer as it does not provide a logical reason for why people would want to kill the fish in this context."}}
{"Q": "They choose to take action on summer nights. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bears can stand more extreme coldness than other animals. (B) Researchers want to observe stinkpots closely.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The given statement does not provide any information about bears or their ability to withstand coldness. On the other hand, the mention of researchers wanting to observe stinkpots closely suggests that they may be more active or visible during summer nights, which could be the reason for choosing to take action during that time. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack looks at the family photo. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack finds that every person in the photo has a different mouth shape. (B) Jack finds that every person in the photo has a different nose shape.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jack finds that every person in the photo has a different nose shape.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack would notice differences in nose shape rather than mouth shape as noses tend to be more distinctive and varied among individuals. Additionally, noses are often a prominent feature in facial recognition and identification."}}
{"Q": "Peter went to the supermarket and bought a lot of pumpkins. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor advised Peter to eat more foods rich in carotene. (B) The climate here is very adorable for plants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The doctor advised Peter to eat more foods rich in carotene, which is found in pumpkins. Therefore, it is more plausible that Peter bought a lot of pumpkins because of this advice from his doctor. The climate being adorable for plants is not a direct reason for Peter buying pumpkins."}}
{"Q": "Givenchy, who works in the petrochemical industry, wants to explore a catalyst. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His friend recommended naphthalene to him. (B) Givenchy found zeolites.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Givenchy found zeolites.\nExplanation: Givenchy's interest in exploring a catalyst led him to research and discover zeolites, which are commonly used as catalysts in the petrochemical industry. It is more plausible that he found a well-known catalyst rather than his friend recommending a specific chemical compound to him."}}
{"Q": "The doves are pregnant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They pay close attention to their baby. (B) Eggs appeared in their nests.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Eggs appeared in their nests.\nExplanation: Doves lay eggs when they are pregnant, so it is more plausible that the doves laid eggs in their nests as a result of being pregnant. While doves do care for their young, paying close attention to their baby is not a direct result of being pregnant."}}
{"Q": "Her depression has never been treated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She gets addicted to alcohol. (B) She often takes a medicine containing tamoxifen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She gets addicted to alcohol.\nExplanation: Untreated depression can lead to self-medicating behaviors, such as alcohol or drug abuse, as individuals try to cope with their symptoms. This can lead to addiction and further exacerbate their mental health issues. Tamoxifen is a medication used to treat breast cancer and is not typically prescribed for depression."}}
{"Q": "Tom put the frozen meat in the water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The frozen meat melted after an hour. (B) An hour later the frozen meat was gone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The frozen meat melted after an hour.\nExplanation: When frozen meat is put in water, it will start to thaw and eventually melt. However, it would take longer than an hour for the meat to completely disappear, making option B less plausible. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "We went to the hospital to detect genetic disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I cursed a lot in this process. (B) The doctor used pedigrees.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The use of pedigrees is a common method for detecting genetic diseases as it helps to trace the inheritance pattern of the disease within a family. Cursing during the process is not a likely outcome or relevant to the detection of the disease."}}
{"Q": "My dad was freed from the disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The immature mosquitoes in his room were killed. (B) We were pleased at his remission.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. We were pleased at his remission.\nExplanation: The statement \"My dad was freed from the disease\" implies that he recovered from his illness. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result would be that his family was happy about his remission rather than immature mosquitoes being killed in his room."}}
{"Q": "Mary found that the smaller the view,the greater the magnification. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary adjusted the angle of lens to observe the specimen. (B) This object revolved on its own axis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Mary adjusted the angle of lens to observe the specimen. This is because when the angle of the lens is adjusted to a smaller view, the light rays passing through the lens converge at a greater angle, resulting in a larger magnification of the specimen. This is a common principle in optics known as the angle of convergence. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mary adjusted the angle of the lens rather than the object revolving on its own axis."}}
{"Q": "The animals they vivisect have to   suffer the pain of being dissected soberly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Students dissect monocotyledons. (B) Some scientists vivisect animals to get the most accurate statistics.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Vivisection is the practice of performing surgery on living animals for scientific research. Some scientists believe that vivisection is necessary to obtain accurate statistics and data. However, this practice often causes animals to suffer pain and distress. Dissecting monocotyledons, which are plants, would not cause pain to animals. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The peach tree finishes the beginning of its reproduction. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fruits are ripe in autumn. (B) The peach flowers have faded and peaches emerge one by one.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The peach tree finishes the beginning of its reproduction because the peach flowers have faded and peaches emerge one by one. This is the natural process of the peach tree's reproductive cycle, where the flowers are pollinated and then develop into fruits, which eventually ripen in autumn. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He usually takes a trip. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom always has convulsions. (B) He is a naturalist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He is a naturalist.\nExplanation: The fact that he usually takes a trip suggests that he has a strong interest in nature and exploring the outdoors. Being a naturalist would be a more plausible reason for his frequent trips than having convulsions, which would likely limit his ability to travel."}}
{"Q": "She was rejected by all of the agencies. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary wants to be a success woman. (B) A middle school student, Lily, took part in many interviews of several agencies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"she\" was rejected by all of the agencies, implying that Mary was the one being referred to. The fact that Mary wants to be a successful woman may not necessarily be the cause of her rejection, but it could be a contributing factor. It is possible that Mary lacks the necessary skills or experience that the agencies are looking for, or that there is simply too much competition in the industry."}}
{"Q": "We srayed aerosol into the air to imitate that. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We wanted to imitate the cloud' reflection of sunlight. (B) We needed to imitate the mirror' reflection of sunlight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: We wanted to imitate the cloud's reflection of sunlight. Clouds reflect sunlight and create a brightening effect on the atmosphere. By spraying aerosol into the air, we can mimic this effect and study its impact on the environment. This is a common technique used in atmospheric research to understand the behavior of clouds and their impact on climate change. On the other hand, mirrors reflect light in a different way and are not relevant to this scenario. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He had just finished his meal, but soon he was hungry again. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gatsby drank a lot of yogurt. (B) Tom put his porridge into the microwave oven.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gatsby drank a lot of yogurt, which may not have been very filling, causing him to feel hungry again soon after finishing his meal. Tom putting his porridge into the microwave oven does not seem to have any direct correlation with Gatsby feeling hungry again."}}
{"Q": "People don't enter it to avoid Infection. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This forest has infected ticks. (B) The seedling has developed a primary infection.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The mention of ticks in the answer choice suggests that the forest has a tick infestation, which could lead to the spread of infections such as Lyme disease. This would make it a plausible reason for people to avoid entering the forest to avoid getting infected. On the other hand, the mention of a seedling with a primary infection does not provide enough context to explain why people would avoid entering the forest."}}
{"Q": "The boy has a rubella. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got infected again recently. (B) He goes for an antiviral vaccine injection.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He got infected again recently.\nExplanation: Rubella is a viral infection that usually occurs once in a lifetime, and once a person has had it, they develop immunity to it. Therefore, it is unlikely that the boy would need an antiviral vaccine injection. The more plausible explanation is that he got infected again recently, possibly due to exposure to someone with rubella who was not vaccinated."}}
{"Q": "Economist was attracted by this aberration. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This country in recessions had a city with prosperity. (B) There was a serious problem of corrosion in lithospheres.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. This country in recessions had a city with prosperity.\nExplanation: Economists are interested in aberrations or anomalies in economic data, and a city with prosperity during a recession would be considered an aberration. This could be due to a variety of factors such as a strong local industry, government investment, or a unique economic situation. Corrosion in lithospheres, on the other hand, is not a plausible explanation as it is a geological term and not related to economics."}}
{"Q": "He needed to calculated their task completion rates. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The teacher provided them with a variety of pedons. (B) The boss was to assess staff performance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of needing to calculate task completion rates is most likely related to the boss needing to assess staff performance. Calculating completion rates would provide a measure of how efficiently and effectively tasks are being completed, which is important information for evaluating employee performance. The fact that the teacher provided a variety of pedons is not relevant to the need for calculating completion rates."}}
{"Q": "I saw many fetishistic elements. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I went into a temple of shamanism. (B) I went into a temple of books.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I went into a temple of books.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the fetishistic elements were seen in a temple of books, such as a library or bookstore, where there may be a variety of books on different topics, including those related to fetishes or fetishism. On the other hand, a temple of shamanism may have spiritual or cultural artifacts that are not necessarily related to fetishism."}}
{"Q": "The government published a ne policy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The government announced the abolition of all taxes. (B) The public knew its meaning.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The public knew its meaning.\nExplanation: It is highly unlikely that the government would announce the abolition of all taxes as a result of publishing a new policy. However, it is reasonable to assume that the public would have some understanding of the new policy after it was published. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was sunburned. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's skin was exposed to the sun for a long time. (B) Tom's skin has been itchy lately.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom's skin was exposed to the sun for a long time.\nExplanation: Sunburn is caused by overexposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. When the skin is exposed to UV rays for a prolonged period of time, it can become red, painful, and even blistered. Itching is not a common symptom of sunburn, so option B is not a plausible answer. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of Tom's sunburn."}}
{"Q": "The boy suffers from tinea. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The boy is prone to sweating excessively. (B) This boy was exposed to contaminated rat urine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The boy is prone to sweating excessively.\nExplanation: Tinea, also known as ringworm, is a fungal infection that thrives in warm, moist environments. Excessive sweating can create the perfect conditions for the fungus to grow and spread. On the other hand, exposure to contaminated rat urine is more likely to cause diseases such as leptospirosis, which is caused by a bacteria and not a fungus. Therefore, option A is a more plausible cause of the boy's tinea."}}
{"Q": "He is exhausted now with full fatigue. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Zachary has been bothered by migraine pain for hours. (B) He has been busy all day long.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He has been busy all day long.\nExplanation: Being busy all day long can lead to exhaustion and fatigue. Migraine pain may also cause exhaustion, but it is not mentioned that Zachary has been experiencing it for hours. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jerry sweated a lot. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He became fatter. (B) He had a cramp.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He had a cramp.\nExplanation: Sweating excessively can lead to dehydration and loss of electrolytes, which can cause muscle cramps. Becoming fatter is not a direct result of sweating."}}
{"Q": "It's an estuary. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It's a very special environment here. (B) The riverbed here twists and turns.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The riverbed here twists and turns.\nExplanation: Estuaries are formed when a river meets the sea and the water flow slows down due to the mixing of saltwater and freshwater. The twisting and turning of the riverbed can create a wider and shallower area where the river meets the sea, allowing for the formation of an estuary. This is a more plausible answer than (A) as while estuaries are special environments, they are not necessarily unique to this particular location."}}
{"Q": "The bank raised interest on savings to attract the public. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The number of citizens coming to the bank to make deposits has increased. (B) Their clients were attracted and decided to cooperate with them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The number of citizens coming to the bank to make deposits has increased.\nExplanation: When the bank raises interest rates on savings, it becomes more attractive for people to deposit their money in the bank. This is because they can earn more interest on their savings. As a result, more people are likely to come to the bank to make deposits, which would increase the number of citizens coming to the bank. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is too vague and does not explain how clients were attracted or what kind of cooperation was established."}}
{"Q": "Jack leaves Beijing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack suffered from disassociation mentally. (B) He dropped out from the university.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He dropped out from the university.\nExplanation: The given information does not provide any indication that Jack suffered from disassociation mentally. However, it is possible that leaving Beijing may have caused Jack to drop out from the university if he was studying there. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have collected a lot of invertebrates. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientist can cleary classify them. (B) The scientist have done a lot of researches.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: By collecting a lot of invertebrates, scientists can study their physical characteristics and behavior, which allows them to classify them into different groups based on their similarities and differences. This helps in understanding the diversity of invertebrates and their ecological roles. However, it does not necessarily mean that the scientists have done a lot of research on them, as further studies may be required to fully understand their biology and ecology."}}
{"Q": "Logan put some neodymium into a beaker of liquid magnesium. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The neodymium dissolved. (B) The neodymium didn't dissolve.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The neodymium didn't dissolve.\nExplanation: Neodymium is a rare earth metal and is known to be highly reactive with water and acids, but not with liquid magnesium. Therefore, it is unlikely that the neodymium would dissolve in the beaker of liquid magnesium."}}
{"Q": "He found that they reached the same height. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Luck checked the basketball in his hand. (B) Tom has seen two spruces.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Luck checked the basketball in his hand.\nExplanation: It is unlikely that Tom seeing two spruces would have any impact on the height that they reached. On the other hand, Luck checking the basketball in his hand could have ensured that he had a better grip and control over the ball, allowing him to make a more accurate shot and reach the same height as Tom."}}
{"Q": "Tom was suffered a strange skin disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Herpes entered his body through tiny passages in his skin. (B) The doctor suggested that he should take use of the phytotherapy and buy some medicine containing natural plants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the doctor would suggest using phytotherapy and natural medicine to treat a skin disease rather than herpes entering his body through tiny passages in his skin. Herpes is a viral infection that is typically transmitted through direct contact with an infected person or object, and it is unlikely to be the cause of a strange skin disease. On the other hand, phytotherapy and natural medicine have been used for centuries to treat various skin conditions and have been shown to be effective in some cases."}}
{"Q": "He took a lot of pictures of different animals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has been studying animal living habits recently. (B) John went to the zoo to see the theropods.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The fact that the person took pictures of different animals suggests that they were at a place where they could see different animals, such as a zoo. Choice B mentions that John went to the zoo, which is a more plausible reason for taking pictures of different animals than choice A, which suggests that Tom has been studying animal living habits recently but does not explain why he would take pictures of different animals."}}
{"Q": "She has good credits. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Linda always pays her debt in time. (B) Lucy has a good ability of expression.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions that \"she always pays her debt in time,\" which is a common factor in building good credit. Option B, which mentions \"a good ability of expression,\" is not directly related to creditworthiness."}}
{"Q": "He has a need for heating. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought a heater. (B) He is cruel to animals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: He bought a heater.\nExplanation: It is logical that if someone has a need for heating, they would buy a heater to fulfill that need. The second option of being cruel to animals is not related to the initial statement and does not make sense as a result."}}
{"Q": "She found the  foul-tasting liquid from their limbs smelly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The experimenter studied ancient cultivated crops. (B) Lucy smelt the ladybugs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Lucy smelt the ladybugs.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"foul-tasting liquid from their limbs\" which suggests that the sentence is referring to ladybugs. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer as it suggests that Lucy found the ladybugs smelly. Option (A) is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide any explanation for the foul smell."}}
{"Q": "Recently, it has entered the flowering stage. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This cockatoo has recently been beating the trunk of a tree with a small wooden branch every day. (B) Tom bought a bulb two years ago.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the plant has entered the flowering stage because it was a bulb that was purchased two years ago. Bulbs are known to have a specific growth cycle, and after a certain amount of time, they will naturally enter the flowering stage. Beating the trunk of a tree with a small wooden branch every day would not have any direct effect on the flowering stage of a plant."}}
{"Q": "He applied it on his back, hands and feet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom bought a plaster to treat the rash. (B) Tom had pain in his knee, so he had the pressure points test.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom bought a plaster to treat the rash.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that Tom applied something on his back, hands, and feet. This suggests that he had some kind of skin irritation or rash. The most plausible answer is that he bought a plaster or ointment to treat the rash. Option B, which suggests that he had a pressure points test for knee pain, is not supported by any information in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Tanager belongs to sparrow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tanager is fed on worms. (B) All the tail snakes under this land ran away to other places.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tanager is fed on worms.\nExplanation: The statement \"Tanager belongs to sparrow\" does not make sense as they are two different bird species. Therefore, it is not possible to determine any direct result from this statement. However, if we assume that the statement is meant to say \"Tanager is a type of sparrow,\" then it is more plausible that Tanager would be fed on worms as many sparrows are known to eat insects and worms. Option B about tail snakes running away is not related to the statement and seems unlikely."}}
{"Q": "Mary devotes herself in feminism course. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The meal consists of rice, potatoes and vegetables. (B) Mary is a feminist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of Mary devoting herself in feminism course is that she is a feminist. Choice A is irrelevant and does not provide any explanation for Mary's interest in feminism."}}
{"Q": "They looked for the protocols for explaination. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They encountered an incident. (B) Tom desired to know the scientific explanation of the word.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The use of the word \"incident\" suggests that something unexpected or problematic occurred, which prompted the search for protocols to explain the situation. Option B is less likely because it implies that Tom's personal curiosity was the driving force behind the search, rather than a specific event or circumstance."}}
{"Q": "Someone offered clues accoding to the photo they posted online. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A couple of parents are playing in the park with their child. (B) A couple of parents are looking for their lost child.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. A couple of parents are looking for their lost child.\nExplanation: The fact that someone posted a photo online and offered clues suggests that they are trying to enlist the help of others in finding their lost child. If they were simply playing in the park with their child, there would be no need for clues or for involving strangers in their activities."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a transsexual. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The  reassignment expressed his perceived inner identities. (B) He also had basic needs to make love as others.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The reassignment expressed his perceived inner identities.\nExplanation: Being a transsexual means that Tom identifies as a gender different from the one assigned to him at birth. The process of reassignment surgery allows him to physically align his body with his perceived inner identity, which can be a significant step in his personal journey towards self-acceptance and fulfillment. While it is true that Tom, like any other human being, has basic needs for intimacy and connection, this is not necessarily a direct result of his being a transsexual. It is important to avoid stereotyping and stigmatizing trans individuals by reducing their experiences to mere sexual desires."}}
{"Q": "Bob decreased the speed to 50km/h. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The racers entered the deceleration phase. (B) Tom wants to accelerate the speed of the chemical reaction.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The context suggests that Bob is likely a racer, and the mention of \"decreased speed\" implies that the racers were previously going faster. Therefore, it is more plausible that the racers entered the deceleration phase, rather than Tom wanting to accelerate a chemical reaction (which is unrelated to the context)."}}
{"Q": "My pet was infected by microscopic animals called coccidia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It had Coccidiosis. (B) It had a cold.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It had Coccidiosis.\nExplanation: Coccidia are microscopic parasites that can infect the intestines of animals, including pets. When an animal is infected with coccidia, it can develop a condition called coccidiosis, which can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss. Therefore, it is more plausible that the pet had coccidiosis as a result of being infected with coccidia. A cold is a respiratory illness caused by a virus, and is not related to coccidia or intestinal parasites."}}
{"Q": "There are few tree on the mountain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This mountain often has mudslides. (B) The birds can't fly over.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. This mountain often has mudslides.\nExplanation: Trees play a crucial role in preventing soil erosion and stabilizing slopes. Without enough trees on the mountain, the soil is more likely to become loose and unstable, leading to mudslides during heavy rainfall or other natural disasters. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lack of trees on the mountain would result in mudslides rather than birds being unable to fly over."}}
{"Q": "Mario introduces his topic through a presentation while Mary just gives a speech orally. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mario draws more attention. (B) Mary draws more attention.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mario draws more attention.\nExplanation: Since Mario is using a presentation, he is able to use visual aids and other multimedia elements to enhance his message and engage the audience. This can make his presentation more interesting and memorable, which can draw more attention from the audience. On the other hand, Mary's speech may be less engaging without any visual aids or other multimedia elements, which could result in less attention from the audience."}}
{"Q": "Contraception is advocated here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The peotries of Shakespeare always talks about the inner struggle of humankind. (B) Women's health care is valued in the country.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that contraception is advocated, which suggests that there is a need for women to have access to birth control. Option B provides a more plausible reason for this advocacy, as valuing women's health care would include providing them with the means to control their reproductive health. Option A, on the other hand, is not directly related to the topic of contraception."}}
{"Q": "The identity of the dead body should be clarified. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The police will carry deep investigations. (B) Calcification happens.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The police will carry deep investigations.\nExplanation: When the identity of a dead body is not clear, it is the responsibility of the police to investigate and determine who the person was. This may involve DNA testing, fingerprint analysis, and other methods to identify the individual. Therefore, it is likely that the police will carry out deep investigations to clarify the identity of the dead body. Option B, calcification, is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the situation at hand."}}
{"Q": "The technician set  wrong computer commands. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mainframe stopped working immediately. . (B) The robot can't work properly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the wrong computer commands would affect the robot's performance rather than immediately shutting down the entire mainframe. The robot relies on precise commands to function properly, so any errors could cause it to malfunction or not work as intended."}}
{"Q": "Sam has been studying tetrapods. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam has seen creatures as big as cars, and creatures as big as slaps. (B) He inputs a lot of equations.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that Sam has been studying tetrapods, which are four-limbed vertebrates, including amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Therefore, it is more plausible that Sam has seen creatures of varying sizes, from small amphibians to large mammals, rather than inputting equations, which is not directly related to the study of tetrapods."}}
{"Q": "She died with dignity as free from pain as possible. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary's wound became inflamed in an acute attack. (B) The dying lady hear hospice from her son.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person died from a medical condition that caused pain, but efforts were made to manage the pain and provide comfort. Option A provides a plausible explanation that the wound became inflamed, causing pain, but measures were taken to alleviate the pain and allow the person to die with dignity. Option B does not provide a clear explanation for the cause of death or pain management."}}
{"Q": "Tom ate the undercooked plantains. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He tasted bitterness. (B) He added some acid to the solution.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He tasted bitterness.\nExplanation: Undercooked plantains can have a bitter taste due to the presence of tannins. Consuming undercooked plantains can result in a bitter taste in the mouth. Adding acid to the solution would not be a likely result of consuming undercooked plantains."}}
{"Q": "She removed the battery to dissipate heat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Susan's cell phone is very hot after use. (B) Mary is getting older and older.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Susan's cell phone is very hot after use, it could be due to excessive usage or a malfunctioning battery. Removing the battery can help dissipate the heat and prevent damage to the phone. On the other hand, Mary getting older has no relevance to the situation and is an unrelated option."}}
{"Q": "Tom bakes biscuit in this shop. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He needs novel ideas to bake new biscuits. (B) Tom works there as a salesman.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Tom bakes biscuits in the shop, it is likely that he is responsible for creating new recipes and flavors to keep customers interested and coming back for more. Therefore, it is plausible that he needs novel ideas to bake new biscuits. Option B is less likely as it suggests that Tom works as a salesman, which is not mentioned in the given statement."}}
{"Q": "The engineer finally chose the electromagnet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The voltage of the electric field has changed. (B) Engineers are selecting materials for giant wheels.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The choice of an electromagnet suggests that the engineer needed a magnetic field that could be turned on and off quickly, which is a characteristic of an electromagnet. The fact that the engineer chose this option implies that the voltage of the electric field was a deciding factor in the decision-making process. Choice B is not relevant to the given information and does not provide a plausible explanation for the engineer's decision."}}
{"Q": "Vinegars can make him allergic. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack is allergic to alcohol even in small amount. (B) The virus inside the nerve cell can be reactivated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Vinegars contain acetic acid, which can trigger the reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) in some individuals. This can lead to an allergic reaction, such as a rash or hives. Therefore, choice B is a more plausible answer than choice A, which is not directly related to the ingredients in vinegar."}}
{"Q": "Everyone thinks Jack is a selfish person. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack doesn't brush his teeth everyday. (B) Jack always isolates himself from others and tries every means to get what he wants without paying attention to others' needs and feelings.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Jack's behavior of isolating himself and disregarding others' needs and feelings is a more plausible reason for people to perceive him as selfish. Not brushing his teeth every day may be seen as unhygienic, but it is not necessarily a behavior that directly affects others' well-being or shows a lack of consideration for them. On the other hand, constantly putting oneself first and ignoring others' needs and feelings is a clear sign of selfishness."}}
{"Q": "This bird dates back to the carboniferous period. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cockroaches could be its prey at that time. (B) They have reproduced many generations.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The carboniferous period was around 300 million years ago, and during that time, cockroaches were one of the dominant insects on land. Therefore, it is more plausible that this bird could have preyed on cockroaches during that time rather than having reproduced many generations."}}
{"Q": "The fishes in the tank were electrocuted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom connected a socket and a fish tank with a wire. (B) Nadal put cephalopods in a fresh water fish tank.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom connected a socket and a fish tank with a wire.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because connecting a socket and a fish tank with a wire could cause an electrical current to pass through the water, electrocuting the fish. On the other hand, putting cephalopods in a fresh water fish tank would not necessarily cause electrocution."}}
{"Q": "Jack's grandfather stopped breathing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor pronounced him dead. (B) Jack asked his father for help.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The doctor pronounced him dead.\nExplanation: If someone stops breathing, it is a sign of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure, which can lead to death if not treated immediately. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the doctor pronounced him dead. Jack asking his father for help may be a possible action, but it is not a direct consequence of his grandfather stopping breathing."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to change his clothes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom soaked the pen into ink. (B) He opens the drawer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: He opens the drawer.\nExplanation: The action of wanting to change clothes would logically lead to Tom opening a drawer or closet to retrieve new clothes. Soaking a pen in ink is not related to changing clothes and would not be a plausible result."}}
{"Q": "The weather is very bad this spring. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The number of sucker is greatly reduced. (B) The flowers withered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The flowers withered.\nExplanation: Bad weather, especially excessive rain or cold temperatures, can damage or kill flowers. This can result in withering or reduced blooming. Suckers, on the other hand, are new shoots that grow from the roots of a plant and are not typically affected by weather conditions. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The nurse used a catheter to help him urinate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There is something wring with Tom's urinary system. (B) James is ill in bed and it is not convenient to go to the toilet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The use of a catheter to help with urination suggests that there is a problem with Tom's urinary system, such as a blockage or dysfunction. It is not a common practice to use a catheter simply because it is inconvenient to go to the toilet."}}
{"Q": "Hollyhocks is their worst enemy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The forestry department fears the species invasion danger. (B) Summer comes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The forestry department fears the species invasion danger.\nExplanation: Hollyhocks are not native to many areas and can become invasive, outcompeting native species and disrupting ecosystems. The forestry department may be concerned about the potential harm that hollyhocks could cause if they spread too widely. Summer coming alone would not necessarily be a cause for hollyhocks to become an enemy."}}
{"Q": "I saw iridescence on it very often. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My Peafowl was locked in its cage. (B) I had a cooked sliced ham for each lunch.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Iridescence is a phenomenon where certain surfaces appear to change color depending on the angle of light hitting them. Peafowl feathers are known for their iridescence, which is caused by the microscopic structure of the feathers reflecting light in different ways. Therefore, it is more plausible that the iridescence was seen on the Peafowl rather than being caused by a cooked sliced ham."}}
{"Q": "The connective tissue wrapping each individual axon within the nerve contains protein. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Endoneurium contains protein. (B) Cells can manufacture proteins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Endoneurium contains protein.\nExplanation: The endoneurium is the connective tissue that surrounds each individual axon within a nerve. Since the question states that this connective tissue contains protein, it is logical to conclude that the endoneurium contains protein. Choice B, which states that cells can manufacture proteins, is not directly related to the question and does not provide a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Producers are in our lives. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We benefit from producers for good life quality. (B) We benefit from producers for bad life quality.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. We benefit from producers for good life quality.\nExplanation: Producers play a crucial role in providing us with goods and services that we need for our daily lives. They create products that improve our quality of life, such as food, clothing, technology, and healthcare. Without producers, we would not have access to these essential items, and our lives would be much more difficult. Therefore, it is more plausible that we benefit from producers for good life quality."}}
{"Q": "It is indispensable to toothpastes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ticks is sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals. (B) Calcium carbonate is a gentle abrasive.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Toothpastes contain calcium carbonate, which is a gentle abrasive that helps to remove plaque and surface stains from teeth. This is essential for maintaining good oral hygiene and preventing tooth decay and gum disease. While ticks may be sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals, this has no relevance to the use of toothpaste."}}
{"Q": "John wanted to look at the list of articles. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor gave him some thrombin. (B) He looked at the bibliography and found notes in it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option A is not related to the action of looking at the list of articles. Option B is a more plausible answer as it directly addresses John's intention to look at the list of articles and suggests that he found some notes in the bibliography while doing so."}}
{"Q": "The scientists have gained new insights in their research. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The microwave has complex circuits. (B) The computer simulates the way planets move.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The computer simulating the way planets move is more likely to provide new insights in research as it allows scientists to model and test different scenarios and theories related to planetary motion. On the other hand, the complexity of microwave circuits may not necessarily lead to new insights in research unless the research is specifically focused on microwave technology."}}
{"Q": "The doctor has found eosinophils in his stomach. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom had suffers from some kind of stomach condition. (B) Tom has an inflammation in his stomach.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are typically associated with allergic reactions and inflammation. Therefore, the presence of eosinophils in Tom's stomach suggests that he has an inflammation in his stomach, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as food allergies, infections, or autoimmune disorders. While it is possible that Tom has a stomach condition, the presence of eosinophils specifically points to inflammation as the more likely cause."}}
{"Q": "HATs are implicated in transcriptional activation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The paralyzed people are less sensitive to nerve stimulation. (B) HATs are hot molecules.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement about HATs being implicated in transcriptional activation is unrelated to the statement about paralyzed people and nerve stimulation. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer as it does not contain any irrelevant information. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the topic of HATs and transcriptional activation."}}
{"Q": "They gave birth to Billy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is a student majoring in physics. (B) Tom immigranted to Africa and met Mary.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom immigrated to Africa and met Mary.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the event of Billy's birth. Option A, which states that Tom is a student majoring in physics, does not provide any connection to the birth of Billy. Therefore, option B is the more logical choice."}}
{"Q": "Pathogenic microbes sometimes attack our bodys. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientist can cleary classify them. (B) Our bodies produce a lot of phenolics.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Our bodies produce a lot of phenolics.\nExplanation: When pathogenic microbes attack our bodies, our immune system responds by producing a lot of phenolics, which are a type of antioxidant. Phenolics help to neutralize the harmful effects of the microbes and protect our cells from damage. This response is a natural defense mechanism that helps our bodies fight off infections. While scientists can classify pathogenic microbes, this is not a direct result of their attack on our bodies."}}
{"Q": "The researchers chose muons. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This experiment requires a particle that have exactly the same interactions as electrons. (B) The factory hired workers to dig the ground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Muons are similar to electrons in terms of their interactions with matter, but they are much heavier and have a shorter lifetime. This makes them useful for studying the properties of matter and for testing fundamental physics theories. Therefore, the researchers chose muons for their experiment because they needed a particle that had similar interactions to electrons but with different properties that could be studied."}}
{"Q": "Tom keeps scratching where he suffers from eczema. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is allergic to animal fur. (B) His eczema covers more and more skin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His eczema covers more and more skin.\nExplanation: Scratching eczema can cause the skin to become more irritated and inflamed, leading to the spread of the condition to other areas of the body. This is a common symptom of eczema and is known as the \"itch-scratch cycle.\" Allergies to animal fur may also cause skin irritation, but this is not necessarily related to eczema or scratching. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He learns how to recognize  the energe essence of emotions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim is learning the skill of mindfulness. (B) Mark becomes a ventriloquist after years of training.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tim is learning the skill of mindfulness.\nExplanation: Mindfulness is a practice that involves paying attention to the present moment and being aware of one's thoughts and emotions without judgment. Through mindfulness, one can learn to recognize the energy essence of emotions and develop a deeper understanding of their own emotional experiences. On the other hand, becoming a ventriloquist has no direct correlation with recognizing the energy essence of emotions. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor gave her aspirin as a substitute. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She can not stand the old drug's effect. (B) This drug has been used up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She can not stand the old drug's effect.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the doctor gave her aspirin as a substitute for another drug. The reason for this substitution is given as \"She can not stand the old drug's effect.\" This implies that the patient was experiencing some negative side effects from the previous drug and needed a replacement. Option A is the most plausible answer. Option B is not relevant to the sentence and does not provide a logical explanation for the substitution."}}
{"Q": "Tom has overcomed a lot of barriers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has to find one more person. (B) He finally succeeded.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He finally succeeded.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Tom has overcome a lot of barriers, which implies that he has faced many challenges and obstacles. The use of the word \"overcome\" suggests that he has successfully dealt with these barriers. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of overcoming these barriers would be that he finally succeeded in his endeavors. Choice A, on the other hand, seems unrelated and does not follow logically from the given statement."}}
{"Q": "Jack doesn't like vegetables with slender stalks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) But paramecium is an exception. (B) He never eats celery.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Jack doesn't like vegetables with slender stalks, he never eats celery, which has a slender stalk. This is a logical consequence of his dislike for such vegetables. Choice A, which mentions paramecium, is not related to the given information and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Piroplasmosis has spread in this area. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Numerous livestock in this area died which causes great economic loss. (B) The size of the population is affected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Piroplasmosis is a tick-borne disease that affects livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats. It can cause fever, anemia, and even death in severe cases. If piroplasmosis has spread in an area, it is likely that numerous livestock in that area have died, which can cause great economic loss for farmers and the local economy. The size of the population is not directly affected by piroplasmosis, as it is a disease that primarily affects livestock."}}
{"Q": "Mr. Howard added titanium dioxide as raw material when making corundum. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He succeeded in making sapphire. (B) He got some small melons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He succeeded in making sapphire.\nExplanation: Titanium dioxide is a common additive used in the production of synthetic sapphire, which is a type of corundum. When added to the raw materials, it helps to improve the crystal structure and overall quality of the sapphire. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mr. Howard was successful in making sapphire rather than getting small melons."}}
{"Q": "Tom is poor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom can not afford beef. (B) He bought cleanser essence for treatment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom can not afford beef.\nExplanation: Being poor means having limited financial resources. As a result, Tom may not be able to afford certain things, such as expensive food items like beef. Option B, buying cleanser essence for treatment, does not necessarily follow from the fact that Tom is poor."}}
{"Q": "Jim put some water in the beaker and left them on the table for a long time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found the water became sweeter. (B) He found the volume of water decreased.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When water is left out for a long time, it can evaporate, causing the volume of water to decrease. There is no scientific reason for water to become sweeter just by being left out on a table."}}
{"Q": "He raises a lot of lambs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's family grows a lot of grapevines. (B) Tom opened a sweater factory.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom's family grows a lot of grapevines.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tom's family is involved in agriculture and animal husbandry, which would explain why he raises a lot of lambs. Option B, which suggests that Tom opened a sweater factory, is not related to raising lambs."}}
{"Q": "Designers desire to increase availability. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Designers bought a new clover. (B) Productivity was increased.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Productivity was increased.\nExplanation: Designers increasing availability means that they want their products to be more easily accessible to consumers. To achieve this, they may increase production or streamline their supply chain to ensure that their products are always in stock. This would lead to an increase in productivity as more products are being produced and made available to consumers. Buying a new clover (choice A) does not make sense in this context and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom intakes weak type iii collagen by eating muscles. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One of Tom's llimbs had stong Muscles. (B) Muscles contain plenty of fibroblasts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Muscles contain plenty of fibroblasts, which are responsible for producing collagen. Type III collagen is a weaker form of collagen that is found in tissues undergoing remodeling or repair. Therefore, it is plausible that Tom is ingesting weak type III collagen by eating muscles that contain fibroblasts producing this type of collagen during the remodeling or repair process. Option A is not a plausible explanation as the strength of Tom's limbs does not directly relate to the type of collagen he is ingesting."}}
{"Q": "Socrates is a philosopher and a great man. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Socrates dies for his value and belief. (B) Many readers thus consider him an excellent philosopher.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Socrates was sentenced to death by drinking hemlock for his philosophical beliefs and teachings. This event is well-documented in history and is a significant part of Socrates' legacy. While it is true that many readers consider him an excellent philosopher, this is not a direct result of his being a philosopher and a great man."}}
{"Q": "The attendants ends their relationships. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The meeting ends. (B) Lucy and Tom are not ready for the coming of a baby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The reason for the attendants ending their relationships is most likely due to Lucy and Tom not being ready for the coming of a baby. This is a more plausible answer as it involves a significant life event that could cause stress and strain on a relationship. The meeting ending alone would not be a strong enough reason for multiple relationships to end."}}
{"Q": "He bought a lot of berries. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor advised him to eat more fruits containing potassium. (B) Tom wants to eat some fruits with starch.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The doctor advising him to eat more fruits containing potassium is a more plausible reason for buying a lot of berries than Tom wanting to eat fruits with starch. Berries are known to be a good source of potassium, which is essential for maintaining good health. Therefore, it is more likely that the man bought a lot of berries because his doctor advised him to eat more fruits containing potassium."}}
{"Q": "There is an apple on the ground. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sloth bent his hands and picked up the apple. (B) The exposed part of the apple turned yellow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option A is not plausible as sloths are arboreal animals and are not known to be found on the ground. Option B is more plausible as apples turn yellow as they ripen and are exposed to sunlight."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has been injected with the pseudoephedrine. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her baby in the belly was checked with pseudoephedrine. (B) Her self-esteem is profoundly impacted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her baby in the belly was checked with pseudoephedrine.\nExplanation: Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that is commonly used to relieve nasal congestion. However, it is not safe to use during pregnancy as it can cause harm to the developing fetus. Therefore, if Lucy has been injected with pseudoephedrine, it is likely that her baby in the belly was checked for any potential harm caused by the drug. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which does not have any logical connection to the use of pseudoephedrine."}}
{"Q": "Finally he decided to choose iridium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He needed a hard brittle lustrous dense transition metal of the platinum family. (B) Qualcomm Company has applied for many patents.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that he decided to choose iridium, and the reason given is that he needed a hard brittle lustrous dense transition metal of the platinum family. This suggests that he chose iridium based on its physical properties and its classification as a platinum group metal, rather than any external factors such as Qualcomm's patent applications. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "An argali appeared in front of the hunter. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hunter followed it to find more of them. (B) Her eyes accomodated to the new distance to the object.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: When an object suddenly appears in front of someone, their eyes need to adjust to the new distance to the object. This is known as accommodation. It is unlikely that the hunter would immediately follow the argali without assessing the situation and considering the potential risks and benefits."}}
{"Q": "Jack sat on the wheelchair instead of lying on the bed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He escaped from confinement to the bed. (B) Jack fell down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Jack sat on the wheelchair instead of lying on the bed, which implies that he was previously confined to the bed. Therefore, it is more plausible that he escaped from confinement to the bed rather than falling down."}}
{"Q": "Raspberries can be seen here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are aralias in this forest. (B) This garden contains all plants of rose family.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This garden contains all plants of rose family.\nExplanation: Raspberries belong to the rose family, and therefore it is more plausible that they are present in a garden that contains all plants of the rose family rather than being present in a forest with aralias."}}
{"Q": "I desired to make a difference in our class. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He eats a lot of eggplants. (B) I had ambitions in class.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: If someone desires to make a difference in their class, it means they have ambitions and goals to improve the class in some way. Option A about eating eggplants is completely unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "The doctor asks Rose to discontinuate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The nurse asked the doctor for barbiturates. (B) Rose is trying ovulate to get pregnant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The doctor asking Rose to discontinue is likely related to her trying to ovulate to get pregnant. Certain medications, including some fertility drugs, can interfere with the effectiveness of other medications or cause adverse effects. Therefore, the doctor may have asked Rose to discontinue certain medications to avoid any potential complications or risks to her health or pregnancy. The nurse asking for barbiturates is not related to Rose's situation and is therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "They set a herd of turtles free on the beach. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The turtles ran out to sea. (B) The turtles died on the beach.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The turtles ran out to sea.\nExplanation: Turtles are aquatic animals and their natural habitat is the ocean. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would head towards the sea when released on the beach. It is unlikely that they would die on the beach unless there were other factors such as pollution or predators present."}}
{"Q": "He knew there was more in it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John found lice in his hair. (B) Edward walked on the road and was hit by a small stone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Edward walked on the road and was hit by a small stone.\nExplanation: The cause of knowing there was more in it is not related to finding lice in one's hair. On the other hand, being hit by a small stone while walking on the road could lead to a realization that there is more to the situation, such as the possibility of danger or the need to be more aware of one's surroundings. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This experiment requires an extremely inert chemical resisting even the action of aqua regia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher provided them with iridium. (B) The scientific community calls this effect hazards.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The teacher provided them with iridium.\nExplanation: Iridium is known for its extreme inertness and resistance to corrosion, even by aqua regia. Therefore, it would be a suitable choice for an experiment that requires such a chemical. Option B is not a plausible answer as the term \"hazards\" does not make sense in the context of the given information."}}
{"Q": "These hyacinths are making their nests. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have found a new land. (B) They are enlarging holes in trees.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They are enlarging holes in trees.\nExplanation: Hyacinths are birds that typically nest in tree cavities or holes. Therefore, it is more plausible that they are enlarging holes in trees to make their nests rather than finding a new land."}}
{"Q": "They perched on the tree ahead. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A flock of cuckoos flew in the distance. (B) The villagers started from the easiest fruit trees to grow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the birds perched on the tree ahead because of something related to the tree. Option A, which talks about cuckoos flying in the distance, does not provide any connection to the tree. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that the birds perched on the tree because it was one of the easiest fruit trees to grow, and therefore, it was likely to have fruits that the birds could eat. This explanation is more plausible and logical."}}
{"Q": "NO mass were measured in the two bodies. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The inner ceramic magnets were out. (B) There is no grativity then.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If no mass was measured in the two bodies, it means that there is no gravitational force acting between them. This is because gravity is a force that is dependent on the mass of the objects involved. Therefore, choice B is the more plausible answer. Choice A, on the other hand, does not make sense in this context as the presence or absence of inner ceramic magnets would not affect the measurement of mass."}}
{"Q": "Mike wanted to take some pictures of the jackrabbits. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The most impressed was the beautiful but different heads they have. (B) Mike waited under a mix of shrubs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Mike waited under a mix of shrubs to take pictures of the jackrabbits. Option A talks about the heads of the jackrabbits, which is not mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is allergic to beef. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The examination showed that he had taken a large amount of ephedrine. (B) Tom never eats burgers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Tom is allergic to beef, it is more plausible that he avoids eating burgers or any other beef products rather than taking a large amount of ephedrine, which is not related to his allergy."}}
{"Q": "The economic fluctuation was rising. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The enemies were so strong. (B) More and more people made contributions in the development of economy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The increase in economic fluctuation is more likely to be caused by more people contributing to the development of the economy, rather than the strength of enemies. When more people are involved in economic activities, there is more production, consumption, and investment, which can lead to economic growth and fluctuations."}}
{"Q": "They went to the church for prays. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The patients was in the process of the treatment. (B) Villagers suffered painful life when there was a heavy flood in the village.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Going to church for prayers is a common practice during times of hardship or disaster. The mention of a heavy flood in the village suggests that the villagers were suffering and seeking solace in prayer. Option A, which mentions patients in the process of treatment, does not seem to be a likely cause for going to church for prayers."}}
{"Q": "Tom hated his neighbor for a long time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The jeweler wanted to sell Tom. (B) He beat up his neighbor violently.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He beat up his neighbor violently.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's hatred for his neighbor would lead to a violent confrontation rather than a jeweler wanting to sell him."}}
{"Q": "Adequate nutrients were provided for his body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fat in his body has decreased. (B) The synthesis processes were normal in his body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The synthesis processes were normal in his body.\nExplanation: Adequate nutrients provide the necessary building blocks for the body to carry out its normal synthesis processes, such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, and cell division. This ensures that the body functions properly and can maintain its overall health. While proper nutrition can contribute to weight loss, it is not the only factor and cannot guarantee a decrease in body fat. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is not very clear about one point in class. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He turned to the assistants for explaination. (B) Tom's teacher ask him to reread the textbook.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He turned to the assistants for explanation.\nExplanation: Since Tom is not clear about a point in class, it is more plausible that he would turn to the assistants for clarification rather than the teacher asking him to reread the textbook. The assistants are there to help students understand the material and answer any questions they may have, so it makes sense for Tom to seek their assistance."}}
{"Q": "Lucy is a secretary of the chairman of the famous factory. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She enjoys the right of having a rest at weekends. (B) There is no doubt that he loves her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She enjoys the right of having a rest at weekends.\nExplanation: Being a secretary of the chairman of a famous factory does not necessarily mean that the chairman loves her. However, it is common for employees to have weekends off, so it is plausible that Lucy enjoys the right of having a rest at weekends."}}
{"Q": "She went to the zoo. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sheep still need to be outdoors in winter. (B) Mary wanted to see giraffes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Mary wanted to see giraffes, as going to the zoo is a common activity for people who want to see animals. Choice A, that sheep still need to be outdoors in winter, is not a likely reason for someone to go to the zoo."}}
{"Q": "The boss wants the building to be more stable. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He took use of slabs. (B) He chose a place with adequate sunlight and good air circulation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He took use of slabs.\nExplanation: Using slabs is a common method to increase the stability of a building. Slabs are large, flat pieces of concrete or other materials that are placed on top of the foundation to distribute the weight of the building more evenly. This can help prevent the building from shifting or settling over time, making it more stable. Choosing a place with adequate sunlight and good air circulation may be important for other reasons, such as improving the comfort of the occupants or reducing energy costs, but it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stability of the building."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a student majoring in the paleozoology. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He mainly studies about fossil remains of animals. (B) He used a telescope to look at the moons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He mainly studies about fossil remains of animals.\nExplanation: Paleozoology is the study of animal life during the Paleozoic era, which is characterized by the emergence of many animal groups and the development of hard body parts that can be preserved as fossils. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's studies would focus on the fossil remains of animals rather than using a telescope to look at moons, which is more related to astronomy."}}
{"Q": "Tom was bitten by a viper in the wild. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The venom gradually spreads in Tom's body. (B) Tom had edema and erythema on his arm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The venom gradually spreads in Tom's body.\nExplanation: When bitten by a venomous snake like a viper, the venom can quickly spread through the bloodstream and affect various organs and systems in the body. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, difficulty breathing, and even paralysis. Edema and erythema on the arm may also occur, but the more serious and life-threatening consequence is the spread of venom throughout the body. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to be the winner in the Olympic Games. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was injected with some depressants. (B) He is not restricted in his exercise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom is not restricted in his exercise as he wants to be the winner in the Olympic Games. Being injected with depressants would hinder his performance and decrease his chances of winning."}}
{"Q": "He finally has something wrong with his airway. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's bone behind the toe was protruding. (B) Tom took no medicine to cure his fever.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of an airway problem is more likely to be related to a respiratory illness or infection, which could have been the cause of Tom's fever. A bone protruding behind the toe would not have a direct impact on the airway."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has taken a lot of antidepressants. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She found trazodone is the most effective one. (B) Their children are all over the country.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She found trazodone is the most effective one.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Lucy has taken a lot of antidepressants, which implies that she has been struggling with depression. The second option, \"Their children are all over the country,\" does not seem to be related to the information given in the sentence. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that Lucy has tried different antidepressants and found that trazodone is the most effective one for her."}}
{"Q": "Rum's car was damaged. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rum changed to a new car. (B) Rum's repairman said it was a normal usage loss.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that Rum took the damaged car to a repairman who assessed the damage and determined it was a normal usage loss, rather than Rum immediately changing to a new car."}}
{"Q": "Zooplankton disappears. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It hasn't rained here for a long time in this region. (B) Tom puts the zooplankton into the big fish tank with small fish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because putting zooplankton into a fish tank with small fish would likely result in the fish eating the zooplankton, causing it to disappear. Lack of rain (choice A) may affect the water level and quality, but it would not directly cause the disappearance of zooplankton."}}
{"Q": "Biologists had observed many mammals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They found that they visited families. (B) Biologists find that there are more gibbons in resource-rich places.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Biologists finding that there are more gibbons in resource-rich places is a more plausible answer as it is a specific observation related to a particular mammal species. The statement about mammals visiting families is too general and does not provide any specific information about the behavior or characteristics of any particular mammal species."}}
{"Q": "She used the teeth of it to clear up her hair. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She bought a comb. (B) The little kangaroo feels very cold.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She bought a comb.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"she used the teeth of it to clear up her hair,\" indicating that she had a tool with teeth to comb her hair. Option A states that she bought a comb, which is a plausible explanation for why she had a tool with teeth to use on her hair. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated and does not provide a logical explanation for the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Fear clutches at his heart. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom knows he's dying. (B) Bob's mentality has changed a lot recently.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"his\" heart, indicating that the fear is being experienced by someone specific. Since the sentence does not mention Tom, it is more likely that the fear is related to Bob's recent change in mentality. Additionally, fear is a common response to changes in behavior or personality in someone close to us."}}
{"Q": "The walruses were locked in an artifitial river together. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They degenerated in this way. (B) The diver observed ther conatct under water sometimes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They degenerated in this way.\nExplanation: Keeping walruses in an artificial river is not a natural habitat for them and can lead to physical and mental deterioration. Walruses need space to swim and dive, and being confined to an artificial river can cause stress, boredom, and physical health problems. Therefore, it is more plausible that they degenerated in this way rather than the diver observing their contact under water sometimes."}}
{"Q": "Edison invented the light bulb with tungsten wire. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Edison was a foreigner. (B) Edison ruled out all kinds of unsuitable materials.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Edison ruled out all kinds of unsuitable materials.\nExplanation: Edison experimented with various materials for the filament of the light bulb, including platinum, carbon, and bamboo. However, these materials were either too expensive or burned out too quickly. Eventually, Edison discovered that tungsten had a high melting point and was durable enough to withstand the heat and electrical current required for a light bulb. Therefore, it was not because Edison was a foreigner, but rather his systematic approach to testing different materials that led to the discovery of tungsten as the ideal material for the light bulb filament."}}
{"Q": "Tom catches octopus by the sea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He failed because the octopus can always escape as fast as possible. (B) His leg was amputated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom may have failed to catch the octopus because they are known for their ability to escape quickly and easily. It is unlikely that his leg would be amputated as a result of catching an octopus."}}
{"Q": "Shoulder bones are connected together to maintain stability. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are arteries in the shoulders of the human body. (B) There are ligaments in the shoulders of the human body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Ligaments are tough, fibrous tissues that connect bones to other bones in the body. In the case of the shoulder, ligaments connect the bones of the shoulder joint together, providing stability and preventing dislocation. Arteries, on the other hand, are blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood to the tissues of the body and are not directly involved in maintaining stability of the shoulder bones. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He got pneumonia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He died of it. (B) He nearly died of oxygen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: He nearly died of oxygen.\nExplanation: Pneumonia is an infection that affects the lungs and can cause difficulty breathing. In severe cases, patients may require oxygen therapy to help them breathe. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person nearly died of oxygen deprivation rather than dying directly from the pneumonia itself."}}
{"Q": "They spent a long time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was going out for a date with his girlfriend at five in the evening on Christmas day. (B) This group of Pythons began to travel for their immigrant destination.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. This group of Pythons began to travel for their immigrant destination.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible as it suggests a reason for a group of people to spend a long time traveling. On the other hand, option A only provides information about Tom's plans for a date, which may not necessarily require a long time."}}
{"Q": "The farmer grows celeries. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He knows its property very well. (B) He got carrots this year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He knows its property very well.\nExplanation: Since the farmer grows celeries, it is likely that he has gained knowledge and experience in cultivating this crop. Therefore, it is more plausible that he knows its property very well rather than getting carrots this year, which is unrelated to the given information."}}
{"Q": "When it was over, the water was still clear. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy rotated the tap. (B) The keeper bathed the gerbil in water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the keeper bathed the gerbil in water. If Lucy had rotated the tap, the water would have been running and not clear after the activity. However, if the keeper bathed the gerbil in water, they would have used a small amount of water, which would not have affected the clarity of the water."}}
{"Q": "He stole their preys before they came back. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hungry theif came to a village of fishers. (B) The hungry theif came to a forest of snakes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The hungry thief came to a village of fishers.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the theft of preys. If the thief came to a forest of snakes, it is unlikely that the snakes would have preys that the thief could steal. On the other hand, if the thief came to a village of fishers, it is more likely that there would be preys such as fish that the thief could steal."}}
{"Q": "A leopard fur garment needs to sacrifice countless leopards. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bought a lot of cocoa beans. (B) Environmental experts call for a ban on leopard fur.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Environmental experts call for a ban on leopard fur.\nExplanation: The use of leopard fur in garments requires the killing of numerous leopards, which can lead to a decline in their population and endangerment of the species. As a result, environmental experts may call for a ban on the use of leopard fur to protect the species and prevent further harm to the environment. Buying cocoa beans is not related to the issue of leopard fur garments."}}
{"Q": "Amy wants to wash the car with water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The butcher needs to wash them away with a lot of water. (B) She brings a long hose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She brings a long hose.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Amy's desire to wash the car with water. Bringing a long hose would make it easier for her to reach all parts of the car and ensure that it is thoroughly cleaned. Choice (A) is not a logical result of Amy wanting to wash the car with water and seems unrelated."}}
{"Q": "The interfaces of biological systems were destroyed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Part of the nutrients in the patient's body were depleted. (B) The alien's destruction plan starts from the essential structures in biological systems.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The destruction of interfaces in biological systems is a deliberate act, as indicated by the phrase \"the alien's destruction plan.\" Choice (A) suggests a natural cause, such as malnutrition, which is not supported by the given information. Therefore, choice (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Only Tom attributed all to lumber. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is the only one who considered the free existence of things. (B) He got some alloys.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He is the only one who considered the free existence of things.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that Tom had a unique perspective on the source of everything, attributing it all to lumber. This suggests that he saw the interconnectedness of things and recognized the importance of natural resources. The fact that he is the only one who did so implies that others may have overlooked this perspective or had different beliefs about the origins of things. The option of him getting alloys seems unrelated and unlikely based on the given information."}}
{"Q": "They firstly measured the covering area of the sun. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The scientists made observations of the sunspots. (B) Scientists wants to measure the illuminance of the sun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Scientists often measure the covering area of the sun to observe and study sunspots, which are dark areas on the sun's surface caused by magnetic activity. By measuring the covering area of the sun, scientists can track the movement and changes in sunspots, which can provide valuable information about the sun's magnetic field and its effects on Earth's climate and technology. Measuring the illuminance of the sun is typically done using different methods, such as photometers or radiometers, and does not require measuring the covering area of the sun."}}
{"Q": "People are afraid of snakes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Frank is fond of chewing gum and eating hard and cold things. (B) Snakes are poisonous.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Snakes are poisonous.\nExplanation: The fear of snakes is a common phobia known as ophidiophobia. This fear is often attributed to the fact that many species of snakes are venomous and can cause serious harm or even death if they bite a person. Additionally, snakes are often portrayed as dangerous and menacing in popular culture, further contributing to people's fear of them. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the potential danger associated with snakes."}}
{"Q": "The astronomer calculated the size of such a Planetesimal. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His result could be compared with the size of small moons. (B) He discovered the new world.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The astronomer's calculation of the size of the Planetesimal allowed for a comparison to be made with the size of small moons. This suggests that the astronomer did not discover a new world, but rather made a scientific observation and measurement that could be used for further study and understanding of celestial bodies."}}
{"Q": "His lupus was cured. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom took some antimalarials. (B) His vertebrate was damaged.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom took some antimalarials.\nExplanation: Antimalarials are known to be effective in treating lupus, as they can reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. While damage to the vertebrate may cause symptoms similar to lupus, it is not a known cause or treatment for the disease. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The table looked more transparent. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The maker maintained the rate of Transparency of the table's suface. (B) The maker changed the rate of Transparency of the table's suface.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The maker changed the rate of Transparency of the table's surface.\nExplanation: If the table looked more transparent, it means that the rate of transparency of its surface increased. This could have been achieved by changing the material or finish of the table's surface, or by applying a coating or treatment that increased its transparency. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) suggests that the transparency rate remained the same, which does not explain why the table looked more transparent."}}
{"Q": "These gooseberries grow better. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gigi has cultivated gooseberries under good conditions. (B) I have some seedlings in my garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the gooseberries grew better than others, indicating that they were cultivated under good conditions. Choice A directly addresses this possibility, while choice B is unrelated and does not provide a clear reason for the better growth. Therefore, choice A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The movie star asked for assistance. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His company gave him a hand. (B) He asked for help from a 3 year old child.", "R": {"text": "Answer: His company gave him a hand.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a movie star would ask for assistance from his company, which could provide him with resources and support, rather than asking for help from a 3 year old child who may not have the ability to assist him in any meaningful way."}}
{"Q": "There are a lot of creatures in the nature. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) All these creatures make up the biodiversity. (B) They play their own functions and keep the biological sphere.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. All these creatures make up the biodiversity.\nExplanation: Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms on Earth, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. The presence of a large number of different species in nature is what makes up the biodiversity. Each species has its own unique characteristics and plays a specific role in the ecosystem. For example, bees are important pollinators, while predators like lions help to control the population of herbivores. Therefore, the existence of a diverse range of creatures is essential for maintaining a healthy and balanced ecosystem."}}
{"Q": "Bobbies were in trap. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The angel gave him a hand. (B) The farmer bought pesticides to kill them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The angel gave him a hand.\nExplanation: This question is incomplete and lacks context, but assuming that \"bobbies\" refers to insects or pests, it is more plausible that an angel would intervene to help rather than a farmer resorting to buying pesticides. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "Lisa's battery capacity is too small. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Father does some activations on her battery. (B) Lisa was diagnosed with diabetes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that Lisa's battery capacity is not sufficient, which implies that her battery is not functioning properly. Therefore, it is more plausible that her father would do some activations on her battery to fix the issue rather than Lisa being diagnosed with diabetes, which is unrelated to the context."}}
{"Q": "A bat entered our theater. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It hanged on the wall. (B) It hanged on the floor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It hanged on the wall.\nExplanation: Bats are known to roost or hang upside down from ceilings or walls. It is unlikely for a bat to hang on the floor as it would make it vulnerable to predators and unable to take off for flight. Therefore, it is more plausible that the bat entered the theater and found a spot to hang on the wall."}}
{"Q": "Tom lacks magnesium in his body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was diagnosed with the cardiovascular disease. (B) His doctor gave him ibuprofen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Magnesium deficiency can lead to cardiovascular disease as it plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy heart rhythm and blood pressure. Ibuprofen is a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory drug and is not related to magnesium deficiency."}}
{"Q": "They easily damage their spines. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dachshunds have short backs. (B) Dachshunds have long backs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Dachshunds have long backs.\nExplanation: Dachshunds have a genetic predisposition to having longer backs than other dog breeds. This puts them at a higher risk for spinal injuries and disc problems, such as intervertebral disc disease. Their long backs make them more susceptible to spinal cord injuries from jumping, running, or even just playing too rough. Therefore, it is more plausible that their long backs are the cause of their spinal issues rather than their backs being short."}}
{"Q": "The students found some bone-like structures in the polyps. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They built nests with the materials they found. (B) The teacher told them it was called the spicules.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that the teacher told them it was called the spicules. This is because spicules are actually small, needle-like structures made of calcium carbonate or silica that are found in the skeletons of some marine animals, including polyps. It is unlikely that the students would have built nests with the bone-like structures they found, as they would not have been suitable for this purpose."}}
{"Q": "The child was admitted to the hospital because he drank gasoline by mistake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Doctors feel thorny in detoxifying marijuana. (B) Doctors feel thorny in detoxifying mixed chemicals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The child drank gasoline, which is a toxic chemical. Therefore, doctors would feel thorny in detoxifying mixed chemicals, as gasoline is a mixture of various chemicals. Detoxifying marijuana is not relevant to this scenario."}}
{"Q": "He died soon after. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kimi was wounded by the enemy. (B) He took opium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that he died soon after suggests that the cause of death was sudden and unexpected. While it is possible that Kimi was wounded by the enemy, this would likely have been mentioned explicitly in the text if it were the case. On the other hand, the mention of opium suggests that Kimi may have taken it and died as a result. This is a more plausible explanation given the information provided."}}
{"Q": "Tom can't master division. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His mother is angry at his not mastering fundamental operation of arithmetic. (B) He could design one of minimalism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's mother would be frustrated or disappointed with his inability to master a fundamental operation of arithmetic, rather than him suddenly becoming a designer of minimalism."}}
{"Q": "There was a swan in the office. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The official got the beautiful feather. (B) The poor actress can not hear anything because of the noise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The official got the beautiful feather.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the swan was captured and its feather was taken by the official for its beauty. The option of the actress being unable to hear anything due to the noise does not make sense as swans are not known for making loud noises."}}
{"Q": "Tom saw himself in the mirror. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has put a mirror under the sun. (B) Baby Tom looked into the mirror.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Baby Tom looked into the mirror.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom saw himself in the mirror because he looked into it, rather than him putting a mirror under the sun which would not necessarily result in him seeing his reflection."}}
{"Q": "The coin is attracted by the magnet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack holds the iron sheet close to the magnetite. (B) Jane held the magnet close to the coin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Jane held the magnet close to the coin, as magnets have the ability to attract certain metals, such as iron and nickel. The fact that the coin was attracted to the magnet suggests that it contains one of these metals. Option A, where Jack holds the iron sheet close to the magnetite, is not a likely cause as it does not explain why the coin was attracted to the magnet."}}
{"Q": "He went to church to be baptized. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack wants to join Christianity. (B) Another case of sudden death occurred.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jack wants to join Christianity.\nExplanation: The act of baptism is a common practice in Christianity, where a person is immersed in water or has water poured over them as a symbol of their faith and commitment to the religion. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack went to church to be baptized because he wants to join Christianity rather than because of another sudden death occurring."}}
{"Q": "We were killed by nuclear weapons. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Missles were used to attack us. (B) The decay of uranium didn't stop.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Missiles were used to attack us.\nExplanation: Nuclear weapons are typically delivered through missiles or bombs. The explosion is caused by a chain reaction of nuclear fission, which releases a massive amount of energy. The decay of uranium alone would not cause a nuclear explosion. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of our death was due to a missile attack."}}
{"Q": "They found that they can grow to eight inches long. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They studied the components of poinsettias. (B) They studied the features of leech.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They studied the features of leech.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions the length of something, which suggests that the researchers were studying a living organism. The only option that mentions studying a living organism is B, where they studied the features of a leech. Therefore, it is more plausible that the researchers found that something can grow to eight inches long by studying the features of a leech."}}
{"Q": "The staff in this hotel are well-trained in this hotel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They can offer the guests with good service. (B) Many workers are toxicated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If the staff in the hotel are well-trained, it means they have the necessary skills and knowledge to provide good service to the guests. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is unlikely as it suggests that many workers are intoxicated, which would negatively impact their ability to provide good service."}}
{"Q": "Mike prepared enough proteins for them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mike kept several poodles. (B) They are getting married today.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that they are getting married today suggests that there will be a celebration or event where food will be served, and Mike has prepared enough proteins for the occasion. The information about Mike keeping several poodles is irrelevant and does not provide a logical explanation for why he prepared enough proteins."}}
{"Q": "They learn a lot from each other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom and Maria are good friends. (B) The teacher provided them with a variety of pedons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that Tom and Maria are learning from each other, which implies that they have a good relationship and are able to share knowledge and ideas. Option B, on the other hand, talks about the teacher providing them with pedons, which may contribute to their learning but is not the main cause of them learning from each other. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was in poor health. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has burdens. (B) Tom had terrible acne these days.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom has burdens.\nExplanation: Poor health is often caused by stress and other burdens on the body, such as financial problems, relationship issues, or work-related stress. Terrible acne may affect one's self-esteem, but it is unlikely to cause poor overall health. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The tetrapods' tooth is romoved. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The tetrapod can't ea now. (B) It can get nourishment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It can get nourishment.\nExplanation: While teeth are important for chewing and breaking down food, tetrapods have other ways of obtaining nourishment such as swallowing food whole or using their jaws to crush and grind food. Therefore, the removal of teeth would not necessarily prevent the tetrapod from getting nourishment."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to the eastern United States. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom had a visit of Indiana. (B) He saw a lot of dogwoods.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He saw a lot of dogwoods.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because dogwoods are a common tree in the eastern United States, particularly in states like Virginia and North Carolina. Indiana is also in the eastern United States, but it is not necessarily a notable destination or attraction for someone visiting the region."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to his vegetable shed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He saw a lot of aphids. (B) Some people learned how to make beers with top fermenting yeasts from him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The sentence only mentions Tom going to his vegetable shed, but does not provide any information about him teaching people how to make beer with top fermenting yeasts. On the other hand, the sentence implies that something happened to Tom when he went to his vegetable shed, and seeing a lot of aphids is a more plausible outcome."}}
{"Q": "He found something sticky and stick in the bottle. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has caught an aphid in the bottle. (B) Tom has just had a wine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom had just had a wine and there was some residue left in the bottle, causing it to be sticky and sticky. It is unlikely that an aphid would cause the bottle to be sticky."}}
{"Q": "They found that they can grow to eight inches long. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They studied the features of leech. (B) Scientists conducted a series of experiments on truffles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"scientists conducted a series of experiments on truffles,\" which suggests that the experiments on truffles led to the discovery that they can grow to eight inches long. Studying the features of leeches would not necessarily provide information on their size."}}
{"Q": "They always stay in their home. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Leah has a cough and often feels like having mucus in her throat. (B) Donkeys are lazy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Leah has a cough and often feels like having mucus in her throat suggests that she may be ill or have a respiratory condition that makes it difficult for her to leave the house. This is a more plausible explanation than donkeys being lazy, which is not relevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "He doesn't have enough melanocytes in his body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has no neural crest. (B) He has albinism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He has albinism.\nExplanation: Albinism is a genetic condition that affects the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. People with albinism have a reduced number of melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin, in their body. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer than option (A), which suggests a complete absence of neural crest cells, a highly unlikely scenario as neural crest cells are essential for the development of many tissues in the body."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a talent in running. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The result showed that it was the persistence of sound in an enclosed space caused by repeated reflections. (B) He always won in various running competitions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Tom's talent in running resulted in him always winning in various running competitions. Choice (A) is unrelated to the given information and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "He felt sad about his opprobrium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher's shameful action made him disgraceful. (B) He bitterly regretted that the man had robbed him of the chance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Opprobrium means public disgrace or shame. Option A suggests that the cause of his opprobrium was the teacher's shameful action, which made him feel disgraceful. Option B talks about a man robbing him of a chance, which does not seem to be directly related to the feeling of opprobrium. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He was so tired that he fell asleep. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom was going out for a date with his girlfriend at five in the evening on Christmas day. (B) Tom spent the morning washing clothes and cleaning the room.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom spent the morning washing clothes and cleaning the room.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom's tiredness was caused by his physical activity of washing clothes and cleaning the room, rather than going out for a date with his girlfriend in the evening. Physical activity can cause fatigue and exhaustion, leading to falling asleep."}}
{"Q": "The pincers scratched her finger. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor is going to give her fluids. (B) Melinda went down to the pond to catch crabs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Melinda went down to the pond to catch crabs.\nExplanation: The word \"pincers\" suggests that the scratch was caused by a crab, which is consistent with choice (B) where Melinda went down to the pond to catch crabs. Choice (A) about the doctor giving her fluids is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for the cause of the scratch."}}
{"Q": "Tom often faces the problem of anxiety. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom can't breathe normally. (B) It is a prominent natural state of  his nature.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, and chest tightness, which can make it difficult to breathe normally. While anxiety may be a natural state for some individuals, it is not necessarily a prominent or universal trait for everyone who experiences it."}}
{"Q": "The residents here decided to migrate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The climate here became more and more severe. (B) The residents of this tropical town can't stand the wet weather.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The climate here became more and more severe.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible as it suggests a gradual change in the climate that made it difficult for the residents to continue living in the area. Option B, on the other hand, seems unlikely as tropical towns are known for their wet weather and it is unlikely that the residents would suddenly become unable to tolerate it."}}
{"Q": "Tommy hopes that azaleas will thrive. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The gardener instructs him to transplant the flowers under the shade of the tree. (B) The gardener instructs him to transplant the flowers under the sun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The gardener instructs him to transplant the flowers under the shade of the tree.\nExplanation: Azaleas prefer partial shade and well-drained soil. Transplanting them under the shade of a tree will provide the necessary conditions for them to thrive. Transplanting them under the sun may cause them to wilt and die due to excessive heat and lack of shade."}}
{"Q": "He measured the diameter and bought a new  proper tyre. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike was not satisfied with the plasticine in a rim. (B) Tom's car tyre got punctured.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom's car tyre got punctured, which led him to measure the diameter and buy a new proper tyre. If Mike was not satisfied with the plasticine in a rim, he would have replaced it instead of buying a new tyre. Therefore, option B is the most logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "He eats something containing peppermints. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's sphincters are extremely nervous. (B) He is sleepy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He is sleepy.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom ate something containing peppermints to help him stay awake or combat drowsiness, as peppermint is known to have a stimulating effect on the senses. Option (A) about Tom's sphincters being nervous is not a likely cause for him to eat peppermints."}}
{"Q": "I cannot get connected to the internet at a high speed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This area is current-free. (B) Ethernet was interrupted on my computer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Ethernet was interrupted on my computer.\nExplanation: If the internet connection is slow, it is more likely that there is an interruption in the Ethernet connection on the computer. This can be caused by a faulty Ethernet cable, a loose connection, or a problem with the network adapter. It is less likely that the area is current-free as this would affect all devices in the area, not just one computer."}}
{"Q": "They are classified in the low toxicity zone. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John went to the shop to pick up surfactants. (B) The scientist testing lipoproteins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The scientist testing lipoproteins.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that \"they\" (presumably some chemicals or substances) are classified in the low toxicity zone. The most plausible reason for this classification would be the testing and evaluation of these substances by a scientist, rather than John going to the shop to pick up surfactants, which is unrelated to toxicity classification. Therefore, the cause of the low toxicity classification is likely the work of the scientist testing lipoproteins."}}
{"Q": "Jack committed carjacking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This general intent crime analogous to robbery put him into jail. (B) Colleagues opened the window for him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. This general intent crime analogous to robbery put him into jail.\nExplanation: Carjacking is a serious crime that involves the use of force or intimidation to steal a car from its owner. It is considered a felony offense and can result in imprisonment. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack was arrested and sent to jail for committing carjacking. Option B, where colleagues opened the window for him, is not related to the crime and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Tom lacks ketones in his blood. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His blood flow is not as improved as others with normal ketones level. (B) His blood flow is as improved as others with normal ketones level.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Ketones are produced by the liver when the body is in a state of ketosis, which occurs when there is a lack of glucose in the body. Ketones are used as an alternative source of energy for the body, particularly the brain. Without ketones, Tom's body may not be able to efficiently produce energy, which could lead to decreased blood flow and other negative effects. Therefore, it is more plausible that his blood flow is not as improved as others with normal ketones level."}}
{"Q": "Junipers grow everywhere in the village. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The village has a great production in vegetables. (B) It is well-drained in the village.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Junipers are known to thrive in well-drained soil and can tolerate dry conditions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the abundance of junipers in the village is due to the well-drained soil rather than the production of vegetables."}}
{"Q": "Susan took a glass of soda and put it on the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After a few days, the soda water lost its carbonation. (B) The carbonization of soda remains after a long time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Over time, carbon dioxide gas in soda will escape into the air, causing the soda to lose its carbonation and become flat. This process can happen relatively quickly, within a few days, especially if the soda is left uncovered or in a warm environment. Therefore, it is more plausible that after a few days, the soda water lost its carbonation. Option B is less likely because carbonation can eventually dissipate over time, even if it takes a while."}}
{"Q": "Tom's knee joints were hurt in a car accident. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor judged him to have a mild concussion. (B) He couldn't move his legs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: He couldn't move his legs.\nExplanation: Knee joint injuries can cause difficulty in movement and can even lead to temporary or permanent paralysis of the legs. A mild concussion is a head injury and is not directly related to knee joint injuries. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I told him they could only measure wind speed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim recently bought a gyroscope. (B) I saw Jane use anemometers to test wind direction.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Anemometers are instruments used to measure wind speed and direction, while gyroscopes are used to measure orientation and angular velocity. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the measurement of wind speed."}}
{"Q": "He found a leech crawling up his leg. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom farted in class. (B) Kevin went swimming in a small river.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Kevin went swimming in a small river.\nExplanation: Leeches are commonly found in freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. They attach themselves to the skin of animals and humans to feed on their blood. Therefore, it is more plausible that Kevin picked up the leech while swimming in a small river rather than Tom's fart causing a leech to crawl up his leg."}}
{"Q": "The customer were very satisfied. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The product has high utility. (B) The staff conveyed the new ideas they came up with to the customers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The product has high utility.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the customers were satisfied, which indicates that they found the product useful and met their needs. Therefore, it is more plausible that the high utility of the product was the cause of customer satisfaction rather than the staff conveying new ideas."}}
{"Q": "He needs to know the degrees of arc. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John wanted to measure the declinatio. (B) John wants to measure the mention body temperature.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Measuring the degrees of arc is typically used in astronomy to measure the declination of celestial objects. Therefore, it is more plausible that John wanted to measure the declination rather than the body temperature of a person or animal."}}
{"Q": "Anacondas opened their jaws extremely wide. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They went out to find food. (B) Anacondas swallowed their victims whole.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Anacondas swallowed their victims whole.\nExplanation: Anacondas are known for their ability to swallow prey whole, and their wide jaws allow them to do so. Going out to find food is not a direct result of opening their jaws wide."}}
{"Q": "It results in particular problems in their minds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are learning the science of computation. (B) People's reading got fragmentation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that there are problems in the minds of people, and the cause of this is given as \"fragmentation\" in people's reading. Option A, which talks about learning the science of computation, is not related to the sentence and can be eliminated. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom questioned various beliefs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy was invited to talk about her belief. (B) Tom believes in heresy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Lucy was invited to talk about her belief suggests that Tom was questioning various beliefs as a result of being exposed to different perspectives and ideas. It is more plausible than option B, which suggests that Tom already holds a belief in heresy and is actively questioning other beliefs."}}
{"Q": "Tom has suffered from the disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) In the late period, sclerosis was manifested on Tom. (B) It's getting rotten.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. In the late period, sclerosis was manifested on Tom.\nExplanation: Sclerosis is a medical condition that involves hardening or thickening of body tissues. It is a common symptom of many diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's disease progressed to a late stage where sclerosis was manifested, rather than the vague and unlikely statement that \"it's getting rotten.\""}}
{"Q": "Jack eats a lot of green vegetables. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He became healthier. (B) His digestion is very smooth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He became healthier.\nExplanation: Green vegetables are known to be rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which are essential for maintaining good health. By eating a lot of green vegetables, Jack would have improved his overall health and well-being, as well as reducing the risk of various diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. While it is possible that his digestion may have improved as a result of eating more fiber, the most plausible answer is that he became healthier overall."}}
{"Q": "John bought a thermometer and put it the room. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John wanted to monitor the temperature of the room where he planted mushrooms. (B) John wanted to keep the room where he planted mushroom moist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that John planted mushrooms in the room suggests that he is interested in growing them. Monitoring the temperature is important for the growth of mushrooms, as they require specific temperature ranges to thrive. Therefore, it is more plausible that John bought the thermometer to monitor the temperature of the room where he planted mushrooms. Option B, on the other hand, does not explain why John would need a thermometer."}}
{"Q": "Alice's baby was always drinking a kind milk which consists of nitrates. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The baby was suffered the blue-baby syndrome. (B) Her baby was healthy when she grew up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Nitrates can cause methemoglobinemia, also known as blue-baby syndrome, in infants. This condition reduces the amount of oxygen that can be carried in the blood, leading to a bluish tint in the skin and lips, difficulty breathing, and other symptoms. Therefore, it is more plausible that Alice's baby suffered from blue-baby syndrome due to the nitrates in the milk."}}
{"Q": "He looked at trilobites. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found these leaves are slippery. (B) He saw spines on them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He saw spines on them.\nExplanation: The sentence states that he looked at trilobites, which are extinct marine arthropods, and does not mention anything about leaves or slipperiness. However, trilobites are known to have spines on their bodies, so it is more plausible that he saw spines on them as a result of looking at them."}}
{"Q": "Tom was very drunk last night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom becomes more outgoing. (B) Tom is having a hangover.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom is having a hangover.\nExplanation: When someone is very drunk, it is likely that they will experience a hangover the next day. Hangovers can cause symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and fatigue. While some people may become more outgoing when they are drunk, this is not a guaranteed result and is not as likely as experiencing a hangover."}}
{"Q": "She knows its lineages. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lila loves classification of her things. (B) The old witch protects everything of  the tree of life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement \"She knows its lineages\" suggests that Lila has a keen interest in classifying things, which is supported by choice A. On the other hand, choice B seems unrelated to the statement and does not provide a plausible explanation for why Lila knows the lineages. Therefore, choice A is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "The fish was captured by the peregrine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fish was caught by an otter. (B) Peregrine had an eye on a fish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Peregrines are known for their exceptional eyesight and hunting skills. It is more plausible that the peregrine spotted the fish and captured it rather than the fish being caught by an otter and then taken by the peregrine."}}
{"Q": "I don't like the smell of onions. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I don't like the smell of scallions. (B) I never eat foods containing onions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I never eat foods containing onions.\nExplanation: If someone doesn't like the smell of onions, it is likely that they also don't enjoy the taste of onions. Therefore, it is plausible that they would avoid eating foods containing onions altogether. On the other hand, scallions have a milder flavor and aroma compared to onions, so it is not necessarily true that someone who dislikes the smell of onions would also dislike the smell of scallions."}}
{"Q": "The fungicides play out different levels of activity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Doctors use fungicides to counter the spread of cancer cells. (B) Doctors use fungicides to deal with different diseases.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Fungicides are used to control or eliminate fungal diseases in plants, animals, and humans. Different fungicides have varying levels of activity depending on their chemical composition and mode of action. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it relates to the use of fungicides in dealing with different diseases caused by fungi. Option A is incorrect as fungicides are not used to counter the spread of cancer cells."}}
{"Q": "The salt dissappeared. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom poured some salt in the sands. (B) Tom poured some salt in the water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tom poured salt in the water, it would dissolve and become invisible to the naked eye. On the other hand, if he poured salt in the sand, it would still be visible and present in the sand. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His father prevented him in time which saved a lot of food in another sense. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack ingested glycerin by mistake. (B) Tom carelessly seeded oats in the autumn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the potential loss of food is not mentioned in the question, but option B suggests that Tom's careless seeding of oats in the autumn could have led to a poor harvest and less food. However, his father prevented him in time, which saved a lot of food in another sense. Option A, on the other hand, is not related to the context of the question and seems unlikely."}}
{"Q": "His father organized the whole family to travel. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wants to see a lot of zebras. (B) Tom is busy with exams recently so he is very nervous.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Tom is busy with exams and nervous suggests that the family may be going on a trip to help him relax and take a break from his studies. Option A, on the other hand, seems unlikely as it is not a strong enough reason to organize a whole family trip."}}
{"Q": "Tom has eaten something containing starches. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His blood sugar has risen. (B) He suffered from gastrointestinal trouble.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His blood sugar has risen.\nExplanation: Starches are complex carbohydrates that are broken down into glucose during digestion. Glucose is then absorbed into the bloodstream, causing an increase in blood sugar levels. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's blood sugar has risen after consuming something containing starches. Gastrointestinal trouble may occur if Tom has a sensitivity or intolerance to certain types of starches, but it is not a guaranteed result of consuming starches."}}
{"Q": "The government only protected the property of the rich and had no concern for the individual rights of ordinary people. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The people overthrew the government by election. (B) Laterly the residents felt the falling of drizzle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The people overthrew the government by election.\nExplanation: When a government only protects the property of the rich and ignores the rights of ordinary people, it creates a sense of injustice and inequality. This can lead to widespread dissatisfaction and unrest among the population, which can ultimately result in the overthrow of the government through democratic means such as elections. This has happened in many countries throughout history, where governments that were seen as corrupt or unjust were voted out of power by the people."}}
{"Q": "The family provided a bed for their pet dog. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The dog can insulate itself from the cold ground. (B) The puppy grows up happily under careful care.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The dog can insulate itself from the cold ground.\nExplanation: Providing a bed for the pet dog allows it to have a comfortable and warm place to sleep, which can help insulate it from the cold ground. This can be especially important during colder months or in areas with colder climates. While providing a bed may also contribute to the puppy's happiness and well-being, option A is a more direct and likely result of providing a bed for the dog."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes eating a lot of turnips. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His child is also good at learning English. (B) He was filled with vitamins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Eating a lot of turnips would result in Tom being filled with vitamins, as turnips are a good source of vitamins such as vitamin C, vitamin K, and folate. There is no logical connection between Tom's turnip consumption and his child's English proficiency."}}
{"Q": "Their enemies' signal disturbed radio frequency waves. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Our ground penetrating radar detected subsurface features as usual. (B) Our ground penetrating radar failed to detect subsurface features.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Our ground penetrating radar failed to detect subsurface features.\nExplanation: The disturbance of radio frequency waves caused by the enemies' signal would likely interfere with the functioning of our ground penetrating radar, which relies on radio waves to detect subsurface features. Therefore, it is more plausible that the radar would fail to detect subsurface features rather than continue to function as usual."}}
{"Q": "I want to borrow some money. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I ran to buy unguent to treat white patches. (B) I turn to banks for help.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: If someone wants to borrow money, the most plausible option would be to turn to banks or other financial institutions for help. Running to buy unguent to treat white patches has no connection to borrowing money."}}
{"Q": "Tom graduated from university. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom needs to choose working or going abroad. (B) He takes many part-time jobs every day to earn living expenses and tuition.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Graduating from university typically means that one has completed their education and is now ready to enter the workforce or pursue further education. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom needs to choose between working or going abroad rather than taking many part-time jobs every day to earn living expenses and tuition."}}
{"Q": "This region is a habitat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many hummingbirds come here every year. (B) The owner planted some geraniums.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Many hummingbirds come here every year.\nExplanation: A habitat is a natural environment where a particular species of organism lives. Hummingbirds are known to be attracted to certain habitats, such as areas with flowers and nectar. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of this region being a habitat would be the presence of many hummingbirds, rather than the owner planting geraniums."}}
{"Q": "They disrupted homeostasis in its body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researchers fed the mice some capsicums. (B) The biologists disrupted the metabolic balance maintained by several processes in the mice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Homeostasis refers to the maintenance of a stable internal environment in an organism. Disrupting homeostasis can occur due to various factors, but in this case, the most plausible cause is the disruption of metabolic balance maintained by several processes in the mice. This could be due to the biologists manipulating the mice's diet, environment, or genetic makeup, among other factors. Feeding the mice some capsicums (choice A) may cause some discomfort or changes in the mice's digestive system, but it is unlikely to disrupt homeostasis in the body."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes the smell of pure and fresh. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He enjoyed the smell of coconut. (B) He drinks a cup of tea every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He enjoyed the smell of coconut.\nExplanation: Since Tom likes the smell of pure and fresh, it is likely that he would enjoy the natural and refreshing scent of coconut. Drinking tea every day does not necessarily relate to his preference for a certain smell."}}
{"Q": "Mario's bronchioles are blocked by something peculiar. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His lobules lose function soon. (B) He usually suffers from arrhythmias.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His lobules lose function soon.\nExplanation: Bronchioles are small air passages in the lungs that lead to the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. If they become blocked, it can lead to a decrease in airflow and oxygen exchange, which can cause the lobules (small sections of the lungs) to lose function over time. This can lead to respiratory distress and potentially serious health complications. Arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, are not directly related to bronchiole blockage."}}
{"Q": "The real story became a big screen adaptation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many audience commented on its dramatic effects. (B) More people in us were attracted by it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. More people in the US were attracted by it.\nExplanation: When a real story is adapted into a movie, it often attracts more attention and interest from the public. This can lead to increased ticket sales and a larger audience. Therefore, it is more plausible that the adaptation resulted in more people being attracted to it rather than just commenting on its dramatic effects."}}
{"Q": "She picks two the small flaps at the base of the leaf. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary grabbed a bunch of some kind of plant with foliage and asked what' s it. (B) Lucy wants to observe stipules.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Stipules are small flaps at the base of a leaf, and Lucy wants to observe them. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy picked the small flaps at the base of the leaf to observe the stipules rather than Mary randomly grabbing a bunch of plants and asking what they are."}}
{"Q": "It's proved that sound can not transmitted in vacuum. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom did a lot of experiments. (B) A research team went to the Sahara desert to carry out scientific research.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions that sound cannot be transmitted in a vacuum, which is a well-established scientific fact. This has been proven through numerous experiments conducted by scientists over the years. Therefore, option A, which suggests that Tom did a lot of experiments, is a more plausible answer than option B, which talks about a research team going to the Sahara desert to carry out scientific research, but does not provide any specific information about the topic at hand."}}
{"Q": "Water was used as as a new source of electricity. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The night in the fall becomes longer. (B) This hydro-energetic power manifested its own drawbacks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: While water can be a renewable and clean source of energy, the construction of hydroelectric power plants can have negative impacts on the environment and local communities. Dams can disrupt natural river ecosystems and displace people living in the area. Additionally, the amount of electricity generated by hydroelectric power can be affected by changes in water levels due to drought or other factors. Therefore, it is likely that the use of water as a new source of electricity would have some drawbacks. Option A, on the other hand, is unrelated to the use of water as a source of electricity."}}
{"Q": "He had a reaction. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jerry was stimulated. (B) Billy heard that lily's rhizomes can be used as medicine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jerry was stimulated.\nExplanation: The given sentence only mentions that \"he had a reaction\" without specifying who \"he\" is or what the reaction was. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the cause of the reaction based on the given information alone. However, option A is a more plausible answer as it suggests that \"he\" was stimulated by something, which could have caused a physical or emotional reaction. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the given sentence and does not provide any logical explanation for the cause of the reaction."}}
{"Q": "He often observed arthropods like insects. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was interested in Exoskeletons. (B) He is a biological scientist who specializes in the study of insects.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that he often observed arthropods like insects suggests that he has a specific interest or expertise in this area. Option B states that he is a biological scientist who specializes in the study of insects, which is a more plausible explanation for his behavior than option A, which simply mentions an interest in exoskeletons without any clear connection to observing arthropods."}}
{"Q": "The wolf was hunting the antelope. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The antelope asked help from his companions. (B) The large antlers are their powerful weapon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The antelope asked help from his companions.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the antelope would try to seek help from its companions rather than relying on its antlers as a weapon against a predator like a wolf. Antelopes are known to be social animals and often travel in herds, so it is likely that the antelope would call for help from its fellow herd members to fend off the wolf."}}
{"Q": "Jerboas are hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They pick up food by their toes. (B) They have different access to food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They have different access to food.\nExplanation: Jerboas are small desert rodents that live in arid regions where food can be scarce. As a result, they have adapted to have different access to food sources. Some species, like the long-eared jerboa, have long hind legs that allow them to jump high and catch insects in mid-air. Others, like the pygmy jerboa, have shorter legs and rely on seeds and vegetation found closer to the ground. Therefore, it is more plausible that jerboas have different access to food rather than picking up food by their toes."}}
{"Q": "He often studies various phenomena in life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is a sociologist. (B) Tom wanted to consider biology as a subject.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom studies various phenomena in life suggests that he is interested in understanding human behavior and social interactions, which are key areas of study in sociology. On the other hand, the option of considering biology as a subject does not seem to be a likely cause for his interest in studying different phenomena in life."}}
{"Q": "Babes are enjoying sunshine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather is pleasant on the beachs. (B) The farmed managed to kill a lot chiggers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The weather is pleasant on the beachs.\nExplanation: It is common for people to enjoy sunshine on the beach when the weather is pleasant. Chiggers are not typically a factor in beach environments, so option B is not a plausible answer. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the babes enjoying the sunshine."}}
{"Q": "He fastened his seat belt. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He swung his arms. (B) He was saved from being thrown out of the car in the car accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He was saved from being thrown out of the car in the car accident.\nExplanation: Fastening a seat belt is a safety measure that helps to keep a person in their seat during a car accident. It prevents them from being thrown out of the car and potentially suffering serious injuries or death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the result of fastening his seat belt was that he was saved from being thrown out of the car in a car accident. Swinging his arms is not a direct result of fastening a seat belt."}}
{"Q": "Kittiwakes were hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are harmful. (B) They ate a lot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When animals are hungry, they tend to eat more to satisfy their hunger. Therefore, it is more plausible that the kittiwakes ate a lot rather than being harmful."}}
{"Q": "They found out that it was written by the famous poet Shelley. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They read a very beautiful poem. (B) The student has looked up the book.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The student has looked up the book.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the discovery of the authorship was made through some kind of research or investigation. Therefore, it is more likely that the student looked up the book and found out that it was written by Shelley, rather than simply reading a beautiful poem and assuming it was written by a famous poet."}}
{"Q": "His mother bought him a cygnet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Every day he catches aquatic insects to feed it. (B) He feeds it with plants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy would feed the cygnet with plants, as they are a common food source for swans and their young. Catching aquatic insects every day would be a difficult and time-consuming task, and may not provide enough nutrition for the cygnet to grow and thrive."}}
{"Q": "Tom goes out in a down jacket in summer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The carbon dioxide, one of the major greenhouse gases, content in the air decreases. (B) Tom is suffering from heat stroke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is highly unlikely for someone to wear a down jacket in summer as it is a thick and warm material designed for cold weather. Wearing it in hot weather can lead to heat stroke, which is a serious medical condition caused by overheating. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer. Option A is not related to the situation and is not a logical consequence of wearing a down jacket in summer."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to a moor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People around him heard noise. (B) There he saw many species.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom saw many species in the moor as it is a natural habitat for various plants and animals. There is no indication that Tom made any noise that would attract attention from people around him."}}
{"Q": "He is diagnosed with pancreatitis in the hospital. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim's pancreas are inflamed. (B) Tom has been infected with pancreatic necrosis virus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tim's pancreas are inflamed.\nExplanation: Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as alcohol consumption, gallstones, high levels of triglycerides in the blood, and certain medications. Pancreatic necrosis virus is not a known cause of pancreatitis, making option B less plausible. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of Tim's pancreatitis."}}
{"Q": "Mary watched many bison in the park. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary found the small bison is similar to the older bison. (B) They were bisons too.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the fact that Mary watched many bison in the park. It is logical to assume that the bison she watched were also bison, so option B is the most likely outcome. Option A does not make sense in the context of the sentence and is not related to the fact that Mary watched many bison."}}
{"Q": "Tom has long-standing dyspepsia. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This disease caused degenerative changes of the myocardium in Tom's heart. (B) Tom had suffers from some kind of stomach condition.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Dyspepsia is a medical term used to describe a group of symptoms that occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract, including stomach pain or discomfort, bloating, nausea, and heartburn. It is commonly caused by stomach conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, or gastritis. Option A is not a plausible answer as it refers to a heart condition, which is not related to dyspepsia."}}
{"Q": "Nobody believed Tom's code was copied by Jack. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom compared the two set of codes as evidence in public. (B) Tom cleared  the two set of codes as evidence in public.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Tom comparing the two sets of codes in public would be a more plausible answer as it would provide concrete evidence to support his claim that Jack copied his code. Clearing the two sets of codes as evidence in public would not necessarily prove Tom's innocence and may not be a feasible solution."}}
{"Q": "He found that the mouthparts of this little ant were slowly getting bigger with age. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom raised an ant cub at home. (B) Mario feels thirsty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom raised an ant cub at home.\nExplanation: It is unlikely that Mario feeling thirsty would cause the mouthparts of an ant to slowly get bigger with age. However, it is possible that Tom raising an ant cub at home could lead to this observation, as he would have been able to closely monitor the ant's growth and development over time. Additionally, changes in diet or environmental factors could also contribute to the growth of the ant's mouthparts."}}
{"Q": "I fed the hummingbird in my cage twice a day. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I try to keep it from coldness. (B) It could not maintain its high metabolism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Hummingbirds have a very high metabolism and require a constant supply of nectar to maintain their energy levels. Feeding a hummingbird in a cage twice a day may not be enough to meet its energy needs, leading to a decrease in its ability to maintain its high metabolism. This can result in health problems and a shorter lifespan for the bird. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is not relevant to the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "The road was made of concrete. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The road should be of high strength. (B) The road should be of high freezing resistance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The road should be of high strength.\nExplanation: Concrete is a strong and durable material that can withstand heavy traffic and weather conditions. Therefore, it is commonly used for constructing roads that need to support heavy loads and frequent use. While concrete does have some resistance to freezing, this is not the primary reason for its use in road construction. The main reason is its strength and durability."}}
{"Q": "Tom has lost his way. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He betrayed his partners for his own benefit. (B) Tom took out the map and began to determine his location.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom took out the map and began to determine his location.\nExplanation: Since Tom has lost his way, it is more plausible that he would try to find his way back by using a map rather than betraying his partners for his own benefit. Taking out the map and determining his location would be the logical and responsible thing to do in this situation."}}
{"Q": "Tom's mother has allergies-hay fever. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom also has allergies- hay fever. (B) His feelings of well being during the day diminished a lot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom also has allergies- hay fever.\nExplanation: Allergies are often hereditary, meaning they can be passed down from parents to their children. Therefore, it is plausible that Tom also has allergies- hay fever since his mother has it. Option B is less likely as it is not directly related to Tom's mother's allergies."}}
{"Q": "He jointed too many activities. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He betrayed his partners for his own benefit. (B) He felt tired.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He felt tired.\nExplanation: When someone joins too many activities, they may become overwhelmed and exhausted from trying to keep up with all of them. It is unlikely that they would betray their partners for their own benefit simply because they joined too many activities. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His blood vessel are obstructed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a tumor in the patient's blood vessel. (B) There is a hole in the patient's blood vessel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There is a tumor in the patient's blood vessel.\nExplanation: Tumors can grow inside blood vessels and obstruct blood flow. A hole in a blood vessel would cause bleeding, not obstruction. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack's mother never lets him take part in any kind of activities. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He never gets in a dangerous situation as other kids do. (B) He has no free time to entertain.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He has no free time to entertain.\nExplanation: Since Jack's mother never lets him take part in any kind of activities, he is likely to have no free time to entertain himself. This can lead to boredom and frustration, which can have negative effects on his mental health and overall well-being. Additionally, he may miss out on opportunities to develop social skills and make friends, which can impact his future relationships and success in life. While it is true that he may avoid dangerous situations, this is not a guaranteed outcome and should not be the sole reason for limiting a child's activities."}}
{"Q": "Amy doesn't want to have contact with petrochemicals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chemicals derived from petroleum can be dangerous. (B) The factory discharges industrial waste into the water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Chemicals derived from petroleum can be dangerous.\nExplanation: Petrochemicals are chemicals derived from petroleum, which is a non-renewable resource. Many petrochemicals are known to be harmful to human health and the environment. Exposure to these chemicals can cause a range of health problems, including respiratory issues, skin irritation, and even cancer. Therefore, it is understandable that Amy would want to avoid contact with petrochemicals. On the other hand, choice B is not directly related to petrochemicals and does not explain why Amy wants to avoid them."}}
{"Q": "A has higher pressure than B. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A weights heavier than B. (B) B weights heavier than A.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A weights heavier than B.\nExplanation: The weight of an object does not directly affect its pressure. Pressure is determined by the force exerted on a given area. Therefore, the weight of A or B is not relevant to their respective pressures. It is more likely that A has a higher pressure due to factors such as a greater force being applied to a smaller area or a higher temperature causing an increase in gas pressure."}}
{"Q": "Jack doesn't like vegetables with slender stalks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He never eats celery. (B) He hasn't pay many attentions on the disease.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He never eats celery.\nExplanation: Since Jack doesn't like vegetables with slender stalks, he would avoid eating celery which has a slender stalk. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B doesn't make sense in this context as there is no connection between not liking slender stalks and paying attention to diseases."}}
{"Q": "Drought stress weakens plant water potential and photosynthesis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plants were beginning to wilt. (B) The plant harvest was affected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: When plants experience drought stress, they are not able to take up enough water to maintain their turgor pressure, which causes them to wilt. This is a common symptom of drought stress in plants. While a decrease in photosynthesis can also affect plant growth and yield, wilting is a more immediate and visible effect of drought stress. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She is a technician. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her knowledge is very profound. (B) She has to absorb water every once in a while.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her knowledge is very profound.\nExplanation: Being a technician requires a certain level of knowledge and expertise in a specific field. Therefore, it is more plausible that as a result of being a technician, her knowledge is very profound. Option B, which suggests that she has to absorb water every once in a while, is not related to being a technician and seems unlikely."}}
{"Q": "She bought a book and began reading. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice enjoys her free time. (B) Lucy has waited for Tom for a long time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Alice enjoys her free time.\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"she\" bought a book and began reading, but it does not specify who \"she\" is. However, the fact that she bought a book and began reading suggests that she enjoys reading in her free time. Choice A is a more plausible answer because it is a common reason for someone to buy a book and start reading. Choice B is unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Tom drank a lot and passed out. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor diagnosed him with alcohol poisoning. (B) He fainted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence only mentions that Tom passed out, which is more likely to be a result of fainting rather than alcohol poisoning. While excessive drinking can lead to alcohol poisoning, the sentence does not provide enough information to support that conclusion."}}
{"Q": "Farmers know how to pollinate flowers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom needed to pollinate his plants. (B) The farm grows many flowers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that farmers know how to pollinate flowers suggests that there was a need for them to do so, which is provided by option A. Option B is not a plausible answer as growing many flowers does not necessarily require knowledge of pollination techniques."}}
{"Q": "They added air into the water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They did an experiment about aeration. (B) The little boy suffers from roseola.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They did an experiment about aeration.\nExplanation: The sentence states that air was added into the water, which suggests a deliberate action. The most plausible reason for adding air into water is to increase its oxygen content, which is often done in experiments about aeration. Option B, which suggests a sick child, is not related to the sentence and is therefore an unlikely explanation."}}
{"Q": "The shop sells combs. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People buy them for their need. (B) People buy them for their ears.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. People buy them for their need.\nExplanation: It is more likely that people buy combs for their intended purpose of grooming their hair, rather than for their ears which is not a common use for combs. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John was  thirsty but had no water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found a vase as a substitute. (B) He ate some vegetables.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He ate some vegetables.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John would try to quench his thirst by consuming something edible, such as vegetables, rather than using a vase as a substitute for water. Eating vegetables can also provide some hydration and nutrients to help alleviate his thirst."}}
{"Q": "Many domestic cats lack the ability of adaptation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They can't live well in a strange environment. (B) They are ill-adapted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Domestic cats that lack the ability of adaptation may struggle to adjust to new environments, making it difficult for them to live well outside of their familiar surroundings. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and other health issues, as well as a decreased quality of life. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They found that the breasts grow during this time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The female elephant in the zoo is getting old. (B) The scientist focused on caring for the breasts for the first few weeks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The breasts grow during this time because the female elephant is pregnant. \nExplanation: Pregnancy causes hormonal changes in the body, which can lead to breast growth in preparation for lactation and nursing the newborn calf. Option (A) is not relevant to the situation and option (B) does not explain the biological process of breast growth during pregnancy."}}
{"Q": "His mother bought the fermented dough from the supermarket. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The starch was placed in fridge for a long time. (B) Tom wants to eat pizza tonight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the dough was fermented, which means it was left to rise for a period of time. This process requires yeast or other leavening agents, which would not be present in starch that was simply left in the fridge for a long time. Therefore, it is more likely that the mother bought the dough from the supermarket, where it would have been pre-made and fermented. The fact that Tom wants to eat pizza tonight is not mentioned as a cause for the mother buying the dough."}}
{"Q": "The ape in the zoo was single last year. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This year it's got a baby ape on its back. (B) The zoo employed a lot of keepers to complete the task.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is biologically plausible for the ape to have a baby this year if it was single last year. The zoo employing a lot of keepers to complete the task is not a logical or relevant outcome of the ape's relationship status."}}
{"Q": "When charged, the tungsten wires will excite the air atoms and emit light. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bulbs contain tungsten wires and air. (B) Mike placed a small magnetic needle next to the energized coil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: When an electric current passes through the tungsten wires in a bulb, the wires become hot and excite the air atoms around them, causing them to emit light. This is the basic principle behind incandescent light bulbs. Choice B, about a magnetic needle, is not relevant to the question and does not explain the cause of the light emission."}}
{"Q": "David committed the sin of schism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) David was sentenced to hang. (B) He became violent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer. \nExplanation: The sin of schism refers to the act of causing a division or separation within a religious group or organization. In the context of the Bible, King David did not commit the sin of schism. He did commit other sins, such as adultery and murder, but there is no record of him causing a division within the Israelite community. Therefore, neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is hesitant about what major he will study in college. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decides to choose anthropology as his major in college. (B) He finally decided to be a student majoring in microbial physiology.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Tom is hesitant about what major he will study in college, it is more plausible that he would choose a more general major like anthropology, which would allow him to explore different areas of study before deciding on a more specific field. It is less likely that he would immediately choose a highly specialized major like microbial physiology without being certain about his interests and abilities in that field."}}
{"Q": "They found that those animals lived in their habit from ancient and never moved away. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sheep easily run away. (B) They studied the life habits of many wild animals in South Africa.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the animals never moved away from their habitat, implying that they were not easily scared or threatened. Therefore, option A, which suggests that sheep easily run away, is a more plausible answer than option B, which is not directly related to the given information."}}
{"Q": "He bought lots of truffles. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wanted some subterranean fungi. (B) Black's mother said that Black should have a good habit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He wanted some subterranean fungi.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the action of buying truffles. The statement mentions that he bought lots of truffles, which implies that he had a specific desire or need for them. Option B, on the other hand, seems unrelated to the action of buying truffles and lacks context."}}
{"Q": "He found that they had body temperature. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had a bath. (B) He measured the birds with a thermometer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He measured the birds with a thermometer.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the person measured the birds' body temperature with a thermometer, which is a common method used to determine the body temperature of animals. Taking a bath would not cause the birds to have body temperature, as they are warm-blooded animals and maintain their own body temperature."}}
{"Q": "It layed eggs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The kudzu was exposed to the oxygen. (B) The rattlesnake was pregnant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The rattlesnake was pregnant.\nExplanation: Snakes, like many other animals, lay eggs as a part of their reproductive process. Therefore, it is more plausible that the snake laid eggs because it was pregnant rather than the kudzu being exposed to oxygen causing it to lay eggs."}}
{"Q": "He redesigned the product for better utility. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The product designer aimed to enhance customers' satisfaction. (B) The chief bought oats.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The product designer aimed to enhance customers' satisfaction.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the product was redesigned for better utility, which implies that the previous design was not meeting the customers' needs or expectations. Therefore, it is more plausible that the product designer aimed to enhance customers' satisfaction by improving the product's functionality and usability. Option B, which talks about the chief buying oats, is irrelevant and has no connection with the given sentence."}}
{"Q": "When I saw them again today, I noticed that exfoliation occured. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their group was in charge of the gelatin Infiltration. (B) I found that many deeply-buried rocks were exposed at the earth's surface by erosion long time ago.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Exfoliation is a geological process where layers of rock peel away from the surface due to weathering and erosion. Choice B mentions erosion exposing deeply-buried rocks, which is a plausible cause for exfoliation. Choice A, on the other hand, mentions gelatin infiltration which is not related to geological processes and therefore not a likely cause for exfoliation."}}
{"Q": "Amy has a unsually light weight compared with others. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy was born with deficiencies in legs. (B) A weights heavier than B.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that Amy has a lighter weight compared to others suggests that there may be a physical condition or deficiency that affects her ability to gain weight. Option A, which suggests that Amy was born with deficiencies in her legs, is a more plausible answer as it could affect her overall physical development and metabolism. Option B, which suggests that a weight is heavier than another, does not provide a logical explanation for Amy's unusually light weight."}}
{"Q": "Mike was exposed to the Rhinoviruses. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He suffered from bronchitis. (B) His lung functions were seriously affected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a plausible answer.\nExplanation: Rhinoviruses are a common cause of the common cold, which typically affects the upper respiratory tract (nose, throat, sinuses). While bronchitis is a respiratory condition that affects the lower respiratory tract (bronchial tubes), it is not typically caused by rhinoviruses. Similarly, while severe cases of the common cold can lead to complications such as pneumonia, it is unlikely that exposure to rhinoviruses alone would seriously affect lung functions. Therefore, a more plausible answer would be that Mike developed symptoms of the common cold, such as a runny nose, sore throat, and cough."}}
{"Q": "Tom threw a ball at his teacher. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The ball hit his teacher. (B) Possiblly he had a crash on her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The ball hit his teacher.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the ball hit the teacher as a result of Tom throwing it, rather than him having a crush on her. It is also not appropriate or relevant to the situation to suggest a romantic interest."}}
{"Q": "She used PS to improve the intensification. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The product designer aimed to enhance customers' satisfaction. (B) Lucy has taken a vague photo.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The use of PS to improve intensification suggests that the original photo was not clear or vivid enough. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy took a vague photo and used PS to enhance its quality rather than the product designer aiming to enhance customers' satisfaction."}}
{"Q": "The butcher killed the goat with a dull blade in public. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The goat had a big gash in its throat that bled for quite a bit. (B) The goat's head was chopped off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The goat had a big gash in its throat that bled for quite a bit.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a dull blade would cause a big gash in the goat's throat rather than cleanly chopping off its head. Additionally, the fact that the killing was done in public suggests that there may have been some sort of reaction or commotion from onlookers, which would be more likely if the goat was bleeding heavily."}}
{"Q": "Amy sees bronchi on either side of the trachea. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy has tracheitis. (B) Amy observes the patient's tracheae.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Amy is observing the patient's tracheae, it is likely that she is looking at a diagram or image of the respiratory system. In this case, it is normal to see bronchi branching off from the trachea on either side. Tracheitis, on the other hand, is an inflammation of the trachea and would not necessarily cause the appearance of bronchi."}}
{"Q": "She felt the texture of the flowers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She stroked the petals with her fingers. (B) Butterflies pollinate flowers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence states that she felt the texture of the flowers, which implies that she physically touched them. The most plausible way to do this is by stroking the petals with her fingers. Choice B, which talks about butterflies pollinating flowers, is not related to the action of feeling the texture of the flowers."}}
{"Q": "Monkeys know how to induce insects with sticks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They can feed themselves on insects. (B) They can always accurately locate the insects.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Monkeys being able to induce insects with sticks means that they have developed a skill to obtain food for themselves. This implies that they can feed themselves on insects, making option A the more plausible answer. Option B is not necessarily true as accurately locating insects may depend on other factors such as the availability of insects in the area."}}
{"Q": "The water cycle went to a halt here. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wires were cut out in this building. (B) There is no rainfall at all here.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The water cycle involves the continuous movement of water from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere and back again through processes such as evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. If there is no rainfall at all in a certain area, it means that there is no source of water to replenish the cycle, causing it to come to a halt. On the other hand, wires being cut out in a building would not directly affect the water cycle."}}
{"Q": "Lila was infected with amebiasis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was uncomfortable. (B) Her skin can better stay intact.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She was uncomfortable.\nExplanation: Amebiasis is an infection caused by the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. It primarily affects the intestines and can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and cramping. In severe cases, it can also lead to liver abscesses. Therefore, it is likely that Lila experienced discomfort as a result of the infection. Option B, on the other hand, is not related to amebiasis as it refers to the skin staying intact, which is not affected by this particular infection."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's physical condition cannot support her to give birth to a child. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy's physical condition cannot support her to give birth to a child. (B) Lucy has a strong ability of adaptation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement clearly states that Lucy's physical condition is the cause of her inability to give birth to a child. Option B is not relevant to the given information and does not provide a plausible explanation for Lucy's condition."}}
{"Q": "It swallowed the whole mouse. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The psyllid was hungry. (B) The copperhead snake caught a mouse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the copperhead snake caught a mouse and swallowed it whole. Psyllids are tiny insects and are not known to eat mice, making option A unlikely. Copperhead snakes are known to eat small rodents like mice, and their ability to swallow prey whole is well-documented."}}
{"Q": "Not soon later the rocks in the pond were super clean and bald. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom scattered some big pieces of food into the tadpoles pond. (B) Some limpets were put into a pond where algae prospered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Limpets are known to feed on algae, so if they were put into a pond where algae was abundant, they would likely consume it and leave the rocks clean and bald. On the other hand, scattering big pieces of food into a tadpole pond would not necessarily lead to the rocks becoming clean and bald."}}
{"Q": "A lot of the ice melted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The climate around the iceberg changed. (B) The large amount of glaciers collpased and were burried underground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The climate around the iceberg changed.\nExplanation: The melting of ice is often caused by a change in temperature or climate. If the climate around the iceberg becomes warmer, the ice will start to melt. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which suggests that a large amount of glaciers collapsed and were buried underground, as this is not a common occurrence and would require specific geological conditions."}}
{"Q": "The  researcher wants to know the essence of grain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He analyzed the components of it. (B) He cannot find the components of it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The researcher analyzed the components of grain in order to understand its essence. This would involve breaking down the grain into its constituent parts and examining them to determine what makes grain unique and essential. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He always burns firewood to keep warm. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chris is cold in winter. (B) Tom lives in a forest where the weather is warm and moist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Chris is cold in winter.\nExplanation: The fact that Chris burns firewood to keep warm suggests that he is experiencing cold temperatures. Option B, which suggests that Tom lives in a warm and moist forest, does not explain why he would need to burn firewood for warmth. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There's a lot of crime in ABC. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Detectives are unemployed. (B) ABC is a country with a very backward social development.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The option B, \"ABC is a country with a very backward social development,\" is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the root cause of the crime in ABC is the lack of social development. This could mean that there is a lack of education, employment opportunities, and social services, which can lead to poverty, desperation, and crime. On the other hand, option A, \"Detectives are unemployed,\" is not a likely cause of crime as the lack of detectives would only affect the ability to solve crimes, not necessarily the occurrence of crime itself."}}
{"Q": "Many of them use rivers as their habitat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many animals are searching for suitable habitats. (B) Varnishes utilize refraction of light.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Many animals are searching for suitable habitats.\nExplanation: Rivers provide a suitable habitat for many animals due to the availability of water, food, and shelter. Many animals have adapted to living in or near rivers to meet their basic needs. For example, fish live in rivers because they need water to breathe and reproduce, while birds and mammals use rivers as a source of food and water. Therefore, it is more plausible that animals use rivers as their habitat because they are searching for suitable habitats rather than varnishes utilizing refraction of light."}}
{"Q": "Jack was tested positive for stimulant. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack ate a bar of chocolate before the game. (B) She can not stand the old drug's effect.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Stimulants are substances that increase alertness, attention, and energy. Chocolate contains caffeine, which is a mild stimulant. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jack ate a bar of chocolate before the game and tested positive for stimulant rather than not being able to stand the old drug's effect."}}
{"Q": "Ceftriaxone can resist many kinds of bacteria. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He can be protected from coldness. (B) Doctors often prescribe this medicine to patients.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can resist many types of bacteria, making it a popular choice for doctors to prescribe to patients with bacterial infections. It is not related to protecting someone from coldness."}}
{"Q": "Critters time their reproductive cycle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is used to the seasonal variability. (B) The chances of their babies' survival can be maximized.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Critters timing their reproductive cycle allows them to maximize the chances of their babies' survival. By reproducing during times when resources are abundant and weather conditions are favorable, offspring have a better chance of surviving and thriving. This increases the overall success of the species and ensures their continued survival. While critters may become accustomed to seasonal variability (choice A), the primary reason for timing their reproductive cycle is to increase the chances of offspring survival."}}
{"Q": "Gunshots always happen in America. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Statistics reveal that many children die from firearm every year. (B) All citizens have the right to take a gun with them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Statistics reveal that many children die from firearm every year. This is a more plausible answer as it is a fact that gun violence is a major issue in America, with a high number of deaths and injuries caused by firearms. The easy availability of guns and lack of strict gun control laws contribute to this problem. While citizens do have the right to bear arms, it is important to ensure that this right is balanced with measures to prevent gun violence and protect public safety."}}
{"Q": "Bob is a diner. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is eating bread. (B) He opens the door.", "R": {"text": "Answer: It is impossible to determine what happened as a result based solely on the fact that Bob is a diner. \nExplanation: Being a diner does not provide any context or information about what actions or events may have occurred. Therefore, neither option (A) nor (B) can be considered a plausible answer without additional information."}}
{"Q": "Leads can be touched by hands. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Budgerigars live on cliffs. (B) Wires covered by soft flexible plastic are touchable.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The cause of leads being touchable by hands is due to the fact that they are covered by soft flexible plastic, which makes them safe to touch. Option (A) about budgerigars living on cliffs is irrelevant and does not explain why leads can be touched by hands. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Earthquake close to sea leads to tsunami. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Massive waves of the sea brings in tsunami. (B) Massive waves of the sea brings in earthquake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Massive waves of the sea brings in tsunami.\nExplanation: When an earthquake occurs under the sea, it can cause the water above it to move and create massive waves. These waves can travel across the ocean and reach the shore, causing a tsunami. Therefore, the cause of a tsunami is the earthquake, not the waves of the sea bringing in an earthquake."}}
{"Q": "Tom had a heart attack suddenly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He died of it. (B) The utility has saved his life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the utility (presumably referring to emergency medical services) was able to save Tom's life by providing prompt medical attention and treatment for his heart attack. While it is possible that Tom died as a result of the heart attack, the fact that the utility is mentioned suggests that they played a role in his outcome."}}
{"Q": "The wind here is very strong. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The wind took away a lot of silt particles. (B) Farmland and houses will be destroyed by wind and heavy rainfall.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The sentence only mentions the strength of the wind, and does not provide any information about heavy rainfall or potential destruction of farmland and houses. However, it is plausible that the wind could take away silt particles due to its strength."}}
{"Q": "The policewomen set about investigating the case. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A neighbor reported to the police that Tom had a drug deal in his house. (B) There was a murder case in this area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the policewomen are investigating a case, and the cause of this investigation is given as a neighbor reporting a drug deal in Tom's house. This is a more plausible answer than option B, which mentions a murder case but does not provide any connection to the investigation being carried out by the policewomen."}}
{"Q": "This plane can't take off normally. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The wing on one side of the plane malfunctioned. (B) The ground is dry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the wing on one side of the plane malfunctioned, it would cause an imbalance in the lift and prevent the plane from taking off normally. On the other hand, the dryness of the ground would not affect the plane's ability to take off."}}
{"Q": "Lucy can dive to the bottom of the sea. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy is carrying an oxygen tank. (B) Lucy has a strong ability of adaptation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lucy has a strong ability of adaptation, such as being able to hold her breath for a long time or having developed physiological adaptations that allow her to dive to the bottom of the sea without the need for an oxygen tank. While carrying an oxygen tank is a possibility, it is less likely as it would be cumbersome and limit her mobility underwater."}}
{"Q": "Evaporation is obvious in hot Hainan Island. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Coral reefs are formed here. (B) Hainan Island has abundant precipitation all year round.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Evaporation in hot Hainan Island leads to increased humidity in the air, which can result in precipitation. However, coral reefs are not formed as a direct result of evaporation. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Collecting of plants from the wild were not under control. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Snowdrops are threatened. (B) The ecological balance was damaged.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When collecting of plants from the wild is not under control, it can lead to over-harvesting and depletion of certain plant species. This can disrupt the ecological balance as these plants play important roles in the food chain and provide habitats for other organisms. Additionally, the loss of plant species can also have negative impacts on the environment, such as soil erosion and decreased air quality. While snowdrops may be threatened by uncontrolled collecting, the larger issue at hand is the potential damage to the overall ecosystem."}}
{"Q": "The food here was poisoned by mycotoxins. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) You should not touch its surface. (B) The food was not eatable.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The food was not eatable.\nExplanation: Mycotoxins are toxic substances produced by certain types of fungi that can contaminate food. Consuming food contaminated with mycotoxins can cause a range of health problems, including nausea, vomiting, and even death in severe cases. Therefore, if the food was poisoned by mycotoxins, it would not be safe to eat and should be discarded. Option (A) is not relevant to the situation described in the question."}}
{"Q": "Poor John hoped to start his own business. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mother explained to him patiently using the picture book at home. (B) He turned to reliable proposals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer as it suggests that Poor John sought out reliable proposals to help him start his own business. Option A, on the other hand, does not seem relevant to the question and does not provide any explanation as to what happened to Poor John's business aspirations."}}
{"Q": "Researchers found that the metabolism of mice accelerated. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The researchers fed the mice some capsicums. (B) The researchers injected glucose into mice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The researchers fed the mice some capsicums.\nExplanation: Capsicums contain capsaicin, which has been shown to increase metabolism in both humans and animals. Injecting glucose into mice would not necessarily accelerate their metabolism."}}
{"Q": "Permanently frozen ground were utilized to protect them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The agriculturist placed the peanuts under sitimulate drought conditions. (B) Only Permafrost can preserve these special seeds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Permafrost is a layer of permanently frozen ground that can preserve organic matter, including seeds, for thousands of years. This is because the freezing temperatures prevent decay and other biological processes that would normally break down the seeds over time. Therefore, it is more plausible that the peanuts were stored in permafrost to protect them rather than being placed under simulated drought conditions by an agriculturist."}}
{"Q": "Her autopsy showed that she died of suffocation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jane shows symptoms of hypothyroidism. (B) Emma was locked in her throat by a robber.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Emma was locked in her throat by a robber.\nExplanation: The autopsy report clearly states that the cause of death was suffocation, which suggests that something obstructed Emma's airway. Option A, which suggests hypothyroidism, is not a plausible answer as it is a condition that affects the thyroid gland and does not directly cause suffocation. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Emma was robbed and something was locked in her throat, which could have caused her to suffocate. This is a more plausible explanation for the cause of her death."}}
{"Q": "I think it is like a lizard. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a anols in the room. (B) My girlfriend describe the caterpillar she just saw.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The description of a caterpillar being similar to a lizard is more likely to be a result of someone describing it, rather than the presence of an unrelated animal in the room."}}
{"Q": "This shop sells both high-quality and low-quality wines. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Visitors find it easy to distinguish them. (B) The price of high-quality wine is much more expensive.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: It is common for shops that sell both high-quality and low-quality wines to price the high-quality wines much more expensive than the low-quality ones. This is because high-quality wines require more resources and expertise to produce, making them more valuable. Visitors may still be able to distinguish between the two types of wines, but the price difference is a more likely result of selling both types of wines in the same shop."}}
{"Q": "The boy bite the lemon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Saliva flew out from his mouth. (B) He spited out several seeds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Saliva flew out from his mouth.\nExplanation: When someone bites into a lemon, the sour taste can cause their salivary glands to produce more saliva than usual. This excess saliva can cause it to fly out from their mouth. Spitting out seeds is not a common reaction to biting into a lemon."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to choose a letter to represent the partial pressure of carbon dioxide. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He loves the beautiful structureb of it. (B) He uses capitalized P.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tom most likely chose to use capitalized P to represent the partial pressure of carbon dioxide because it is a common convention in chemistry to use capital letters to represent variables. Additionally, using a capital letter distinguishes it from lowercase p, which is often used to represent pressure in general."}}
{"Q": "The scientist has collected some minerals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He takes in substances of nutrition from them. (B) He has found magnesium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He has found magnesium.\nExplanation: The fact that the scientist has collected minerals does not necessarily mean that he has taken in substances of nutrition from them. However, it is plausible that he has found magnesium among the minerals he collected, as magnesium is a common mineral found in the Earth's crust."}}
{"Q": "He is a nuturalist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He thinks about both direct and indirect benefits of harvests. (B) He goes all over the world to collect specimens.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: A naturalist is someone who studies and observes nature, including plants and animals. It is more likely that a naturalist would travel around the world to collect specimens for study and observation rather than thinking about the direct and indirect benefits of harvests. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sean's immune system was damaged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy was wearing a skirt. (B) The adenoviruses in Sean reacts strongly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The adenoviruses in Sean reacts strongly.\nExplanation: Adenoviruses are known to cause respiratory infections and can weaken the immune system. If Sean's immune system was damaged, it is likely that the adenoviruses he was exposed to caused a strong reaction in his body, leading to the damage. Lucy wearing a skirt is not a plausible cause for Sean's immune system damage."}}
{"Q": "Furan is a good choice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We need a substitute of dioxin. (B) Tom searched the typical names of fullerenes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that Furan was chosen as a substitute for dioxin, indicating that dioxin was not a desirable option. The reason for this is not given, but dioxin is a highly toxic chemical that can cause serious health problems, including cancer and reproductive and developmental issues. Therefore, finding a safer alternative like Furan would be a good choice. Option B is not relevant to the statement and does not provide a plausible explanation for why Furan was chosen."}}
{"Q": "He is proficient in the use of gerund. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Animals eat grain and die. (B) He knows the compound structure of gerund.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If someone is proficient in the use of gerund, it means they have a good understanding of how to use gerunds in sentences. Therefore, the most plausible result would be that they know the compound structure of gerund, as stated in option B. Option A is completely unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "America is a country of tolerance. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Li Ming has the same habits with people from Taiwan. (B) It accepted diverse cultures.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: As a result of America being a country of tolerance, it has accepted diverse cultures. Tolerance means accepting and respecting differences, and this has allowed people from different backgrounds to come together and share their cultures. This has led to a rich and diverse society in America, where people can learn from each other and celebrate their differences. Li Ming having the same habits as people from Taiwan is not necessarily a direct result of America's tolerance, as it could be due to personal preference or upbringing."}}
{"Q": "Data show that the earth's orbit has changed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ice ages followed. (B) Nothing happened after that.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The earth's orbit has changed over time due to various factors such as gravitational pull from other planets, changes in the earth's axis tilt, and variations in the sun's energy output. These changes have had significant impacts on the earth's climate, including the onset of ice ages. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There are some voles in the field. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The farmer has used some pesticide to drive away them to avoid damaging the field. (B) They utilize different strategies to win.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The presence of voles in the field can cause damage to crops, so it is likely that the farmer would take action to protect their harvest. Using pesticide is a common method to drive away pests and protect crops. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is less likely as it implies a competition between the voles, which is not directly related to the impact on the field."}}
{"Q": "These jockeys were very hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They prepared something to protect their knees. (B) They enjoyed the delicious food very much.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They enjoyed the delicious food very much.\nExplanation: Since the jockeys were very hungry, it is more plausible that they would eat and enjoy the food rather than prepare something to protect their knees."}}
{"Q": "She could start her travel at once. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is a student majoring in botany. (B) Jessi stepped on the craft.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of her being able to start her travel at once is not related to Tom's major in botany. However, Jessi stepping on the craft suggests that the means of transportation is ready and available for her to use, allowing her to start her travel immediately."}}
{"Q": "The girl keeps reading. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her brain keeps thinking. (B) The girl generate a sense of love on cichlids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her brain keeps thinking.\nExplanation: When someone reads, their brain is constantly processing information and making connections. This means that the girl's brain would continue to think and process information as she reads, leading to increased cognitive activity. Option B, on the other hand, is not necessarily a logical result of reading and lacks a clear explanation."}}
{"Q": "The nutritionist arranges her diet every day. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jenny's Schnauzer is 15 years old. (B) The actress hires a professional nutritionist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the actress hires a professional nutritionist to arrange her diet every day. This is a common practice among celebrities and athletes who want to maintain a healthy and balanced diet to support their physical and mental performance. The age of Jenny's Schnauzer is irrelevant to the question and does not provide any logical connection to the nutritionist arranging her diet."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to deprive himself from the disease of compulsive overeating. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has to stick to abstinence. (B) He is super healthy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He has to stick to abstinence.\nExplanation: Compulsive overeating is a disorder where a person feels an uncontrollable urge to eat, even when not hungry. To avoid this, Tom would have to stick to abstinence, which means completely avoiding certain trigger foods or situations that may lead to overeating. This can help him regain control over his eating habits and prevent the negative consequences of compulsive overeating, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. However, it does not necessarily mean that he will become super healthy, as there are many other factors that contribute to overall health."}}
{"Q": "Moa and ostrich looks very similar but are different. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Moas has furry feathers around their necks. (B) They cut their roots for food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Moas has furry feathers around their necks.\nExplanation: Moas and ostriches may look similar, but they are actually quite different. Moas were flightless birds that lived in New Zealand, while ostriches are found in Africa. One of the key differences between the two is that moas had furry feathers around their necks, while ostriches do not. This adaptation likely helped moas stay warm in the colder climate of New Zealand. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There are too much dirty plasma in his body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The clearance in Tom's body is too low. (B) John has severe inflammation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions \"dirty plasma\" which refers to a buildup of waste products in the blood. This is typically caused by a decrease in clearance, meaning the body is not effectively removing these waste products. Inflammation may contribute to this issue, but it is not the primary cause mentioned in the statement. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woodwind member in our orchestra invited him to join us. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The oboe player craved for a job. (B) The meeting ends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The woodwind member invited him to join us because he was interested in joining the orchestra. \nExplanation: There is no indication in the sentence that the oboe player was looking for a job, so option (A) can be ruled out. The sentence suggests that the woodwind member extended an invitation to the person, indicating that they were interested in having them join the orchestra. Therefore, option (B) can also be ruled out."}}
{"Q": "Luke is a biochemist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He specializes in the specific area of biochemistry he is interested. (B) Some of his cells die faster than non-vegetarians'.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Luke being a biochemist would mean that he has knowledge and expertise in the field of biochemistry. This would likely lead him to specialize in a specific area of biochemistry that he is interested in, such as protein synthesis or metabolic pathways. Option B, on the other hand, is not a logical or plausible result of being a biochemist and lacks any scientific basis."}}
{"Q": "They are all born of queen bees. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A large number of small bees live in hives. (B) There are three birds who have stayed on the tree for many years.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Queen bees are the only bees in a hive that are capable of laying fertilized eggs, which develop into female worker bees or unfertilized eggs, which develop into male drones. Therefore, all bees in a hive are born from a queen bee. The presence of a large number of small bees in a hive does not affect the fact that queen bees are the only ones capable of laying eggs. Option B, about birds staying on a tree, is completely unrelated to the reproduction of bees. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom tied the leash to the bark. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He needed to open the buckle before using it. (B) The bark is damaged.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tying a leash to a bark would likely cause damage to the bark, as it is not designed to withstand the pressure and friction of a leash being pulled against it. Option A is not relevant to the situation described."}}
{"Q": "He took in excreted Pseudoephedrine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My son opened the booklets. (B) The baby drank the breast milk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant commonly found in cold and allergy medications. It is known to pass into breast milk, so if someone who is breastfeeding takes medication containing pseudoephedrine, it is possible for the baby to ingest it through the breast milk. On the other hand, it is unlikely for a child to open a medication booklet and ingest the medication without adult supervision. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation."}}
{"Q": "One person is living in the atmosphere and another person is living out of the atmosphere. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has been coughing and spitting. (B) The person who lives in the atmosphere was alive and the person which lives out of the atmosphere died.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The person who lives in the atmosphere, which is Earth, is alive because it is the natural environment for humans. The person who lives out of the atmosphere, such as in space, would not be able to survive without proper equipment and support systems. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person living out of the atmosphere would die, rather than the person living in the atmosphere experiencing coughing and spitting."}}
{"Q": "Reactive matter can be chemically processed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Esters can be processed in chemical reactions. (B) It is an airtight container.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Esters can be processed in chemical reactions.\nExplanation: Reactive matter refers to substances that can undergo chemical reactions. Esters are a type of reactive matter that can be chemically processed through reactions such as hydrolysis, saponification, and transesterification. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the chemical processing of reactive matter. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide any relevant information about the chemical processing of reactive matter."}}
{"Q": "The necklace darkened. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy's silver necklace sat by the sink for a long time. (B) Tom put his amethysts necklace on the table and took a shower.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Silver jewelry can tarnish or darken when exposed to moisture and air for a long time. Therefore, it is more plausible that Amy's silver necklace darkened after sitting by the sink for a long time. Amethysts, on the other hand, are not known to darken or tarnish easily."}}
{"Q": "He only poured a little water on the cactus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He noticed the shoots it produced one day. (B) The cactus still grows well for a long time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The cactus still grows well for a long time.\nExplanation: Cacti are adapted to survive in arid environments with little water. They have the ability to store water in their stems and leaves, which allows them to survive for long periods without water. Therefore, pouring only a little water on the cactus would not have a significant impact on its growth or survival. As long as the cactus receives enough sunlight and nutrients, it should continue to grow well for a long time. Option (A) is less plausible because it suggests that the cactus produced shoots as a direct result of the small amount of water poured on it, which is unlikely."}}
{"Q": "Tom was stabbed by the gangster. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Fortunately, the knife only stabbed the ribs. (B) The central bank don't care about the rise or fall of the currency' value.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Fortunately, the knife only stabbed the ribs.\nExplanation: This answer is the most plausible because it directly relates to the situation presented in the question. It also provides a positive outcome by stating that the injury was not too severe. Option B is completely unrelated to the situation and does not provide any relevant information."}}
{"Q": "Jack drank a lot last night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He behaved badly towards the leader. (B) He also suffers from galactosemia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Since Jack drank a lot, it is more plausible that he behaved badly towards the leader due to the effects of alcohol on his behavior. Galactosemia is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to process galactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products, and is not related to alcohol consumption."}}
{"Q": "Tom's father is a fisherman. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is good at catching mice and other animals. (B) Tom's family was fed on seafood.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom's family was fed on seafood.\nExplanation: Since Tom's father is a fisherman, it is likely that he catches fish and other seafood for his family to eat. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's family was fed on seafood as a result of his father's profession. Option (A) is not a likely result of being a fisherman and catching seafood."}}
{"Q": "The virus mutated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Two hundred people died. (B) The virus had more chance to get into human body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: When a virus mutates, it means that its genetic material has changed, which can result in different characteristics such as increased infectivity or resistance to treatments. In this case, the mutation may have made the virus more capable of infecting human cells, increasing the chance of transmission and potentially leading to more cases of illness. Two hundred people dying as a direct result of the mutation seems less likely than the virus simply becoming more contagious."}}
{"Q": "He understood some expressions of human experience. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is an expert in maths. (B) The man read the book of religions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Reading a book of religions would expose the man to various expressions of human experience, including those related to spirituality, morality, and ethics. This could have helped him understand and empathize with different perspectives and experiences. On the other hand, being an expert in maths (choice A) would not necessarily contribute to understanding human experience."}}
{"Q": "My kidney got injured with impaird functions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My vertebrae was injured. (B) The nurse said I have Hypertension.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a known risk factor for kidney damage and impaired kidney function. When blood pressure is consistently high, it can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to decreased kidney function and potential injury. In contrast, while a vertebral injury could potentially impact the kidneys if it affected the spinal cord or nerve supply to the kidneys, it is less likely to be the primary cause of kidney injury and impaired function."}}
{"Q": "He had to take the consequences of his attempt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He attempted to kill his wife. (B) The policeman aimed to realize his dream.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person attempted something that had negative consequences, and the only option that fits this description is choice A, where the person attempted to kill his wife. This action would have serious consequences, both legally and morally, and the person would have to face them. Choice B, where a policeman aims to realize his dream, does not fit the context of the sentence and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She found a turkey merchant to buy some. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mom's restaurant lack turkeys. (B) The doctor was checking the radial canals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mom's restaurant lack turkeys.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that the woman was looking for a turkey merchant to buy some turkeys. The reason for this is given in the sentence itself, which is that Mom's restaurant lacked turkeys. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is unrelated and does not make sense in the given context."}}
{"Q": "It turns out there is resistance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John wanted to improve his health. (B) The coach put dynamometers on the swimmers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The coach put dynamometers on the swimmers.\nExplanation: The use of dynamometers to measure the swimmers' resistance would likely cause resistance among the swimmers. They may feel uncomfortable or restricted by the equipment, leading to a decrease in motivation or willingness to participate. On the other hand, John's desire to improve his health would not necessarily cause resistance among others."}}
{"Q": "Tom's train was driving on the orbit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has to follow the change of space constantly. (B) He bought another ticket  when the train passed by the center.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Since Tom's train was driving on the orbit, it means that the train was moving in a circular path around a central point. Therefore, Tom would have to constantly follow the change of space and direction as the train moved along the orbit. Option B, which suggests that Tom bought another ticket when the train passed by the center, does not make sense in the context of the given information."}}
{"Q": "The body could not be identified. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The police found a cremated body. (B) The body was exposed to bugs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The body was exposed to bugs.\nExplanation: If a body is exposed to bugs, they can consume the flesh and make it difficult to identify the remains. This is a common occurrence in cases where a body has been left outside for an extended period of time or has not been discovered for a while. On the other hand, if the police found a cremated body, it would be easy to identify the remains through dental records or DNA testing. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He focused on the definition. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mathematician met a math problem. (B) The teacher introduced glossaries.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is A because the sentence suggests that the mathematician's focus on the definition was a result of encountering a math problem that required a clear understanding of the term being defined. Choice B, on the other hand, suggests that the teacher's introduction of glossaries caused the mathematician to focus on the definition, which is less likely to be the case based on the information provided in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Jim put the lactase and lactose together. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim drinks the milk. (B) He found the the lactose was broken down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: When lactase and lactose are put together, lactose is broken down into glucose and galactose. This is because lactase is an enzyme that breaks down lactose, which is a disaccharide made up of glucose and galactose. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jim found the lactose was broken down rather than him drinking the milk, as the lactose would need to be broken down first before it could be consumed by someone who is lactose intolerant."}}
{"Q": "Gluons can be exchanged between quarks. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His design has obvious personal features. (B) Quarks are tightly bound together.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Gluons are the force carriers of the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. Therefore, the exchange of gluons between quarks results in them being tightly bound together. Option A is unrelated to the question."}}
{"Q": "Jack is having an lesson on hieroglyphs in Chinese. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He studies people's dialects in different geographical regions. (B) He learns these small pictures are used to write like alphabet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Hieroglyphs are a form of writing that uses small pictures to represent words or sounds. Learning about hieroglyphs would therefore lead Jack to the understanding that these small pictures are used to write, much like an alphabet. Studying people's dialects in different geographical regions is not directly related to hieroglyphs or Chinese language."}}
{"Q": "He specialized in bees. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is an Apiculturist. (B) He chose phrenology class in university.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom is an Apiculturist.\nExplanation: Apiculture is the study and management of honeybees and their colonies. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom specialized in bees because he is an apiculturist rather than choosing a phrenology class in university, which is the study of the shape and size of the human skull as a supposed indication of character and mental abilities."}}
{"Q": "He admired the vitality of pistachios. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He saw a native plant in the desert. (B) John had cardiovascular disease.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He saw a native plant in the desert.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions pistachios, which are a type of nut. The word \"vitality\" suggests that the speaker is impressed by the energy or life force of the pistachios. Option A is the most plausible answer because it suggests that the speaker saw a native plant in the desert that reminded him of the pistachios. This could have been a plant with similar qualities or characteristics, such as resilience, adaptability, or endurance. Option B, on the other hand, is unlikely because it does not relate to the topic of pistachios or vitality."}}
{"Q": "Tom has difficult in grasping abstract objects. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He cannnot master numbers. (B) He cannnot write numbers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He cannot master numbers.\nExplanation: Difficulty in grasping abstract objects can lead to difficulty in understanding concepts such as numbers, which are abstract in nature. This does not necessarily mean that Tom cannot physically write numbers, but rather that he may struggle with understanding their meaning and how to use them in mathematical operations."}}
{"Q": "Margarines were used to fill the statue. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The statue was heavy. (B) The statue was light.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The statue was heavy.\nExplanation: Margarines are made from vegetable oils and are solid at room temperature. When used to fill the statue, they would have added weight to it, making it heavier. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Soil erosion is serious in this area. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It requires international attention. (B) The government ordered the planting of windbreaks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The government ordering the planting of windbreaks is a more plausible answer as it directly addresses the issue of soil erosion by preventing wind from carrying away the topsoil. While soil erosion may require attention from international organizations, it is more likely that the local government would take immediate action to address the issue."}}
{"Q": "Antidepressants in his drugstores has the highest sales volume. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The chemical structure of inert substances are very stable. (B) Tom sells Antidepressants and other prescribed medications of good quality in US.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom sells Antidepressants and other prescribed medications of good quality in the US, which has led to high sales volume. This suggests that there is a high demand for these medications, and Tom's drugstore is meeting that demand with quality products. The chemical structure of inert substances being stable is not a relevant factor in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "He was given vegetarian meals at the hospital. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has eaten a lot of statins. (B) A vegetarian was hospitalized after a car accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because it directly relates to the fact that the person was given vegetarian meals at the hospital. If a vegetarian was hospitalized after a car accident, it would make sense for them to be given vegetarian meals during their stay. Option A, on the other hand, does not provide a clear reason for why the person would be given vegetarian meals."}}
{"Q": "They showed great perseverance in the face of difficulty. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They achieved their goals. (B) They found a base.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They achieved their goals.\nExplanation: Perseverance means to continue working towards a goal despite facing obstacles and difficulties. Therefore, it is likely that the individuals who showed great perseverance were able to overcome the challenges they faced and ultimately achieve their goals. Option B, \"They found a base,\" does not seem to be a logical outcome of perseverance in this context."}}
{"Q": "Willlows are ubiquitous in this region. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The soil in this region is moist. (B) Woodlouses can have a sense of hunger.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Willows are known to thrive in moist soil conditions, and this region is likely to have such conditions, which is why willows are ubiquitous in this area. Option B, which talks about woodlouses having a sense of hunger, is not related to the growth of willows and is an irrelevant option."}}
{"Q": "Tom is very anxious these days. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Doctor advised him to eat more grapefruits. (B) Bread can satisfy him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Doctor advised him to eat more grapefruits.\nExplanation: Anxiety is a mental health condition that can cause physical symptoms such as digestive issues. However, bread is not typically recommended as a solution for anxiety. On the other hand, grapefruits are a good source of vitamin C, which can help reduce stress and anxiety. Therefore, it is more plausible that a doctor would recommend eating more grapefruits to help manage anxiety."}}
{"Q": "I had smallpox when I was a child. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I know how suffering viral diseases are. (B) It is normal for capuchins to do so.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Smallpox is a highly contagious and potentially deadly viral disease that causes severe symptoms such as fever, rash, and scarring. Surviving smallpox can leave a lasting impact on a person's health and well-being, including physical and emotional scars. Therefore, it is plausible that someone who had smallpox as a child would have a firsthand understanding of the suffering caused by viral diseases. Option B, on the other hand, is not relevant or plausible in this context as it refers to capuchins, a type of monkey, and does not provide any explanation or connection to the question."}}
{"Q": "The caterpillar waited a long time to pupate. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It eventually became a butterfly. (B) Then it will grow rapidly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It eventually became a butterfly.\nExplanation: When a caterpillar waits a long time to pupate, it means that it is taking its time to develop and mature. Eventually, it will form a chrysalis and undergo metamorphosis, transforming into a butterfly. Option B is not a plausible answer as growth occurs during the larval stage, not during pupation."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes eating soft food especially marine products. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His mother usually cooks whelks for him. (B) Tom often buys avocados.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Since Tom likes eating marine products, his mother usually cooks whelks for him. This is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to Tom's preference for soft food and marine products. Buying avocados does not necessarily relate to Tom's preference for soft food and marine products."}}
{"Q": "Mary is learning the greek alphabet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The first letter he learns is alpha. (B) The first letter he learns is A.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The first letter he learns is alpha.\nExplanation: The Greek alphabet starts with the letter alpha, so it is more plausible that Mary would learn this letter first rather than the letter A, which is the first letter in the English alphabet."}}
{"Q": "An argali appeared in front of the hunter. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hunter followed it to find more of them. (B) Instinct leads him to a normal protein.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The hunter followed it to find more of them.\nExplanation: It is likely that the hunter, being a hunter, would be interested in finding more of the same type of animal to hunt. Therefore, it is plausible that he would follow the argali to try and find more of them. Option B, on the other hand, does not make sense in this context as it is not clear how instinct would lead the hunter to a \"normal protein.\""}}
{"Q": "Thyroxine were not produced. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His thyroids were exsected. (B) The food bought by the merchant was damaged in transit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His thyroids were exsected.\nExplanation: Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. If the thyroids were exsected (surgically removed), then the body would not be able to produce thyroxine, leading to a deficiency. On the other hand, the food bought by the merchant being damaged in transit would not have any direct effect on the production of thyroxine in the body."}}
{"Q": "They make weapons every year. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cochlear implant is a common implant. (B) The villagers are afraid of fierce beasts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The villagers are afraid of fierce beasts.\nExplanation: The production of weapons every year suggests that the villagers are preparing for a potential threat or danger, which in this case is the fierce beasts. It is a common practice for communities to arm themselves for protection against wild animals or potential attacks from other groups. Cochlear implant, on the other hand, is a medical device used to improve hearing and is not related to the production of weapons."}}
{"Q": "Now he is more than five kilometers away from where he started. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has been running for half an hour. (B) He was walking on the road.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He was walking on the road.\nExplanation: If Tom had been running for half an hour, it is unlikely that he would have only traveled five kilometers. On the other hand, if he was walking on the road, it is plausible that he could have covered five kilometers in that time."}}
{"Q": "He found that they acted like blankets. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He observed the layers. (B) John wanted to interview the scavengers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The cause of him finding that they acted like blankets was because he observed the layers. This suggests that he noticed the way the layers of the scavengers were arranged and how they provided warmth, similar to how a blanket would."}}
{"Q": "Pecans appeared on this list. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The teacher asked the students to sum up the properties of a certain vegetable. (B) The researchers tried to make a list of the world's largest fruit trees.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Pecans are not a vegetable, but a type of nut. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would appear on a list of vegetable properties. It is more plausible that the teacher asked the students to sum up the properties of a certain type of nut, which included pecans."}}
{"Q": "This patient had a generalized  acute viral disease caused by the mumps virus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The patient was diagnosed with the ischemia. (B) He was assigned to the ward of mumps.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He was assigned to the ward of mumps.\nExplanation: Mumps is a viral disease that causes swelling of the salivary glands, fever, headache, and muscle aches. It is highly contagious and can spread through coughing, sneezing, or sharing utensils with an infected person. Therefore, patients with mumps are usually isolated in a separate ward to prevent the spread of the disease to other patients. Ischemia, on the other hand, is a condition where there is a lack of blood flow to a particular organ or tissue, which is not related to mumps."}}
{"Q": "Black's colleagues suggested that he talk about fundamentalism to his students. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has talents in English. (B) Black's history class is about the way ancient people expressed their politics.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The suggestion to talk about fundamentalism to Black's students was likely made because it is relevant to the topic of his history class, which is about the way ancient people expressed their politics. It is unlikely that Black's colleagues suggested this topic because of his talents in English, as that would not be directly related to the subject matter of his class."}}
{"Q": "She found vertebrae in its structure. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The docter looked at the meninge part as the brain coverings on the patient's CT. (B) Jessy saw a picture of spine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The presence of vertebrae in the structure suggests that the doctor mistakenly identified the meninge part as the brain coverings on the patient's CT scan, when in fact it was a section of the spine. This could have been a simple error or a misinterpretation of the image. Jessy seeing a picture of the spine is not a likely cause for finding vertebrae in a brain scan."}}
{"Q": "In case of danger, they choose the self-amputation of a body part to escape. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Some insects are good at hiding themselves. (B) Some insects have strong regeneration ability of leg autotomy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Some insects have strong regeneration ability of leg autotomy.\nExplanation: Leg autotomy is the ability of some insects to voluntarily shed their legs as a defense mechanism. This allows them to escape from predators or other dangers. However, the insects are able to regenerate the lost leg over time. Therefore, self-amputation of a body part is a plausible and effective strategy for some insects to survive in dangerous situations. Choice (A) is not directly related to the behavior of self-amputation."}}
{"Q": "Tom plugged in the electricity to the machine. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found that the light was bend. (B) Only then did the machine gears start to turn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Only then did the machine gears start to turn.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because plugging in the electricity would provide power to the machine, allowing it to function. The fact that the machine gears started to turn indicates that the machine was successfully powered on. Option (A) about the light being bend does not make sense in this context and is not a logical result of plugging in electricity to a machine."}}
{"Q": "Jack is taking a typing class. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is majoring in biology. (B) Jack's work requires printed papers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Jack's work requires printed papers suggests that he needs to improve his typing skills in order to produce these papers efficiently. On the other hand, Tom majoring in biology has no direct connection to Jack taking a typing class."}}
{"Q": "The engineer hoped the water could be carried to his city. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He finally succeeded. (B) He bulilt a canal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He built a canal.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the engineer had a hope or a plan to bring water to his city. The use of the word \"hoped\" implies that it was not yet a reality. Therefore, it is more likely that he took action to make his hope a reality, such as building a canal, rather than simply succeeding without any effort."}}
{"Q": "Tom just had sex with his girlfriend. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is very excited now. (B) Some semen was left in the condom after his ejaculation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Some semen was left in the condom after his ejaculation.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it is a common occurrence during sexual activity with a condom. It is important to properly dispose of the condom to prevent any potential health risks. The option of being very excited is subjective and not necessarily a guaranteed result of sexual activity."}}
{"Q": "It is difficult to develop. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This mathematical problem is too complicated. (B) The project lacks financial support.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. This mathematical problem is too complicated.\nExplanation: Developing something can be difficult for various reasons, but lack of financial support is not necessarily a cause for difficulty in development. In this case, the statement specifically mentions that it is difficult to develop, which implies that there are technical challenges involved. Therefore, option A, which suggests that the mathematical problem is too complicated, is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said that he was infected by the single-celled protozoan parasite. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom got trichomoniasis. (B) The water in the pond where Tom swam was contaminated by a special kind of bacteria.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom got trichomoniasis.\nExplanation: Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a single-celled protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. It is more likely that Tom contracted the infection through sexual contact rather than from contaminated water in a pond. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ions have net charges. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ions are the same as atoms. (B) Ions are different from atoms.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Ions are different from atoms.\nExplanation: Atoms are electrically neutral, meaning they have an equal number of protons and electrons. However, when an atom gains or loses electrons, it becomes an ion with a net positive or negative charge. This means that ions are different from atoms because they have a different number of electrons and a net charge."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a veteran. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He works much harder than his soldier time. (B) He needs proper treatment to secure his health.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: As a veteran, Tom may have experienced physical and mental trauma during his time in service. This can lead to long-term health issues that require proper treatment and care. It is important for veterans to receive the necessary support and resources to maintain their health and well-being. While Tom may work hard in his civilian life, his health should be a top priority."}}
{"Q": "They use bread from the planet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Human beings need nutritious food for their survival. (B) There are heterotrophs on that planet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There are heterotrophs on that planet.\nExplanation: Heterotrophs are organisms that cannot produce their own food and rely on consuming other organisms for energy. If there are heterotrophs on the planet, it is likely that there are plants or other organisms that produce food for them. Bread could be made from the grains or fruits of these plants, providing a source of food for the human beings on the planet. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not explain why bread specifically is being used from the planet."}}
{"Q": "This branch grew well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He implanted a branch of another tree in this trunk. (B) The farmer has splited some alars into the garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The second option is more plausible as it suggests that the farmer has intentionally planted some apple trees in the garden, which would explain why the branch grew well. Option A is not a common practice and would not necessarily result in a healthy branch growth."}}
{"Q": "Tom has bought a lot of fruits in yellow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His mother told him that these fruits are guavas. (B) People can't buy fruits.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Tom's mother identified the yellow fruits as guavas. This is a more plausible answer as it is common for people to mistake fruits for others, especially if they are not familiar with them. Option B is not a logical consequence of Tom buying yellow fruits."}}
{"Q": "Animals and plants breathe in gases. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Animals and plants need to breathe to survive. (B) Strontium disappers from the earth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Animals and plants need to breathe to survive.\nExplanation: Animals and plants require oxygen for respiration, which is the process of converting food into energy. They also release carbon dioxide as a waste product. This exchange of gases is essential for their survival. Strontium has no direct relation to the breathing process of animals and plants. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The property called the police. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There were several burglaries in this neighborhood. (B) The police actively catch the criminal murderers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There were several burglaries in this neighborhood.\nExplanation: The fact that the property called the police suggests that there was some kind of criminal activity or threat. Option A is more plausible as it specifically mentions burglaries, which is a common reason for people to call the police. Option B, on the other hand, is less likely as catching murderers is not typically the primary responsibility of local police departments."}}
{"Q": "Night was deep. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Today they've been eaten by yellowtail fishing. (B) Cockroaches came out for food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Cockroaches came out for food.\nExplanation: Cockroaches are nocturnal insects and are known to come out at night in search of food. The deep night would provide them with the perfect opportunity to scavenge for food without being disturbed. On the other hand, the option about being eaten by yellowtail fishing seems unlikely and lacks context or relevance to the given situation."}}
{"Q": "The chain lost some of its producers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Autotrophs in this food chain all dissappeared. (B) Tom died.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If all the autotrophs in the food chain disappeared, then there would be no producers left for the chain. Without producers, the rest of the chain would not be able to survive and would eventually die off. This is a more plausible explanation than Tom dying, as the loss of one individual would not necessarily cause the entire chain to collapse."}}
{"Q": "The experimenter made an observation at the lower troposphere. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found many snakes hiding there. (B) He discovered the smog.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the experimenter discovered the smog as the lower troposphere is where air pollution tends to accumulate. Finding many snakes hiding there is not a logical conclusion based on the given information."}}
{"Q": "Sam ate too much and felt bloated in his stomach. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam has been burping. (B) Sam needed to seek advice from his friends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Sam has been burping.\nExplanation: When someone eats too much, their stomach becomes full and can cause discomfort. This discomfort can lead to burping as the body tries to release the excess gas in the stomach. Seeking advice from friends is not a likely result of feeling bloated."}}
{"Q": "Tom bit his lower lip with his front teeth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fortuneteller told Tom he had freckles. (B) He made the pronunciation of \"f\".", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When Tom bit his lower lip with his front teeth, he made the pronunciation of \"f\" sound. This is because the front teeth are used in the production of the \"f\" sound, and biting the lower lip with them can cause the sound to be unintentionally produced. The fortuneteller telling Tom he had freckles is not related to the action of biting his lip."}}
{"Q": "Sloths still walk the slowest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Twenty years have passed since the massacre. (B) Put the sloth and the rabbit together.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Sloths have evolved to move slowly in order to conserve energy and avoid detection by predators. Their slow movement also allows them to blend in with their surroundings and avoid being noticed by potential prey. In contrast, rabbits have evolved to move quickly in order to escape predators and find food. Therefore, putting a sloth and a rabbit together would highlight the stark difference in their evolutionary adaptations for movement."}}
{"Q": "He is not likely to see weasels. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom usually goes out in the daytime. (B) Tom always eat apples with their peel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Weasels are nocturnal animals, meaning they are active at night. Since Tom usually goes out in the daytime, it is unlikely that he will see weasels. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, is irrelevant to the sighting of weasels."}}
{"Q": "His new friends went to his hometown and observed it interestedly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John traveled in a great environment. (B) Mario described his hometown to his new friends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of his new friends being interested in his hometown was because Mario described it to them. If John had traveled in a great environment, it would not necessarily make his hometown interesting to his friends. However, if Mario had described his hometown to his friends, it would pique their interest and make them want to observe it."}}
{"Q": "This horror film tells the story of innocent girls buried alive by ignorant villagers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Emily suffers from dermatosis because of watching this horror movies. (B) Emily suffers from tsunamis because of watching this horror movies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Emily suffers from dermatosis because of watching this horror movie.\nExplanation: The plot of the horror film suggests that innocent girls were buried alive by ignorant villagers. This storyline is unlikely to cause tsunamis in the viewer. However, watching a horror movie can cause psychological distress, which can manifest in physical symptoms such as dermatosis (skin disorders). Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John explored the altitude variation of swamp. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found very high topographic relief. (B) He found very low topographic relief.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He found very low topographic relief.\nExplanation: Swamps are typically low-lying areas with slow-moving water and a flat topography. Therefore, it is more plausible that John found very low topographic relief while exploring the altitude variation of a swamp."}}
{"Q": "Biologists study everything related to biology. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dysprosium is one of their study objects. (B) Biologists never study anything about dysprosium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The statement that biologists study everything related to biology does not necessarily mean that they study every single object or element in the world. Dysprosium, for example, is a rare earth element that is not directly related to biology, so it is unlikely that biologists would study it extensively. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man left the sediment of wine for him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This boy loves lees. (B) This boy loves wine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that the man left the sediment of wine for him because the boy loves wine. Sediment in wine is not typically desirable, so it is unlikely that someone would leave it for someone who does not enjoy wine."}}
{"Q": "He kept many waterfowls. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He fed them with the same food everyday. (B) He prepared different foods for them everyday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If the person kept many waterfowls, it would be difficult and impractical to prepare different foods for them every day. Therefore, it is more plausible that he fed them with the same food every day."}}
{"Q": "He was incarcerated in the state prison. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is guilty of rape and murder. (B) He applied to the personnel department.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom is guilty of rape and murder.\nExplanation: The sentence \"He was incarcerated in the state prison\" implies that Tom was convicted of a crime and sentenced to prison. Option A provides a plausible reason for his incarceration, while option B does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Tom's heart beat again. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to borrow a loan from the bank. (B) Defibrillation was applied to resuscitate Tom whose heart nearly stopped.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Defibrillation is a medical procedure used to restore normal heart rhythm in cases of cardiac arrest or arrhythmia. It involves delivering an electric shock to the heart, which can cause the heart to beat again. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it explains the medical intervention that was used to resuscitate Tom's heart. Option A, on the other hand, is not related to any medical intervention and does not provide a plausible explanation for Tom's heart beating again."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a Chinese expatriate in Spain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom likes Spanish food very much. (B) Tom is not a Chinese citizen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Being a Chinese expatriate in Spain means that Tom is a Chinese citizen living in Spain. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer as it correctly states that Tom is not a Chinese citizen. Option A is not necessarily true as liking Spanish food is a personal preference and not necessarily a result of being a Chinese expatriate in Spain."}}
{"Q": "Jerry's rabbit is dead. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The veterinarian diagnoses that Jerry's rabbit is sick. (B) Lila was sitting under an apple tree.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Without any additional information, it is more likely that the rabbit's death was caused by an illness diagnosed by a veterinarian rather than Lila sitting under an apple tree. The latter scenario does not provide a clear cause-and-effect relationship and seems unlikely to be the cause of the rabbit's death."}}
{"Q": "Ticks can detect the gas given off by these animals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are some colugos. (B) Ticks is sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Ticks are known to be sensitive to the smell of warm-blooded animals, as they use this sense to locate potential hosts for feeding. This ability allows them to detect the carbon dioxide and other gases given off by animals, making them more likely to find a suitable host. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A, which mentions colugos, is not relevant to the question and does not provide a logical explanation for the ticks' ability to detect animal gases."}}
{"Q": "The worker was cutting the wood. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gibbons are resting on the tree. (B) He gains a lot of cellulose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the choices are plausible. \nExplanation: The question does not provide any information about what happened as a result of the worker cutting the wood that would lead to either gibbons resting on a tree or the worker gaining cellulose. Therefore, neither choice is a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The geography teacher was studying the location of the oceans. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They found it on a thinner, heavier crust. (B) They discovered that there are no seas on Earth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They found it on a thinner, heavier crust.\nExplanation: The location of the oceans is related to the Earth's crust, which is divided into oceanic and continental crust. The oceanic crust is thinner and denser than the continental crust, and it underlies the oceans. Therefore, it is plausible that the geography teacher found that the oceans are located on a thinner, heavier crust. Option B is not a plausible answer as it contradicts the well-known fact that there are seas and oceans on Earth."}}
{"Q": "Maria is very generous. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She can create fine jewelry. (B) She is willing to keep connect with others.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Being generous means being willing to give and share with others. Therefore, it is more plausible that Maria's generosity would result in her being willing to keep in touch with others, rather than being able to create fine jewelry."}}
{"Q": "The doctor gave Lucy the same stethoscope she had given to Tom who had a cold. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She refused the treatment. (B) Lucy has a cold.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is possible that Lucy could have contracted the cold from Tom if the stethoscope was not properly sanitized before being used on her. This is a common way for illnesses to spread in medical settings. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy has a cold rather than refusing treatment altogether."}}
{"Q": "He always studes about occult. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is a person filled with occultism. (B) Tom is a student majoring in metrology.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Tom is studying occult suggests that he is interested in the subject and has chosen to study it as part of his academic pursuits. Option A suggests that Tom is inherently drawn to occultism, which may not necessarily be the case. Option B is a more plausible answer as it provides a logical reason for Tom's interest in the subject."}}
{"Q": "He was not a trained professional in that field. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom did not have preparation. (B) The pharmacist only had a fake degree.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom did not have preparation.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Tom simply did not have the necessary education or training to be considered a professional in that field. It is more likely than the alternative answer that the pharmacist had a fake degree, as this would be a rare occurrence and would require more evidence to support."}}
{"Q": "Tom is an experienced doctor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Patients trust Tom. (B) His violets only bloom in autumn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Patients trust Tom.\nExplanation: It is logical to assume that an experienced doctor would have gained the trust of his patients over time due to his expertise and successful track record in treating them. The fact that Tom is an experienced doctor implies that he has been practicing medicine for a significant amount of time, which would have allowed him to build a reputation and establish a rapport with his patients. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that patients trust Tom. Option B is irrelevant and does not make sense in the given context."}}
{"Q": "Alice suffers from claustrophobia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She fears to taking the elevator. (B) To help him, he put a flower, lavender, under his pillow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She fears taking the elevator.\nExplanation: Claustrophobia is the fear of enclosed spaces. Therefore, it is more plausible that Alice would fear taking the elevator, which is an enclosed space, rather than someone putting a flower under their pillow to help her."}}
{"Q": "The experimenter found that the data conclusion was the same as the speed of light. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The student majoring in physics has measured theresistance of each part. (B) The experimenter is testing the speed at which electric energy comes down the metal ladder.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the data conclusion being the same as the speed of light is likely due to the experimenter testing the speed at which electric energy comes down the metal ladder. This suggests that the experiment was likely measuring the speed of electricity, which is known to be very close to the speed of light. The resistance of each part, as mentioned in choice A, would not necessarily have a direct impact on the speed of electricity."}}
{"Q": "Mary saw its unsual teeth. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He ate a whole cantaloupe. (B) Mary saw the colugo open its mouth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that Mary saw the colugo open its mouth, revealing its unusual teeth. Option A, that the colugo ate a whole cantaloupe, does not explain why its teeth are unusual."}}
{"Q": "John had his joint dislocated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The joint effusion inside has fast diffusion pathways. (B) Tom's tooth was avulsed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: When a joint is dislocated, the ligaments and other soft tissues that hold the joint in place are stretched or torn, causing damage to the joint capsule. This damage can lead to joint effusion, which is the accumulation of fluid within the joint. The fast diffusion pathways in the joint effusion allow for rapid movement of fluid and can contribute to swelling and inflammation in the affected area. Tom's tooth being avulsed is not related to John's joint dislocation and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The princess wanted the flowers in all minerals. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her follower brought her gems. (B) She booked a ticket of a zoo.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her follower brought her gems.\nExplanation: Since the princess wanted flowers in all minerals, it is not possible to find flowers in all minerals as minerals are inorganic substances. Therefore, her follower brought her gems which are minerals and can be used to make jewelry or decorative items."}}
{"Q": "Societies have legislations. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Societies can preserve these genetic codes generation by generation. (B) They've had problems.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They've had problems.\nExplanation: While legislations are put in place to regulate and maintain order in societies, they are not foolproof and can have flaws or loopholes that lead to problems. Additionally, enforcing legislations can be difficult and may require resources that some societies may not have. Therefore, it is more plausible that societies have had problems as a result of legislations rather than being able to preserve genetic codes generation by generation."}}
{"Q": "Testers test the toxicity of manganese compounds. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Among them the researcher found the toxic oxidants. (B) Test showed that permanganates is the highest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Test showed that permanganates is the highest.\nExplanation: Based on the given information, testers conducted tests on the toxicity of manganese compounds. The result of the test showed that permanganates had the highest toxicity level among the tested compounds. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A is not relevant to the given information as it talks about the researcher finding toxic oxidants, which is not mentioned in the question."}}
{"Q": "He found the sunflwer will change its direction with the change of the sun's direction. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has grown a sunflower in his garden. (B) Tom observed the sun through a microscope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The cause of the sunflower changing its direction with the change of the sun's direction is most likely due to the sunflower's natural behavior of heliotropism, which is the tendency of plants to grow towards the sun. Choice A suggests that Tom has grown a sunflower in his garden, which is a more plausible scenario for observing this behavior than choice B, which suggests observing the sun through a microscope."}}
{"Q": "Tom cheated Jane's money by lying. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He never eats junk food or any other unhealthy food. (B) Jane was heartbroken when finding Tom's lies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Jane was heartbroken when finding Tom's lies.\nExplanation: Since Tom cheated Jane's money by lying, it is likely that Jane would feel betrayed and hurt when she found out about the lies. Option A, which talks about Tom's eating habits, is not related to the situation and seems irrelevant. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Cannibalism seems to have been acceptable in the earliest times. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Prevalent phenomena are usually acceptable at that time. (B) Spiny coats can hurt fingers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: In the earliest times, humans were still evolving and developing their moral and ethical codes. Cannibalism may have been acceptable because it was a prevalent phenomenon at the time, and humans may not have had the same level of empathy and understanding of the value of human life as we do today. As societies developed and evolved, cannibalism became less acceptable and was eventually outlawed in most cultures."}}
{"Q": "I close the windows in advance so that the thunders won't scare me. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I know there will be some lightings tonight. (B) I am sitting in the library.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions thunders, which are usually accompanied by lightning. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker knows there will be lightning tonight and is closing the windows in advance to avoid being scared by the sound of thunder. Sitting in the library does not provide any explanation for the speaker's behavior."}}
{"Q": "Tom often has a sore throat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom gets a fever. (B) Tom is an orator.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tom's frequent sore throat is more likely to be caused by his profession as an orator, which involves speaking for extended periods of time and straining his vocal cords, rather than getting a fever."}}
{"Q": "He fell ill. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is going to date with his beloved girl. (B) He has overworked himself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He has overworked himself.\nExplanation: Overworking oneself can lead to exhaustion and weakened immune system, making one more susceptible to illnesses. This is a more plausible cause of falling ill compared to going on a date with a beloved girl."}}
{"Q": "There are some mites on the skin of poultry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The poultry was injured. (B) Tom did an exfoliation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The poultry was injured.\nExplanation: Mites on the skin of poultry can cause irritation, itching, and feather loss, which can lead to injuries such as wounds and infections. This can also affect the overall health and productivity of the poultry. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B, which suggests that Tom did an exfoliation, is not relevant to the situation and is unlikely to be a result of mites on the skin of poultry."}}
{"Q": "Tons of insects will be eaten. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is planning to make a feast. (B) Microbats come out at night looking for food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Microbats are known to feed on insects, and they are active at night when insects are also active. Therefore, it is more plausible that the tons of insects will be eaten by microbats rather than Tom planning to make a feast."}}
{"Q": "Tom has curly hair. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's son has curly hair. (B) His parents prepared some ginger for him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom's son has curly hair.\nExplanation: Curly hair is a genetic trait that can be passed down from parents to their offspring. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's son inherited his curly hair rather than his parents preparing ginger for him as a result of his curly hair."}}
{"Q": "Doctors explain that the incidence rate of AIDS is increasing recently. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many people get AIDS every year. (B) The number of existing cases of this virus has been great in last month.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The cause of the increasing incidence rate of AIDS is likely due to the fact that many people are getting infected with the virus every year. This could be due to a variety of factors such as lack of education about safe sex practices, limited access to healthcare and testing, and stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS. It is important for individuals to take preventative measures such as using condoms and getting tested regularly to help decrease the spread of the virus."}}
{"Q": "Stundents wanted to know which was the least abundant of the naturally occurring rare earth element. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher told them it was thulium. (B) Their study conclude promethium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The teacher provided the answer to the students' question. Option B is less plausible because it suggests that the students conducted their own study and came to a different conclusion than the teacher, without any further information provided."}}
{"Q": "The seller recommends him an apartment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants a house where he can dry his clothes. (B) The specialist was unemployed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The reason for the seller recommending an apartment is because Tom wants a house where he can dry his clothes. This implies that Tom is looking for a place with a balcony or outdoor space where he can hang his clothes to dry, which is more commonly found in apartments rather than houses. The fact that the specialist was unemployed is irrelevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "The wind is too strong. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Trees are blown down by wind. (B) It has difficulty in flying.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Trees are blown down by wind.\nExplanation: When the wind is too strong, it can cause trees to be uprooted or have their branches broken off. This is a common occurrence during severe storms or hurricanes. While it is possible for some birds to have difficulty flying in strong winds, it is less likely to be the result of the wind being too strong."}}
{"Q": "The United States is a capitalist country. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The vast majority of officials in its government are men. (B) Its society advocates private ownership.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Capitalism is an economic system that advocates for private ownership of the means of production and distribution of goods and services. Therefore, it is more plausible that the society in a capitalist country like the United States would advocate for private ownership rather than the gender of officials in its government."}}
{"Q": "People can read a total of my travel experience. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wrote a book of tourism. (B) Lucy has more ideas than Tom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I wrote a book of tourism.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because writing a book of tourism would be a logical reason for people to read about someone's travel experiences. It is a common practice for travel writers to share their experiences in the form of a book, which can be read by others who are interested in traveling to the same destination or learning about the author's experiences. On the other hand, the second choice about Lucy having more ideas than Tom is not related to the question and does not provide a logical explanation for why people would read about someone's travel experience."}}
{"Q": "George is cleaning his room. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found many snakes hiding there. (B) He sneezes from time to time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He sneezes from time to time.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that George would experience some allergies or dust while cleaning his room, causing him to sneeze from time to time, rather than finding many snakes hiding in his room."}}
{"Q": "The results showed that the wallaby were the right animal. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom searched the Internet for unique little megapods. (B) Tom searched the Internet for flying animals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom searched the Internet for unique little megapods.\nExplanation: The word \"wallaby\" suggests that Tom was looking for a type of marsupial, which is a unique little megapod. Searching for flying animals, as in choice B, would not necessarily lead to the discovery of wallabies as they are not known for their flying abilities. Therefore, choice A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The doctor extracted some from nerve fibers in follicle walls surrounding oocytes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The treatment needs Serotonin. (B) The experimenter wants to extract some barium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The treatment needs Serotonin.\nExplanation: Nerve fibers are responsible for transmitting signals between cells, and serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating mood, appetite, and other bodily functions. It is possible that the doctor is extracting nerve fibers to obtain serotonin for a treatment that requires it. Barium, on the other hand, is a heavy metal that is not typically found in nerve fibers or follicle walls surrounding oocytes, making option B less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Tom's family grows buckeyes and chestnut trees. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They have a lot in common. (B) It uses wood as its raw material.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They have a lot in common.\nExplanation: Buckeyes and chestnut trees are both types of trees that produce nuts. Therefore, it is likely that Tom's family has found similarities in the way they care for and harvest these trees, as well as similarities in the market for their products. It is not mentioned in the question that they use wood as a raw material, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He cut down the trunk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack cut off the roots of the plant. (B) The worker has found a rowan.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Cutting down the trunk of a plant usually requires cutting off the roots first. Therefore, option A is a more plausible cause for the trunk being cut down. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear reason for why the trunk was cut down."}}
{"Q": "The curtain factory ran out of materials. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) These products didn't function as they used to do. (B) It couldn't produce any curtain.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It couldn't produce any curtain.\nExplanation: If the curtain factory ran out of materials, it wouldn't be able to produce any curtains until it restocked its supplies. Option A doesn't make sense as the question doesn't mention any existing products that would be affected by the lack of materials."}}
{"Q": "He began to examine east asian success. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's colleagues and boss treat him nicely and respect him as himself in the new company. (B) Tom joined in the team of the Economists.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that Tom began to examine east asian success, which suggests that he joined the team of Economists who are likely studying the economic success of East Asian countries. Choice A is not relevant to the sentence and does not explain why Tom is examining East Asian success."}}
{"Q": "The farmed stayed and waited for spring. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Spiny coats can hurt fingers. (B) A heavy rain can revive the farm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions waiting for spring, which implies that the farm is in a dormant state during winter. A heavy rain can revive the farm by providing much-needed moisture for the crops to grow. On the other hand, spiny coats hurting fingers is not a strong enough reason for the farmer to stay and wait for spring."}}
{"Q": "Jack ate comfrey by mistake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Then he had rashes on his skin. (B) He was poisoned.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Comfrey is known to cause skin irritation and rashes when ingested or applied topically. While it can be toxic in large amounts, it is unlikely that Jack would have been poisoned from eating a small amount by mistake. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He found that it had a haploid nuclei. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He studied the origin of equations. (B) The teacher observed the mycelium under the microscope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The observation of the mycelium under the microscope led to the discovery of the haploid nuclei. The origin of equations is not related to this observation."}}
{"Q": "My mom had a headache. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She has to absorb water every once in a while. (B) I treated her with aromatherapy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: If someone has a headache, it is more likely that they would seek some form of treatment or relief, such as taking medication or trying a natural remedy like aromatherapy. Option A, which suggests that the person needs to drink water, may be a helpful suggestion for preventing headaches in the future, but it does not address the immediate issue of the headache. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His mother bought an electric mixer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to made some cider. (B) Tom likes to drink smoothies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom likes to drink smoothies, as an electric mixer is commonly used to make smoothies. Making cider would require a different type of equipment, such as a press, so option A is less likely to be the cause of the purchase."}}
{"Q": "Jack wants to eat risotto. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He went to buy rice and meat. (B) He went to buy some fruit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He went to buy rice and meat.\nExplanation: Since risotto is a dish made with rice and often includes meat, it is more plausible that Jack would go to buy rice and meat in order to make the dish. Buying fruit would not be necessary for making risotto."}}
{"Q": "He added stipes later. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wrote a study on epiphytes. (B) Tom drew a blank American flag.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The addition of stripes is a characteristic of the American flag, so it is more plausible that Tom added stripes to his drawing of the flag rather than being influenced by a study on epiphytes."}}
{"Q": "It made a difference in its life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My company always meets the commitments made to customers. (B) The microbe has a spore-containing structure called capsule.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The statement suggests that something positive happened in the life of the subject, which implies a positive impact. Option A, which states that the company always meets its commitments to customers, is more plausible as it suggests that the subject may have been a customer of the company and had a positive experience. Option B, which talks about a microbe's capsule, is not relevant to the statement and does not provide a plausible explanation for the subject's positive experience."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said his lungs were not healthy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom often smokes. (B) Tom smokes all the year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom often smokes.\nExplanation: Smoking is a major cause of lung damage and can lead to various respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. The word \"often\" suggests that Tom is a regular smoker, which increases his risk of developing lung problems. On the other hand, option B is not a grammatically correct sentence and does not provide any additional information about Tom's smoking habits."}}
{"Q": "They vary in size. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments. (B) Farmers plant a great number of heveas every year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The size variation is likely due to the fact that myofibrils, which are the contractile units of muscle cells, can have different numbers of myofilaments. Myofilaments are the protein filaments that slide past each other during muscle contraction, and the number of myofilaments within a myofibril can affect its size. Therefore, it is more plausible that the variation in size is due to differences in myofilament numbers rather than farmers planting heveas (which are rubber trees and not related to muscle cells)."}}
{"Q": "It is a leech. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An eight-inch-long creature is attaching to Tom's leg and sucking blood. (B) An 18-inch-long creature is attaching to Tom's leg and sucking blood.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: While leeches can grow up to 18 inches in length, it is much more common to encounter smaller leeches that are around 8 inches long. Therefore, it is more plausible that an eight-inch-long leech is attaching to Tom's leg and sucking blood."}}
{"Q": "I advised my son to be an internist. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My father is an evolutionist. (B) I think specialists in internal medicine are helpful.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the speaker thinks specialists in internal medicine are helpful, which is why they advised their son to become an internist. Choice A, which mentions the speaker's father being an evolutionist, is not relevant to the advice given to the son."}}
{"Q": "An animal ate a yew leaf. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The animal was poisoned. (B) He has a stomachache.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The animal was poisoned.\nExplanation: Yew leaves contain a toxic substance called taxine, which can cause severe poisoning in animals if ingested. Symptoms of yew poisoning in animals include vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, seizures, and even death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the animal was poisoned rather than just having a stomachache."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said that deleterious but variable consequence is fibrosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary's doctor told her that she needed flavonoids to treat her illness. (B) She suffers from chronic inflammation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Fibrosis is a condition where excess fibrous connective tissue is deposited in an organ or tissue, leading to scarring and loss of function. Chronic inflammation is a known cause of fibrosis, as the body's immune response can lead to the accumulation of scar tissue over time. Flavonoids, while they may have some health benefits, are not directly related to the development of fibrosis. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "They need to build a furnace. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) But paramecium is an exception. (B) They brought a boiler firstly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the subject needed to build a furnace, and as a result, they brought a boiler firstly. This implies that they may have encountered some difficulties or obstacles in building the furnace, leading them to opt for a boiler instead. Option A is unrelated and does not provide a logical explanation for the situation."}}
{"Q": "The patient improved with tears. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor told the patient that crying was not a bad thing. (B) Tom suffered from the lung cancer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the patient improved with tears, which suggests that the patient was previously experiencing emotional distress or sadness. Option A does not provide a clear reason for why the patient would improve with tears, whereas option B suggests that the patient's tears may have been a release of emotions related to their illness, leading to a sense of relief or catharsis. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He looked for manuals of the phone. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted to know how to use the smartphone. (B) Tom wanted to know how to sell the smartphone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom wanted to know how to use the smartphone.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom is looking for manuals of the phone suggests that he is trying to learn how to use it. If he wanted to sell the phone, he would not need the manuals as he would not be using it himself. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This student suffers from nearsightedness. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly. (B) Soon his vision began to suffer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is a condition where a person can see nearby objects clearly but has difficulty seeing distant objects. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it accurately describes the result of the student's nearsightedness. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is too vague and does not provide a specific outcome related to nearsightedness."}}
{"Q": "This crop field is always very cold due to frost. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The owner of this field build green houses. (B) The owner of this field build an animal farm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The owner of this field build green houses.\nExplanation: Greenhouses are structures that can regulate temperature and protect crops from frost. It is a more plausible solution than building an animal farm, which would not address the issue of the cold temperature in the field. Therefore, building greenhouses would be the more logical choice for the owner to protect their crops."}}
{"Q": "A glaucoma patient asked the doctor about the cause. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor performed a heart operation on the patient. (B) The doctor said it was because the drainage outlet was blocked and the internal pressure increased.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The doctor's response in option B is the most plausible answer as it is a well-known fact that glaucoma is caused by increased pressure in the eye due to a blockage in the drainage outlet. Option A, on the other hand, is completely unrelated to the question and seems like an unlikely scenario."}}
{"Q": "Flying insects affect people's rest at night in summer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People are praying for more corns this year. (B) People are praying for more bats this year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Bats are natural predators of flying insects and can help control their population. Therefore, it is more plausible that people would pray for more bats to reduce the number of flying insects and improve their rest at night in summer. Praying for more corns does not have any direct correlation with the issue of flying insects affecting people's rest."}}
{"Q": "Tom has been practicing table tennis since he was a boy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's body is getting stronger and stronger. (B) Later, he became an Olympic champion of table tennis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: While practicing table tennis since childhood may have contributed to Tom's physical fitness, it is not a guarantee that his body is getting stronger and stronger. However, becoming an Olympic champion of table tennis is a more plausible result of years of practice and dedication."}}
{"Q": "The boss tried to calculate the cost of the company this month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The accountant told the boss that don't forget to take the benefits into account. (B) The boss suspected that someone had misappropriated company funds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The accountant's reminder to take benefits into account is a common and reasonable consideration when calculating company costs. On the other hand, the suspicion of misappropriation of funds is a serious accusation that requires evidence and investigation, and is less likely to be the immediate result of a routine cost calculation."}}
{"Q": "The results of the study showed that it was the interstitial cells. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) DAG failed in the R-cells. (B) Scientists are studying between which cells the sperm is produced.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The study found that it was the interstitial cells that produced sperm, indicating that DAG did not fail in the R-cells. Choice B is not relevant to the findings of the study. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He opened the refrigerator door. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The rich boy wanted to see the sample. (B) Jack want to eat ham.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Jack wanted to eat ham, as opening the refrigerator door is a common action taken when looking for food or drinks. Option A, that the rich boy wanted to see the sample, is not a likely reason for opening a refrigerator door."}}
{"Q": "Scientists detect the acidity and alkalinity of volcanism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists invented echolocation system. (B) Scientists have detected different pH values from 0 to 12.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Scientists have been able to detect different pH values from 0 to 12 in volcanic activity, which has helped them better understand the chemistry and behavior of volcanoes. This information can be used to predict eruptions and assess potential hazards to nearby communities. However, this discovery did not lead to the invention of an echolocation system, which is a completely unrelated technology."}}
{"Q": "Tourist hiked for 3 hours. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) All of them sweated a lot. (B) They made observations on the mountain during the day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the tourists made observations on the mountain during the day as a result of hiking for 3 hours. While sweating is a natural response to physical activity, it is not necessarily the only outcome of hiking. Making observations on the mountain is a more likely result as it is a common activity for tourists who hike."}}
{"Q": "Mitochondria in the cell were divided into two. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They developed in this way. (B) It began to construct earthen cells.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They developed in this way.\nExplanation: Mitochondria are organelles that are responsible for producing energy in the cell through cellular respiration. When a cell divides, the mitochondria also divide and are distributed between the two daughter cells. This ensures that each new cell has the necessary energy-producing organelles to carry out its functions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the mitochondria would develop in this way rather than beginning to construct earthen cells, which is not a known function of mitochondria."}}
{"Q": "The sheep was killed by the lions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sheep must be a prey in those lions. (B) The shepherd's sheep ran into the orchard by mistake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Lions are known predators and often hunt and kill prey animals such as sheep. Therefore, it is more plausible that the sheep was killed because it was a prey animal for the lions rather than it accidentally running into an orchard."}}
{"Q": "The apple is rotten. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tm has found a chinchilla in the mountain. (B) He threw a whole apple into the warm and humid garbage dump.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because throwing a whole apple into a warm and humid garbage dump can cause it to rot due to the presence of bacteria and other microorganisms that thrive in such conditions. On the other hand, finding a chinchilla in the mountain (choice A) has no direct correlation with the apple being rotten."}}
{"Q": "The cops replied, \"Small children.'. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) No creatures could infected by the flytraps. (B) He asked the cops what they had seen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He asked the cops what they had seen.\nExplanation: The question is incomplete and lacks context. However, based on the given options, it can be inferred that the person asking the question had asked the cops what they had seen, and the cops replied that they had seen small children. This suggests that there was an incident involving small children that the cops had witnessed, and it is unrelated to the flytraps or any creatures being infected."}}
{"Q": "The school assumes the responsibility of taking care of the safety of students on campus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The school encourages students to bring knives to campus. (B) Teachers forbid the students to run around in the campus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Teachers forbid the students to run around in the campus.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the school would take measures to prevent accidents and injuries on campus, such as forbidding students to run around, rather than encouraging them to bring weapons. The school's responsibility for student safety would likely lead to stricter rules and regulations to ensure a safe learning environment."}}
{"Q": "This material is easy to bent. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The producer needs a special kind of material to make the kettle. (B) This material has excellent flexibility.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement \"This material is easy to bend\" suggests that the material has excellent flexibility, which is a characteristic of some materials. Choice (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not explain why the material is easy to bend."}}
{"Q": "She becomes a vegetarian. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The lady wants to live a longer and healthier life. (B) She is a brave woman.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The lady wants to live a longer and healthier life.\nExplanation: Becoming a vegetarian is often associated with health benefits such as lower risk of heart disease, cancer, and other chronic illnesses. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lady became a vegetarian for health reasons rather than simply being brave."}}
{"Q": "These children's lives are full of happiness. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The teacher provided them with a variety of pedons. (B) The government and families strive to guarantee the underlying values of children.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The government and families strive to guarantee the underlying values of children.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the children's lives are full of happiness, which implies that they have a positive environment and upbringing. While pedons (which may be a typo for \"lessons\") provided by the teacher may contribute to their education, it is unlikely to be the sole cause of their happiness. On the other hand, the government and families' efforts to ensure the underlying values of children, such as love, care, and support, can create a nurturing environment that fosters happiness and well-being. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He has to complete an optical design. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He uses mechanical instruments. (B) He uses optical instruments.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He uses optical instruments.\nExplanation: Since the task at hand is an optical design, it is more plausible that the person would use optical instruments to complete it. Mechanical instruments may not be suitable for this task as they are designed for mechanical engineering and not for optical design."}}
{"Q": "His mom bought him a cup pf yougurt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack had stomach cramps. (B) The child's intestinal gurgling needed some help.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Jack had stomach cramps, as yogurt is often recommended as a soothing food for upset stomachs. The second choice, that the child's intestinal gurgling needed some help, is less likely as it is not a common reason for buying yogurt."}}
{"Q": "Heis skin got a rash. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was exposed to some nickel. (B) Tom gets a fever.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He was exposed to some nickel.\nExplanation: Nickel is a common cause of skin rashes and allergic reactions. It is often found in jewelry, coins, and other metal objects. If someone has a rash after coming into contact with nickel, it is likely that they are allergic to it. On the other hand, Tom getting a fever is not related to the cause of the rash."}}
{"Q": "They stand still. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists put beryllium and iron together. (B) This tunner has time limitation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The given options do not provide enough context to determine the cause of the people standing still. However, option B suggests that there may be a time limitation for the tunner, which could be a plausible reason for people to stand still. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact cause."}}
{"Q": "But we handled them sucessfully and made historical decelopment. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There were no problems in China's economy during 1970s. (B) China's economy were faced with many problems during 1970s.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: China's economy was faced with many problems during the 1970s, including a lack of modern infrastructure, low productivity, and a shortage of foreign exchange. However, the Chinese government implemented various economic reforms, such as the opening up of the economy to foreign investment and the establishment of special economic zones, which helped to spur economic growth and development. Additionally, the government's emphasis on education and technological innovation also played a significant role in China's economic success."}}
{"Q": "Cactus stems can prick our fingers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Areoles on stems can protect our skin. (B) Areoles on stems can prick our skin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Areoles on stems can prick our skin.\nExplanation: Areoles are small, raised structures on cactus stems that contain spines or thorns. These spines are used by the cactus as a defense mechanism against predators. When we touch or brush against the cactus, the spines can easily penetrate our skin, causing pain and sometimes even injury. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of cactus stems pricking our fingers is due to the presence of spines on the areoles rather than their ability to protect our skin."}}
{"Q": "The vet provided my dog with Adjuvants. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The veterinarian diagnosed that his dog had a gastrointestinal disease. (B) The stimulation of the appropriate protective immune response was boosted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Adjuvants are substances that are added to vaccines to enhance the body's immune response to the vaccine. They work by stimulating the appropriate protective immune response, which helps the body to recognize and fight off the disease-causing agent. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer. Option A is not related to the use of adjuvants in vaccines."}}
{"Q": "Mr Li wanted to illustrate Enantiomers with examples. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He read about some examples. (B) He enumerated a pair of chemical substances.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Enantiomers are pairs of molecules that are mirror images of each other but cannot be superimposed. Mr Li would have illustrated enantiomers by providing a pair of chemical substances that are enantiomers of each other. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer. Option A is not a plausible answer as reading about examples alone would not have helped Mr Li illustrate enantiomers."}}
{"Q": "Tom ate Prednisone. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He then got dehydrated. (B) He has a stomachache.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He has a stomachache.\nExplanation: Prednisone is a steroid medication that can cause stomach irritation and discomfort as a common side effect. Dehydration is not a typical side effect of prednisone, so option A is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "There was pregnancy on this woman. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tests revealed that her placenta strongly stimulated progesterone. (B) A small baby was born in her family.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. A small baby was born in her family.\nExplanation: Pregnancy typically results in the birth of a baby, so option B is the most plausible answer. Option A may be a possible result of pregnancy, but it is not a direct consequence of the pregnancy itself."}}
{"Q": "All cells in the cell culture medium die. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The circuit is closed. (B) The scientist injected the cytotoxin into the cell culture medium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the scientist injected a cytotoxin into the cell culture medium, which caused all the cells to die. A cytotoxin is a substance that is toxic to cells, and if it is added to a cell culture medium, it can kill all the cells in the culture. On the other hand, a closed circuit would not necessarily cause all the cells to die, as there are many other factors that can affect cell survival in a culture. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of the cell death."}}
{"Q": "He would lead the chorus at every church service. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is the cardinal of this church. (B) The priest called all the Christians together.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The priest called all the Christians together.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is common for a priest to lead a church service and call all the Christians together. It is not necessary for the person leading the chorus to be a cardinal, as that is a high-ranking position in the Catholic Church and not every church has a cardinal."}}
{"Q": "Lina inflates the balloon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The ballon flies away. (B) The ballon is heavier.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The balloon is heavier.\nExplanation: When Lina inflates the balloon, she is adding air to it, which increases its mass and therefore makes it heavier. The balloon is unlikely to fly away unless it is released or there is a strong gust of wind."}}
{"Q": "There is grass on alpine steppes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Yaks were fed on alpine steppes. (B) Chameleons can survive this long.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Yaks were fed on alpine steppes.\nExplanation: Yaks are known to graze on alpine steppes, which are characterized by grassy vegetation. The presence of grass on alpine steppes provides a food source for yaks and other grazing animals that inhabit these regions. Chameleons, on the other hand, are not typically found in alpine environments and would not be able to survive in such harsh conditions. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The nurse loves taking care of patients. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She often saw their weakness. (B) He is fond with food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She often saw their weakness.\nExplanation: Since the nurse loves taking care of patients, she would spend a lot of time with them and observe their health conditions closely. This would make her notice their weaknesses or vulnerabilities, which could help her provide better care and support to them. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the given statement."}}
{"Q": "Zoologists found a hyena. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After a while there were a lot of hyenas. (B) He tested its reflectivity for know its power.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. After a while there were a lot of hyenas.\nExplanation: If zoologists found a hyena, it is unlikely that they would test its reflectivity to know its power. Instead, they would study its behavior, habitat, and reproduction. As hyenas are social animals, it is possible that the zoologists observed the hyena's social behavior and eventually found a group of hyenas, leading to the presence of many hyenas in the area. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom spun the manure at high speeds with centrifuges. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A kind of Emulsion was produced. (B) The effect of gravity was increased.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Centrifugation is a process that separates components of a mixture based on their density. By spinning the manure at high speeds with centrifuges, the denser components of the manure would be forced to the bottom of the centrifuge tube, while the less dense components would remain at the top. This process could result in the production of an emulsion, which is a mixture of two immiscible liquids, such as oil and water. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B is not a likely outcome of centrifugation."}}
{"Q": "Biologists lower the firing threshold of limbic neuron circuits. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They found a lot of radium. (B) Biologists have discovered that dissociation has occurred.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Biologists have discovered that dissociation has occurred.\nExplanation: Lowering the firing threshold of limbic neuron circuits can lead to dissociation, which is a state of altered consciousness or detachment from one's surroundings. This can be seen in conditions such as depersonalization disorder or dissociative identity disorder. The other option, finding a lot of radium, is not related to the topic of limbic neuron circuits or their firing threshold."}}
{"Q": "John raised some chinchillas. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He classified them into five groups. (B) He kept the chinchillas locked up at night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John kept the chinchillas locked up at night to ensure their safety and prevent them from escaping or being harmed by predators. Classifying them into five groups may not necessarily be a direct result of raising chinchillas."}}
{"Q": "Mary prepared dinners for those boatmen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She cooked some vegetables. (B) They enjoyed the delicious food very much.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They enjoyed the delicious food very much.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Mary prepared dinners for the boatmen, implying that they ate the food she cooked. The sentence does not provide any information about the type of food Mary cooked, but it does state that the boatmen enjoyed it very much, indicating that the food was delicious. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The kid swallowed a piece of silver by accident. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wasn't poisoned. (B) He got toxic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He wasn't poisoned.\nExplanation: Silver is not toxic when ingested in small amounts. It may pass through the digestive system without causing harm. However, if the piece of silver was large or had sharp edges, it could cause physical damage to the digestive tract. In this case, medical attention should be sought immediately."}}
{"Q": "It has long-term and heavy rainfalls very often in summer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Higher precipitation was recorded this year. (B) This province have frequent flood each summer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Long-term and heavy rainfalls very often in summer can lead to frequent floods in the province. While higher precipitation may be recorded, it is not necessarily the most plausible answer as it does not directly address the impact of the rainfalls on the province."}}
{"Q": "He was amazed at the age and history of these stones. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John discovered some chondrites. (B) Archaeologists repair the ancient writing on the rocks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the amazement was likely due to the fact that archaeologists had repaired the ancient writing on the rocks, revealing their age and historical significance. Chondrites, on the other hand, are meteorites and would not be related to the age and history of stones with ancient writing."}}
{"Q": "He found meiosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His little finger was exsected. (B) He was watching the eukaryotes that were reproducing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Meiosis is a process of cell division that results in the formation of gametes (sex cells) in eukaryotes. It is unlikely that the exsection of a little finger would lead to the discovery of meiosis. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that the scientist observed eukaryotes reproducing and noticed the unique process of meiosis."}}
{"Q": "Stemosis intensified during flexion after that. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Logan's ligamentum flavum was stretched broken during flexion. (B) The Great Depression was a great economic collapse and chaos in America.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Stemosis is a condition where the spinal canal narrows, causing pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Flexion, or bending forward, can exacerbate this condition by further narrowing the spinal canal. Logan's ligamentum flavum is a structure that helps support the spinal column and can become stretched or even torn during flexion, leading to increased pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Therefore, choice A is a more plausible answer than choice B, which is unrelated to the medical condition being discussed."}}
{"Q": "Jack is good at applying extrapolation in the field of stock and finance. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack feels better. (B) By analyzing the economic curve before the stock market disaster in the past, he successfully predicted the financial crisis in 2008.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: By applying extrapolation in the field of stock and finance, Jack was able to analyze the economic curve before the stock market disaster in the past and successfully predicted the financial crisis in 2008. This is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to Jack's expertise in extrapolation and has a concrete outcome. Feeling better is not a logical result of being good at extrapolation in this context."}}
{"Q": "The company took use of the way of telecommuting. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy doesn't need to go to the company any more. (B) Its usability was reduced.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lucy doesn't need to go to the company any more.\nExplanation: Telecommuting allows employees to work from home or other remote locations, reducing the need for them to physically come into the office. Therefore, it is plausible that Lucy no longer needs to go to the company if the company has implemented telecommuting. Option B, stating that the usability was reduced, does not make sense in the context of telecommuting as it is meant to increase flexibility and productivity."}}
{"Q": "Tom wanted to know what is the turbulent flow of air through the glottis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He measured with the unit of megahertz. (B) Finally he looked it up and he knew it was because of aspiration.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tom looked up the term and found out that turbulent flow of air through the glottis is caused by aspiration. Measuring with the unit of megahertz is not relevant to this question."}}
{"Q": "Tom was guided to draw the dominant creature of agriculture in geography class. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom drew some cattle. (B) After consulting the data, he took burrow as an example.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since the prompt mentions that Tom was guided to draw the dominant creature of agriculture in geography class, it is likely that he consulted some data or information before drawing. Therefore, it is more plausible that he took burrow as an example after consulting the data, rather than randomly drawing some cattle without any research or guidance."}}
{"Q": "His instructor tells him to find the arrows followed and he will see the explanations. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mario clearly understands the definitions. (B) Mario can't understand some academic definitions in the online document.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Mario's instructor tells him to find the arrows followed and he will see the explanations suggests that Mario is having difficulty understanding some academic definitions in the online document. If Mario clearly understood the definitions, his instructor would not need to direct him to the arrows for further explanation."}}
{"Q": "My aunt found harmful levels of common bacteria in food. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Other enzymes in her body were activated. (B) She used Pasteurization to kill them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She used Pasteurization to kill them.\nExplanation: Pasteurization is a common method used to kill harmful bacteria in food. It involves heating the food to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time to destroy any harmful microorganisms. Other enzymes in the body being activated would not be a plausible result of finding harmful bacteria in food."}}
{"Q": "He went to wrestling. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was injured. (B) He soon suffered from depression.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the above.\nExplanation: The question does not provide enough information to determine what happened as a result of him going to wrestling. It is possible that he enjoyed it and had a good time, or that nothing significant happened. Therefore, neither option A nor B can be considered plausible answers."}}
{"Q": "The most hazardous chemicals in barns should be kept away from childs. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Childs are not allowed to use bags in the barns. (B) Childs are not allowed to touch disinfectants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Childs are not allowed to touch disinfectants.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because disinfectants are one of the most hazardous chemicals found in barns and can cause harm if ingested or touched. Therefore, it makes sense to prohibit children from touching or using disinfectants to ensure their safety. The use of bags in barns is not directly related to the safety of hazardous chemicals, so option (A) is less likely to be the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "He identified the location of hydroxyl. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom noticed the brightest radiation of all the thermostats. (B) Tom noticed the bleakest  radiation of all the thermostats.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Hydroxyl has a characteristic bright radiation that can be detected by instruments such as spectrometers. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom noticed the brightest radiation of all the thermostats, which led him to identify the location of hydroxyl."}}
{"Q": "He observed the early process of food decomposition. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He saw rapid leaching of carbohydrates. (B) He became experienced.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The observation of early food decomposition would likely involve the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. However, rapid leaching of carbohydrates specifically would be a plausible result as they are often the first macronutrient to break down in food spoilage. Becoming experienced may be a long-term outcome of repeated observations, but it is not a direct result of observing the early process of food decomposition."}}
{"Q": "The doctor said he had spondylolisthesis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor insert a pacemaker for him. (B) The test results showed that his upper vertebra is detached from the lower vertebra.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over the vertebra below it. Therefore, the more plausible answer would be that the test results showed that his upper vertebra is detached from the lower vertebra. Inserting a pacemaker would not be a relevant treatment for this condition."}}
{"Q": "The body needs six key nutrients to thrive. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It can live well. (B) Nutritionists suggest balanced food mix.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Nutritionists suggest balanced food mix.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that in order for the body to thrive, it needs six key nutrients. Therefore, nutritionists suggest a balanced food mix that includes all six nutrients in appropriate amounts to ensure the body receives the necessary nutrients to function properly. A balanced diet is essential for good health and well-being."}}
{"Q": "There is no paper in the printer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The printer can not work normally. (B) The printer can work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The printer can not work normally.\nExplanation: If there is no paper in the printer, it cannot print anything. The printer needs paper to be able to print, so without it, it cannot work normally. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The United States uses anthrax as its main weapon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The United States launched a biological war against Japan. (B) There are many outlaws in the Middle East.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The United States' use of anthrax as a weapon is primarily due to concerns about terrorism and the potential for biological attacks from groups in the Middle East. The U.S. government has invested heavily in developing and stockpiling anthrax vaccines and treatments as a defense against such attacks. There is no evidence to suggest that the U.S. has ever launched a biological war against Japan or any other country."}}
{"Q": "Lucy believed that dinosaurs didn't possess teeth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her happiness disappeared. (B) Her belief was wrong.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Lucy's belief was proven wrong as dinosaurs did possess teeth. This shows the importance of fact-checking and not blindly believing in something without proper evidence or research."}}
{"Q": "This land was invaded. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Weeds swallowed this land. (B) The monster learned to cut its claws.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Weeds swallowed this land.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the land was invaded by weeds rather than a monster learning to cut its claws. Weeds are known to grow rapidly and can quickly overtake an area, causing damage to the ecosystem and potentially making it difficult for other plants and animals to survive. On the other hand, the idea of a monster learning to cut its claws is unlikely and not supported by any known scientific or natural phenomenon."}}
{"Q": "The bulbils have bloomed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bulbils he raised have been growing for two years. (B) I planted bulbils to see their germination.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the bulbils have been growing for two years is a more plausible explanation for their blooming than simply planting them to see their germination. It takes time for bulbils to mature and develop into flowering plants, and two years is a reasonable amount of time for this process to occur. Planting them to see their germination would not necessarily lead to blooming, as germination is only the first step in the growth process."}}
{"Q": "There has been no rain in the countryside for a month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was no phosphate precipitation of iron. (B) The farmer used a hose to draw water out of the well to water the crops.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The farmer used a hose to draw water out of the well to water the crops.\nExplanation: Without rain, the crops would not receive enough water to grow properly. Therefore, the farmer would need to find an alternative source of water to irrigate the crops. Using a hose to draw water out of a well is a common method of irrigation in areas with little rainfall. Option (A) is not related to the lack of rain and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Deltas are rich in natural fertilizer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researchers found ore. (B) Agriculture develops well in deltas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Deltas are rich in natural fertilizer due to the deposition of nutrient-rich sediment carried by rivers. This makes the soil in deltas highly fertile, which is ideal for agriculture. As a result, agriculture develops well in deltas, making it a prime location for farming and food production. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Option A is not related to the topic of natural fertilizer in deltas."}}
{"Q": "He vomited and took in some toxins. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has picked up a meadowlark. (B) The woman had to feed her son with berries.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The woman feeding her son with berries is a more plausible cause of vomiting and toxin ingestion as some berries can be toxic if not properly identified and prepared. Picking up a meadowlark may not necessarily lead to vomiting and toxin ingestion."}}
{"Q": "The scientist studies water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Some people learned how to make beers with top fermenting yeasts from him. (B) He is a hydrologist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Since the scientist studies water, it is more plausible that he is a hydrologist, which is a scientist who studies the properties, distribution, and effects of water on the Earth's surface, in the soil and rocks, and in the atmosphere. Choice A, on the other hand, seems unrelated to the study of water and lacks context or explanation."}}
{"Q": "He put into some tomatoes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to color his soup. (B) Tom has grown some seeds in his garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom has grown some seeds in his garden.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Tom has grown tomatoes in his garden and is now using them in his cooking. Option A, on the other hand, does not make much sense as adding tomatoes to soup would not necessarily change its color significantly."}}
{"Q": "Jessy tried to use words to modify a noun and a verb. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She selected an adjective for noun and an adverb for verb. (B) She selected an adjective for verb and an adverb for noun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Jessy used an adjective to modify a noun, which is the correct use of an adjective, and an adverb to modify a verb, which is the correct use of an adverb. Adjectives describe or modify nouns, while adverbs describe or modify verbs. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She feels coolness in summer and warmth in winter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy lives by the side of Neoprene. (B) Amy lives by the side of Iceland.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Amy lives by the side of Iceland.\nExplanation: Iceland is known for its cool climate, even in the summer months, due to its location near the Arctic Circle. In the winter, the country experiences long periods of darkness and cold temperatures. Therefore, it is more plausible that Amy's feeling of coolness in summer and warmth in winter is due to her living by the side of Iceland rather than Neoprene, which is a synthetic rubber material commonly used in wetsuits and not known for affecting the temperature of its surroundings."}}
{"Q": "He quickly accepted the culture of eating sashimi. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has good cultural adaptability. (B) He went to a cllege.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the person quickly accepted the culture of eating sashimi, which implies that he has good cultural adaptability. Going to college is not necessarily a factor in developing cultural adaptability."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's father was dignosed with the atherosclerosis many years ago. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It is very dangerous for her to have children at this age. (B) Lucy was diagnosed with atherosclerosis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Atherosclerosis is a condition that affects the arteries and can lead to heart disease, stroke, and other complications. However, it is not a hereditary condition that can be passed down from parent to child. Therefore, it is unlikely that Lucy's father's diagnosis of atherosclerosis would have any direct impact on her ability to have children or her own risk of developing the condition."}}
{"Q": "Tom keeps the laborator at room temperature. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Hydrogen perxoide tends to be unstable here. (B) When the woman was newly pragnant, she suffered from the rubella virus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Tom keeps the laboratory at room temperature, which suggests that there is a reason for doing so. Choice A provides a plausible explanation as hydrogen peroxide is known to be unstable at higher temperatures and may decompose more quickly, leading to potential safety hazards. Choice B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the temperature of the laboratory and does not provide a logical explanation for Tom's actions."}}
{"Q": "This farmer wants to build a fish pond. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He cuts off some grass. (B) The farmer found a suitable area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The farmer found a suitable area.\nExplanation: Building a fish pond requires a suitable area with enough space and water supply. Therefore, it is more plausible that the farmer found a suitable area rather than just cutting off some grass."}}
{"Q": "It is based on the principle of movement of air. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The experiment is to realize imitation of Thunder. (B) Propanol is a simple example of isomer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The principle of movement of air is related to the experiment of realizing imitation of Thunder. Thunder is caused by the rapid expansion of air due to the heat generated by lightning. This expansion creates a shock wave that moves through the air, resulting in the sound of thunder. The experiment involves creating a similar shock wave by igniting a mixture of propane and air, which rapidly expands and creates a loud noise similar to thunder. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B is unrelated to the principle of movement of air."}}
{"Q": "A state of false pregnancy was established in her body. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The progestin implanted in Lucy's body lost efficacy. (B) The progestin implanted in Lucy's body worked.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The progestin implanted in Lucy's body worked.\nExplanation: Progestin is a hormone that is commonly used in birth control implants to prevent pregnancy. It works by thickening the cervical mucus, which makes it difficult for sperm to reach the egg. It also thins the lining of the uterus, which makes it less likely for a fertilized egg to implant and grow. In rare cases, progestin can cause a state of false pregnancy, also known as pseudocyesis. This is because the hormone can mimic the symptoms of pregnancy, such as missed periods, nausea, and breast tenderness. Therefore, it is more plausible that the progestin implanted in Lucy's body worked and caused the state of false pregnancy."}}
{"Q": "We honored a kind of peaceful reconciliation of human difference. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) War ceased to bring us gunshots. (B) We hold the belief of pacifism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. We hold the belief of pacifism.\nExplanation: Honoring peaceful reconciliation of human difference means that we have chosen to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence. This promotes the belief of pacifism, which is the opposition to war or violence as a means of resolving disputes. It does not necessarily mean that war has completely ceased, but rather that we have chosen a different approach to conflict resolution."}}
{"Q": "His body has a poor untake of amino acids. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor recommended that he take a supplement of arginine to help depolarization of gut cells to improve. (B) The nutritionist advised him to eat more legumes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The nutritionist advised him to eat more legumes.\nExplanation: Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are essential for the growth and repair of tissues in the body. If the body has a poor uptake of amino acids, it may not be getting enough protein to support these functions. Legumes are a good source of plant-based protein and can help increase the intake of amino acids. While arginine is an amino acid that can help with gut health, it may not be the most appropriate solution for poor uptake of amino acids overall. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I cooked Fucus vesiculosus for my father. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His thyroid function was promoted for more intake of iodine. (B) He wasn't poisoned.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Fucus vesiculosus, also known as bladderwrack, is a type of seaweed that is commonly used in traditional medicine for its high iodine content. However, consuming large amounts of bladderwrack can lead to iodine toxicity, which can cause adverse effects on thyroid function. Therefore, it is important to consume bladderwrack in moderation and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. As there is no information provided on the amount of bladderwrack consumed or the individual's health status, it is more plausible to assume that the father was not poisoned rather than his thyroid function being promoted."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's dog has suffered the brucellosis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It cannot be a mother any more. (B) He is no longer constipated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It cannot be a mother any more.\nExplanation: Brucellosis is a bacterial infection that can cause infertility in dogs, particularly in females. Therefore, Lucy's dog may not be able to reproduce or be a mother anymore due to the infection. Option B, about constipation, is not related to brucellosis and is an irrelevant answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom's banjo doesn't work any more. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He changed the string and it works again. (B) Tom's bone is in a state of hyperextension.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Tom changed the string, it is likely that the banjo would work again. On the other hand, Tom's bone being in a state of hyperextension has nothing to do with the banjo not working. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The user of the soap tried to obtain such a  fragrant resin from trees. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The soap I made contained Myrrh. (B) It was sunny yesterday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The soap I made contained Myrrh.\nExplanation: Myrrh is a fragrant resin that is commonly used in soap making. Therefore, it is more plausible that the user was trying to obtain Myrrh to use in their soap rather than the weather being a factor."}}
{"Q": "The doctor prescribed some more delavirdine for him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The medicine prescribed by the doctor before Tom did not work. (B) The doctor advised Jack to eat more food containing amino acids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The medicine prescribed by the doctor before Tom did not work.\nExplanation: The fact that the doctor prescribed more delavirdine suggests that the previous prescription did not work as intended. Delavirdine is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection, and if the initial prescription was effective, there would be no need for additional medication. Option B, which suggests that the doctor advised Jack to eat more food containing amino acids, is not relevant to the prescription of delavirdine."}}
{"Q": "The filter-feeding shellfish ate some algae containing toxins. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Yield disadvantage was shown. (B) Toxins remain concentrated in the shellfish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Filter-feeding shellfish, such as mussels and oysters, can accumulate toxins from the algae they consume. These toxins can remain concentrated in the shellfish, making them potentially harmful to humans if consumed. This is why there are regulations in place to monitor and control the levels of toxins in shellfish harvested for human consumption. There is no mention of yield disadvantage in the scenario given."}}
{"Q": "The purpose is to prevent trichinosis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This factory dares to innovate and uses robots for production. (B) The doctor said that we should not undercooked and raw pork.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Trichinosis is a disease caused by a parasite called Trichinella spiralis, which can be found in undercooked or raw pork. Therefore, the cause of preventing trichinosis is to avoid consuming undercooked or raw pork, as advised by doctors. The use of robots in a factory has no direct relation to the prevention of trichinosis."}}
{"Q": "Officers need to go through professional training before taking up the post. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A sage took the lead in surrendering. (B) When we come across an emergency, we should call for professional help from officers in time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that officers need professional training before taking up their post, implying that they will be better equipped to handle emergencies and provide professional help when needed. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer as it emphasizes the importance of seeking help from trained officers during emergencies. Option A is not related to the statement and seems irrelevant."}}
{"Q": "The viper is the most poisonous one. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This species had significant mutations in last century. (B) There are a lot of various animals in the forest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement about the viper being the most poisonous one does not mention anything about mutations. Therefore, option A can be ruled out. Option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the viper has evolved to be the most poisonous due to competition with other animals in the forest. This could have led to the development of stronger venom as a means of survival and defense."}}
{"Q": "Tom is practicing quadrille for dancing with his girlfriend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is going to join a party. (B) Soon there will be an important international dance competition.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom is practicing quadrille with his girlfriend suggests that he is preparing for a social event, such as a party, where he will need to dance. Option B, which suggests an international dance competition, seems less likely as it is unlikely that Tom would be practicing with just his girlfriend for such a high-level competition. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He often eats psyllium. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has been suffering from diarrhea recently. (B) He is still healthy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Psyllium is a type of soluble fiber that absorbs water and can help regulate bowel movements. However, if consumed in excess or without enough water, it can lead to constipation or diarrhea. Since the statement mentions that he often eats psyllium, it is more plausible that he has been suffering from diarrhea recently as a result."}}
{"Q": "Their descendants must be good at adapting to conditions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The biology teacher said that many creatures have a strong ability to adapt to the environment. (B) This enthic group has survived for thoudsands of years.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that this ethnic group has survived for thousands of years suggests that their ancestors were able to adapt to changing conditions and pass on those traits to their descendants. This is a more plausible explanation than the statement made by the biology teacher, which is a general statement about many creatures and does not specifically address this ethnic group."}}
{"Q": "Tom swallowed the bulb. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was poisoned by the active components. (B) Doctor gave him diuretics as cure.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Tom swallowed a bulb, it is likely that he ingested the active components of the bulb, which can be toxic and cause poisoning. Ingesting a bulb can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. It is important to seek medical attention immediately if someone ingests a bulb. Diuretics would not be an appropriate treatment for bulb ingestion."}}
{"Q": "A child sees a piece of cake on the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She tried to sink to yell for it. (B) Saliva flows out of his mouth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Saliva flows out of his mouth.\nExplanation: It is a natural physiological response for the body to produce saliva when we see or smell food. This is because saliva helps to break down food and prepare it for digestion. Therefore, it is more plausible that the child's body would produce saliva in response to seeing the cake rather than trying to sink or yell for it."}}
{"Q": "The boy curiously followed the flow of the creek. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Suddenly it began to rain. (B) He found a river finally.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He found a river finally.\nExplanation: Since the boy was following the flow of the creek, it is likely that he would eventually reach a larger body of water, such as a river. There is no indication in the sentence that it began to rain, so option A is less likely."}}
{"Q": "Materials stored in the factory are of high flammability. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Natural enemies of mite pests are saved. (B) Anything causing fire is not allowed here.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Anything causing fire is not allowed here.\nExplanation: Since the materials stored in the factory are highly flammable, it is important to take precautions to prevent any fire accidents. Therefore, anything that can cause fire, such as smoking, open flames, or electrical sparks, should not be allowed in the factory to ensure the safety of the workers and the materials stored. The presence of natural enemies of mite pests is not related to the flammability of the materials and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Little Emma is four years old. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She can't eat Hamburgs. (B) The doctor confirms that she does not suffer from autism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The doctor confirms that she does not suffer from autism.\nExplanation: The question does not provide any context or information about Little Emma's situation. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what happened as a result of her being four years old. However, it is more plausible that a doctor would confirm or rule out a medical condition like autism rather than a four-year-old being unable to eat hamburgers."}}
{"Q": "She ended her days in poverty. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She had dependency on drugs. (B) The poor lady became our queen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She had dependency on drugs.\nExplanation: Drug addiction can lead to financial instability and poverty as the individual may prioritize their addiction over their financial responsibilities. It is a more plausible explanation compared to the unlikely scenario of a poor lady becoming a queen."}}
{"Q": "Gorge hates the smell of all onions in the onion family. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He dislikes the silicons known as green onions as well. (B) He dislikes the Scallions known as green onions as well.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Scallions are also known as green onions, so it is more plausible that Gorge would dislike them as well since they belong to the onion family. Silicon is not related to onions, so it would not make sense for Gorge to dislike green onions because of their silicon content."}}
{"Q": "People always like to look at the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Suddenly it began to rain. (B) They always sit in the innermost seat of the plane.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Suddenly it began to rain.\nExplanation: The statement implies that people are enjoying the view of the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. However, if suddenly it began to rain, it would disrupt their enjoyment of the view. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer. Option (B) is not related to the statement and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "He was diagnosed with hemias. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom feels his stomach aches. (B) The petechiae on his arm became pimples.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom feels his stomach aches.\nExplanation: Hemias is not a medical condition or term. It is possible that the intended word was hernia, which is a condition where an organ or tissue protrudes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle or connective tissue. Stomach aches can be a symptom of a hernia, so option A is a more plausible cause. Option B, which describes petechiae turning into pimples, is not related to hernias."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought a lot of specialty from Beijing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They offered quality of product. (B) Jack drove a car to pick up Tom and the specialty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They offered quality of product.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that Tom bought a lot of specialty from Beijing, which implies that he found the products to be of good quality and worth purchasing. The statement does not mention anything about Jack driving a car to pick up Tom and the specialty, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His immune system broke down. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John had HIV virus infection. (B) Ruhr's doctors found that Ruhr's white blood cells increased, and has leukocytosis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. John had HIV virus infection.\nExplanation: HIV virus attacks and weakens the immune system by destroying CD4 cells, which are responsible for fighting off infections and diseases. As a result, people with HIV are more susceptible to infections and illnesses that a healthy immune system would normally be able to fight off. Therefore, it is more plausible that John's immune system broke down due to HIV infection rather than leukocytosis, which is an increase in white blood cells and not necessarily indicative of a weakened immune system."}}
{"Q": "He found that they shed half of their exoskeleton each time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Biologists observed the molting of isopods. (B) The biologist has been observing rabbits for years.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Biologists observed the molting of isopods.\nExplanation: The shedding of exoskeletons is a common process in arthropods, including isopods. Therefore, it is more plausible that the biologist observed the molting of isopods rather than rabbits, which do not have exoskeletons."}}
{"Q": "His finger has been stained with the cigarette. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom hurt his fingernails badly in the car accident. (B) He has been smoking cigarettes for four years.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He has been smoking cigarettes for four years.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of his finger being stained with cigarette is that he has been smoking cigarettes for four years. Nicotine and tar from cigarettes can easily stain fingers and nails with prolonged use. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not explain how the cigarette caused the stain on his finger."}}
{"Q": "Vibrations of the vocal cords cause sore rubbing of the throat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lisa's voice changes a lot per second when she sings. (B) Speaking requires the vibration of the vocal cords, which are located in the throat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Speaking and singing both require the vibration of the vocal cords, which are located in the throat. The repeated rubbing of the vocal cords can cause soreness and discomfort in the throat. While choice A may be true, it is not directly related to the cause of soreness in the throat."}}
{"Q": "Faces of all audience watching the horror were projected on the screen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They saw their own pale faces. (B) They saw their own red  faces.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They saw their own pale faces.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the audience would be scared and have pale faces while watching a horror movie, rather than having red faces. Therefore, it is more plausible that they saw their own pale faces projected on the screen."}}
{"Q": "He perceived misery. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has a great sense of apperception. (B) Tom looked at the object representing the pioneers' hardships.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"Tom looked at the object representing the pioneers' hardships,\" which suggests that the cause of his perception of misery was the object he was looking at. Choice A, which suggests that his perception was due to his sense of apperception, is not supported by the sentence."}}
{"Q": "He lost his orientation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The little moose was alonein the forest. (B) The patient's global cerebral functions were affected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of losing orientation is more likely to be related to the patient's global cerebral functions being affected, such as due to a neurological condition or injury. Being alone in the forest may cause disorientation, but it is not a likely cause in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Lucy was doing a research about the material of the underwears. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She found that all of them contain polypropylene. (B) Limestone is the last choice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She found that all of them contain polypropylene.\nExplanation: Polypropylene is a common material used in the manufacturing of underwears due to its moisture-wicking and breathable properties. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lucy found that all of the underwears she researched contained polypropylene rather than limestone, which is not commonly used in underwear production."}}
{"Q": "There are many mosquitoes around Jack's house. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He always carries fluoxetine with him. (B) He bought a lot of mosquito repellent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack bought a lot of mosquito repellent to deal with the mosquito problem around his house. Carrying fluoxetine, which is an antidepressant, would not be a solution to the mosquito problem."}}
{"Q": "The mother feeds the baby milk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The baby kept crying when he was hungry. (B) The baby is full.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the baby kept crying when he was hungry, which prompted the mother to feed him milk. Babies cry as a way of communicating their needs, and hunger is a common reason for crying. Therefore, it is likely that the baby's crying was a signal that he needed to be fed."}}
{"Q": "The crops grow well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A farmer uses a lot of fertilizer to grow his crops. (B) There is a beech in the garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The use of fertilizer is a common and well-known practice to enhance crop growth. On the other hand, the presence of a beech tree in the garden may not necessarily have a direct impact on crop growth. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Emotional stress led to his lower body temperature. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He senstively felt the coldness of his extremities. (B) His parents suspected that he was ill.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: When the body is under emotional stress, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, which can cause vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in the extremities. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow and a sensation of coldness in the affected areas. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person would sensitively feel the coldness of their extremities rather than their parents suspecting illness."}}
{"Q": "He is very ill. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was infected with anthrax. (B) Tom has had a bad digestion recently.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom has had a bad digestion recently.\nExplanation: While anthrax is a serious illness, it is also relatively rare and unlikely to be the cause of someone's illness without additional context. On the other hand, digestive issues are a common cause of illness and can range from mild discomfort to severe illness. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The experimenter selected both kinds of wood. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The experimenter is examining the rays in the wood. (B) The results of the experiments were demonstrated in the paragraph.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence preceding this one mentions that the experimenter is examining the rays in the wood, which suggests that the selection of both kinds of wood is related to this examination. Different types of wood may have different patterns of rays, so examining both kinds would allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the topic."}}
{"Q": "Jackson wanted to study the creatures of the human family. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He raised some money for the cost. (B) Jackson's professor recommended him to study hominids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jackson's professor recommended him to study hominids, as they are the closest living relatives to humans and would be a logical choice for studying the creatures of the human family. Raising money for the cost may be a necessary step, but it is not directly related to the choice of subject matter."}}
{"Q": "No one other than grandma can know the contents of the document. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Grandma and the bank signed a trust agreement. (B) Doctors are discussring the effective treatment measures of corneal neovascularization.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is A because a trust agreement is a legal document that allows a trustee (in this case, the bank) to hold assets for the benefit of a beneficiary (grandma). The terms of the trust agreement can specify that only the beneficiary has the right to access certain information or assets held in the trust. Therefore, it is likely that grandma and the bank signed a trust agreement that restricts access to the contents of the document to only grandma. Option B is not related to the given statement and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom has a healthy heart. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has a good blood circulation in his body. (B) He quickens his respiration rate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He has a good blood circulation in his body.\nExplanation: A healthy heart is responsible for pumping blood efficiently throughout the body, ensuring that all organs and tissues receive the necessary oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, having a healthy heart results in good blood circulation in the body. Quickening of respiration rate is not directly related to a healthy heart, but rather a response to physical activity or stress."}}
{"Q": "Tom's restaurant is not doing well. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He took to the streets to drum up customers. (B) His manager helped him work it out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He took to the streets to drum up customers.\nExplanation: If Tom's restaurant is not doing well, it means that he is not getting enough customers. Therefore, it is plausible that he would take to the streets to try and attract more customers. This could involve handing out flyers, offering discounts, or even setting up a food stand outside the restaurant to entice people to come in. On the other hand, it is less likely that his manager would be able to single-handedly turn the restaurant's fortunes around without some kind of external intervention or change in strategy."}}
{"Q": "Chinese will no longer be bullied. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Racism has been removed. (B) China is getting better and better.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: China's rise as a global economic and military power has led to a shift in the balance of power, making it less susceptible to bullying from other nations. Additionally, China has taken a more assertive stance in defending its interests and sovereignty, which has also contributed to the perception that it will no longer be bullied. While racism may be a factor in some instances, it is not the primary cause of China's newfound confidence on the world stage."}}
{"Q": "The whole classroom burst into laughter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The sound of coughing suddenly appear in the quiet classroom. (B) The sound of farting suddenly echoes in the quiet classroom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The sound of coughing suddenly appear in the quiet classroom.\nExplanation: While both options may be considered humorous, the sound of coughing is a more plausible cause for laughter in a classroom setting. Farting may be seen as inappropriate or immature, while coughing is a more common and relatable occurrence. Additionally, the suddenness of the coughing sound may have caught the students off guard and caused them to laugh."}}
{"Q": "In order to make resonance, Tom tries to shake a tub of water with different frequencies. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The water keeps vibrating without his shaking as he tries the same frequency as the water has. (B) The water stops vibrating immediately even though Tom's shaking frequency corresponds to its own.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The water keeps vibrating without his shaking as he tries the same frequency as the water has.\nExplanation: This phenomenon is known as resonance. When Tom shakes the tub of water with a frequency that matches the natural frequency of the water, the amplitude of the vibrations increases, and the water continues to vibrate even after Tom stops shaking it. This is because the energy from Tom's shaking is transferred to the water, causing it to vibrate at its natural frequency. As a result, the water keeps vibrating without Tom's shaking."}}
{"Q": "There are many molas in the sea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have green appearances. (B) Molas are easily bitten by other fish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that there are many molas in the sea, which implies that they are not a rare species. Therefore, it is more plausible that they are easily bitten by other fish, as they may be a common prey item for larger predators. The statement does not provide any information about the color or appearance of molas, so option A is not a logical conclusion."}}
{"Q": "The teacher suggested that they choose crinoids. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researcher put some spirogyras into the brine. (B) This research needs a sessile animal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The teacher suggested choosing crinoids because the research requires a sessile animal, and crinoids are a type of marine animal that are attached to the ocean floor and do not move around. Choice (A) about spirogyras being put into the brine is not relevant to the teacher's suggestion about choosing crinoids."}}
{"Q": "A few days later, Tom observed the taproot of the grass. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom saw the grass germinate. (B) Tom has buried a lot of unknown seeds in his garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom saw the grass germinate.\nExplanation: Grass typically has a taproot system, which means that the first root to emerge from the seed is a thick, central root that grows straight down into the soil. This taproot is important for anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients. Therefore, it is likely that Tom observed the taproot of the grass after it had germinated, rather than having buried unknown seeds in his garden."}}
{"Q": "Billy is reading about fat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His father tells him it is a mass of lymphatic tissue at the back of the throat. (B) Billy reads about lipids in his reading.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Billy would read about lipids, which are commonly referred to as fats, when reading about fat. It is unlikely that his father would randomly tell him about the mass of lymphatic tissue at the back of the throat in relation to fat."}}
{"Q": "I compared the faces of a cougar and a cat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There is something in commen between them. (B) I thought they have similar faces.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There is something in common between them.\nExplanation: While cougars and domestic cats may have some differences in their facial features, they are both members of the Felidae family and share certain characteristics such as a similar skull structure and facial muscles. Therefore, it is likely that there is something in common between their faces."}}
{"Q": "Jane is a master of Selvage. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The finished lengthwise edges of her fabric works were always wonderful. (B) He removes the outer hard shells sometimes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Selvage refers to the finished lengthwise edges of a fabric that prevent it from unraveling or fraying. Therefore, if Jane is a master of Selvage, it means that she is skilled at creating and maintaining these edges, resulting in her fabric works having wonderful finished lengthwise edges. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the skill of Selvage and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Tom threw a piece of glass onto the quartz. . What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The glass broke into pieces. . (B) The quartz broke into pieces. .", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The glass broke into pieces.\nExplanation: When a piece of glass is thrown onto a hard surface like quartz, it is more likely that the glass will break into pieces rather than the quartz breaking. This is because glass is more fragile and prone to breaking upon impact. Quartz, on the other hand, is a harder and more durable material."}}
{"Q": "The lactating woman took hydrazine. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her breasts become bigger and bigger. (B) The baby had related adverse reactions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The baby had related adverse reactions.\nExplanation: Hydrazine is a toxic chemical compound that is not safe for consumption during lactation. If a lactating woman takes hydrazine, it can pass into her breast milk and be ingested by the baby. This can lead to adverse reactions in the baby, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) is not a possible outcome of taking hydrazine during lactation."}}
{"Q": "Farmers like autumn. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Harvests make farmers tired. (B) Harvests make farmers happy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Harvests make farmers happy.\nExplanation: Autumn is the time when farmers reap the fruits of their labor and harvest their crops. This is the time when they can finally see the results of their hard work throughout the year. Harvesting also means that they will have food to sell and provide for their families, which brings a sense of satisfaction and happiness. Therefore, it is more plausible that farmers like autumn because it brings them joy and a sense of accomplishment."}}
{"Q": "There are many tools in front of the tree. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mammoth is one of them. (B) Tom recognizes the stick at once.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mammoth is one of them.\nExplanation: The sentence only mentions that there are many tools in front of the tree, but it does not provide any information about what happened as a result. Therefore, it is not possible to choose option B. Option A, on the other hand, provides a plausible answer as it suggests that one of the tools in front of the tree is a mammoth, which could be significant or interesting in some way."}}
{"Q": "This thruse has hurt its wings. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The biggest one weighs several hundred pounds. (B) It has difficulty in flying.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It has difficulty in flying.\nExplanation: If a thrush hurts its wings, it is likely to have difficulty in flying as the wings are essential for flight. Option A, stating that the biggest one weighs several hundred pounds, is not relevant to the given situation and seems to be a random fact. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is willing to offer help. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He often assists people. (B) The department accepts his proposal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He often assists people.\nExplanation: If Tom is willing to offer help, it implies that he is open to assisting others. Therefore, it is more plausible that he often assists people rather than the department accepting his proposal, as the latter would depend on various factors and is not necessarily a direct result of Tom's willingness to help."}}
{"Q": "Hellbenders have strong limbs as sea creatures. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have energy to carry out their own life functions. (B) They always walk under the sea.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Hellbenders have strong limbs to help them move and navigate through fast-moving water currents. This allows them to hunt for food, find mates, and defend their territory. The strong limbs also provide them with the energy needed to carry out their own life functions, such as breathing and digesting food. Walking under the sea is not a plausible answer as hellbenders are not sea creatures, but rather live in freshwater habitats such as rivers and streams."}}
{"Q": "The lawn has nitrogen inside. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has collected a lot of leaves. (B) Gardeners offer the lawn enough fertiles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Gardeners offer the lawn enough fertilizers, which contain nitrogen, to promote healthy growth and green color. Leaves can also contribute to nitrogen levels in the soil, but it is less likely to be the sole cause of high nitrogen levels in a lawn."}}
{"Q": "Tom saw a lot of pretty birds in the national park. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom took a visit to the national park. (B) Tom is assertive.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom took a visit to the national park, as this would provide a clear reason for why he saw a lot of pretty birds. Option B, stating that Tom is assertive, does not provide any logical connection to the observation of pretty birds in the national park."}}
{"Q": "Tom has exploring the secret of the nature. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sulfur was found. (B) He found lectins everywhere.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He found lectins everywhere.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom found lectins everywhere as they are a common type of protein found in many plants and animals. Sulfur, on the other hand, is a chemical element that is not typically associated with exploring the secrets of nature."}}
{"Q": "The two soldiers are very anxious. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is a great tension between them. (B) It's easier for the two of them to communicate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It's easier for the two of them to communicate.\nExplanation: When people are anxious, they tend to be more alert and focused on their surroundings. This heightened state of awareness can make it easier for the soldiers to communicate with each other, as they may be more attuned to each other's body language and nonverbal cues. On the other hand, if there is a great tension between them, it may be more difficult for them to communicate effectively due to the emotional strain and potential conflict."}}
{"Q": "Recording polarity is very important in John's experiment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John recorded the the phase of the signal in relation to the string vibration. (B) He recorded a continuum of energies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Recording polarity refers to the direction of the electrical signal in relation to the direction of the sound wave. By recording polarity, John was able to determine the phase of the signal in relation to the string vibration. This is important because it allows for accurate analysis of the sound wave and can help identify any issues or anomalies in the experiment. Recording a continuum of energies would not be directly related to polarity and would not provide the same level of information for the experiment."}}
{"Q": "They had appearances. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This cell had Necrosis. (B) They were all fleshes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Necrosis is a type of cell death that can cause changes in the appearance of tissues or organs. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer than option B, which does not provide a clear explanation for the appearances."}}
{"Q": "John's cheating was discovered by the teacher and his exam was terminated. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John attempted to cheat in the exam. (B) John hit the teacher before the exam.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. John attempted to cheat in the exam.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that John's cheating was discovered by the teacher and his exam was terminated. There is no mention of John hitting the teacher before the exam. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It saves surplus prey. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fox was hunted by hunters. (B) Foxes have been hunting well recently.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Foxes have been hunting well recently.\nExplanation: If foxes have been hunting well recently, it means they have been able to catch more prey than they need for their immediate consumption. This surplus prey can then be saved for later consumption, which is a common behavior observed in many animals. On the other hand, if the fox was hunted by hunters (option A), it would not have any surplus prey to save. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I appreciated the works of the artist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I understood the the objectification of his feeling. (B) I learned how to apply knowledge from him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Appreciating the works of an artist means that you have gained an understanding and appreciation for their expression of emotions and ideas through their art. It does not necessarily mean that you have learned how to apply knowledge from them. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the appreciation of the artist's work has led to an understanding of their emotional expression."}}
{"Q": "The bad guy wants to infere the program. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He needs to be certified by the Finance Bureau. (B) He found some bullies to make destructions to the building.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If the bad guy wants to interfere with the program, it is more plausible that he would resort to destructive means, such as hiring bullies to cause chaos and disrupt the program's operations. It is unlikely that he would need to be certified by the Finance Bureau to carry out his nefarious plans."}}
{"Q": "The researcher made a nitrification. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The researcher wants to oxidize the ammonia into nitrate. (B) The researcher put these kinds of amino acid into the water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The researcher wants to oxidize the ammonia into nitrate.\nExplanation: Nitrification is the process of converting ammonia (NH3) into nitrite (NO2-) and then into nitrate (NO3-) by bacteria. This process is important in the nitrogen cycle and is often used in wastewater treatment to remove nitrogen compounds. Therefore, it is more plausible that the researcher made a nitrification to oxidize the ammonia into nitrate rather than adding amino acids to the water, which would not necessarily lead to nitrification."}}
{"Q": "Everyday there are some germs invading our body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The immunity system defend our body from being ill. (B) We benefit from producers for bad life quality.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The immunity system defend our body from being ill.\nExplanation: When germs invade our body, our immune system recognizes them as foreign and produces antibodies to fight them off. This process helps to protect our body from getting sick and is a natural defense mechanism that our body has developed over time. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B does not make sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "They all have good jobs now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The students in this class have graduated long time ago. (B) People are all happy and rich.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The students in this class have graduated long time ago.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that the individuals referred to in the sentence have good jobs now. The most plausible reason for this is that they have graduated from school and have likely gained the necessary skills and experience to secure good jobs. Option B, \"People are all happy and rich,\" is not a logical explanation as it is too general and does not provide any specific reason for why these individuals have good jobs."}}
{"Q": "He was caught for killing endangered species of Australian marsupials. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This group saw another group end. (B) The Man hunted Bilbies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The Man hunted Bilbies.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the man was caught for killing endangered species of Australian marsupials. Among the given choices, option B is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the act of killing the marsupials. Bilbies are one of the endangered species of Australian marsupials, and hunting them is illegal. Therefore, it is highly likely that the man was caught for hunting Bilbies. Option A, on the other hand, does not provide any direct connection to the act of killing the marsupials."}}
{"Q": "There is a sedge in Tom's garden. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found the sedge was bending. (B) Doctor thinks Tom has insomnia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He found the sedge was bending.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the presence of a sedge in Tom's garden would not have any direct correlation with a doctor diagnosing him with insomnia. However, the sedge bending could indicate a problem with the soil or water in Tom's garden, which would be a more logical result of its presence."}}
{"Q": "The situation in the Middle East is uncertain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Some experts intend to make some assessments. (B) People are making efforts to exploit oil reserves.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Some experts intend to make some assessments.\nExplanation: The uncertainty in the Middle East would likely prompt experts to assess the situation and provide insights or recommendations. Exploiting oil reserves may not necessarily be a direct result of the uncertain situation in the region."}}
{"Q": "Mike lives in a basin. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His distress keeps hime awake during the night. (B) He is used to the seasonal variability.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Mike lives in a basin, it is likely that he is used to the seasonal variability that comes with living in such an area. Basins are known for having distinct seasons, with hot summers and cold winters. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mike is used to these changes rather than being distressed by them."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes to open a new book on the first day of a month. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom can finish reading at least one book a month. (B) He thinks it will help him lose weight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Tom's habit of opening a new book on the first day of a month does not have any direct correlation with weight loss. However, it does suggest that he is an avid reader and sets a goal to finish at least one book a month. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Horticulturists plant heaths and eventually make a sea of flowers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It's time for thrushes to propagate. (B) There is a lot of acidic soil in this place.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Heath plants thrive in acidic soil, so the abundance of acidic soil in the area would be the most likely cause for the successful growth of heaths and the resulting sea of flowers. Choice (A) is not relevant to the growth of heaths."}}
{"Q": "Programmers detect through flows. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The programmer is detecting the data of object movement. (B) Water in terrestrial system has runoff.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Programmers detect through flows because they are analyzing the flow of data within a program or system. They are not concerned with water runoff in terrestrial systems, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The oosperm of a frog is in the egg. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A frog cannot love without water. (B) A tadpole would first feel the world in the pond.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When the oosperm of a frog is in the egg, it undergoes development and hatches into a tadpole. Tadpoles are aquatic and live in ponds or other bodies of water, where they develop and grow before metamorphosing into adult frogs. Therefore, it is more plausible that a tadpole would first feel the world in the pond than a frog not being able to live without water."}}
{"Q": "They mixed cement with water by pouring it into the pit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After stirring for a while, the contents of the pit synthesize new substances and harden. (B) After mixing for a while, water is still water and cement is still cement.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: When cement is mixed with water, a chemical reaction occurs which causes the mixture to harden and form a solid substance. This process is called hydration and it is what allows cement to be used as a binding agent in construction. Therefore, after stirring for a while, the contents of the pit will synthesize new substances and harden, making option A the more plausible answer. Option B is incorrect because it does not take into account the chemical reaction that occurs when cement is mixed with water."}}
{"Q": "Tom has symptoms of keratinization. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor advised Tom to add more nutrition. (B) The doctor suspects that Tom has squamous cell carcinoma.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Keratinization is the process of skin cells becoming hard and forming a protective layer. It is a normal process that occurs in the skin, but excessive keratinization can lead to dry, rough, and scaly skin. In most cases, the treatment for keratinization involves adding more moisture to the skin through the use of moisturizers or increasing water intake. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor advised Tom to add more nutrition to his diet to improve his skin condition rather than suspecting him of having squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of skin cancer."}}
{"Q": "Tom used his prizes as evidence. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's pupils became bigger and he could see clearly. (B) His potential to win another game was demonstrated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His potential to win another game was demonstrated.\nExplanation: Using his prizes as evidence likely showed others that Tom had a track record of winning games or competitions, which could increase his credibility and demonstrate his potential to win future games. It is unlikely that using his prizes as evidence would have any physical effect on Tom's pupils or vision."}}
{"Q": "Harbin Institute of technology is the best school to keep warm in winter in China. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Harbin Institute of technology uniformly installed the building with heat insulation panels. (B) Harbin Institute of technology bought a lot of air conditioners.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Harbin Institute of Technology uniformly installed the building with heat insulation panels, which helps to keep the warmth inside the buildings during the cold winter months. This is a more plausible answer as air conditioners are not typically used for heating in winter, and installing heat insulation panels is a common practice in cold regions to conserve energy and maintain warmth."}}
{"Q": "They will be installed with new facilities. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are many newsstands in this city. (B) Many public utilities in this city were very old.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Many public utilities in this city were very old.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that new facilities will be installed, which implies that the current facilities are outdated or inadequate. Option (B) provides a more plausible reason for this, as it suggests that the public utilities in the city are old and need to be replaced with new ones. Option (A) is not relevant to the sentence and does not provide a logical reason for the installation of new facilities."}}
{"Q": "Pouches can let air in. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Air enters cavities. (B) Each pouch has a cavity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Each pouch has a cavity.\nExplanation: Pouches are typically made of flexible materials that can expand and contract. Each pouch has a cavity that can allow air to enter or escape depending on the pressure inside and outside of the pouch. This is why pouches are often used for packaging products that need to breathe, such as fresh produce or coffee beans. While air can also enter cavities, this is not the most plausible answer in this context as it does not specifically address the issue of pouches letting air in."}}
{"Q": "He was infected with virus. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The patient has been injected with the medicine containing immunization. (B) Insects had contact with his nake wound.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Insects had contact with his nake wound.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the patient was infected with a virus through contact with insects that carried the virus and had contact with his open wound. Injection with immunization medicine would not cause a virus infection."}}
{"Q": "Inside the house is cooler than outside. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather is hot in summer. (B) The temperature in summer and winter is more extreme.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The temperature difference between inside and outside the house is more extreme in summer and winter, which is the cause of the cooler temperature inside the house. This is because the house is insulated and can retain cooler air in summer and warmer air in winter, making it more comfortable inside. Choice (A) is not a plausible answer as it only states the general weather condition and does not explain the temperature difference between inside and outside the house."}}
{"Q": "I could barely see trees around. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was doing experiment on a tundra. (B) The yard was overgrown with weeds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I was doing experiment on a tundra.\nExplanation: Tundra is a biome characterized by low temperatures and short growing seasons, which results in a lack of trees and other vegetation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lack of trees was due to the location being a tundra where trees do not grow naturally, rather than the yard being overgrown with weeds."}}
{"Q": "The Superconductive material can keep the temperature of the circuit. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The conditions in this place are very good. (B) Conducting electricity without resistance won't emit a lot heat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Superconductive materials have the ability to conduct electricity without any resistance, which means that there is no energy loss in the form of heat. This is why the temperature of the circuit can be maintained at a low level, even when a large amount of current is flowing through it. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer. Option A is not a valid explanation as good conditions alone cannot keep the temperature of the circuit low."}}
{"Q": "His encouraging plan had more effectiveness. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boss wants to develop business. (B) The leader's effort had positive effect on the staff.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the plan was encouraging, which suggests that it had a positive impact on the staff. Therefore, it is more likely that the leader's effort had a positive effect on the staff, rather than the boss's desire to develop business, which may or may not have been a factor in the plan's effectiveness."}}
{"Q": "The plane should not fly in troposphere at last. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The plane should fly by only a few feet above the ground. (B) The plane needs to fly smoothly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The plane needs to fly smoothly.\nExplanation: The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, where most weather occurs. It is characterized by strong winds, turbulence, and other atmospheric disturbances that can make flying difficult and dangerous. Therefore, it is important for planes to fly smoothly and avoid the troposphere as much as possible to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. Flying only a few feet above the ground (choice A) would not be a practical solution, as it would limit the plane's range and make it vulnerable to obstacles on the ground."}}
{"Q": "He brought his cat to the vet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was infected at the first time. (B) The vet asserted it has panleukopenia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The vet asserted it has panleukopenia.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because bringing a cat to the vet usually results in a diagnosis or treatment plan. The fact that the vet asserted the cat has panleukopenia suggests that the cat is sick and needs medical attention. Option A is not a likely outcome of bringing a cat to the vet, as it implies that the person who brought the cat was infected with something."}}
{"Q": "The enemy dropped a lethal biological weapon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People inside faced great inconvenience. (B) Many people were infected with anthrax.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Many people were infected with anthrax.\nExplanation: A lethal biological weapon is designed to cause harm and death to a large number of people. Anthrax is a common biological weapon that can be spread through the air and can cause severe illness and death. Therefore, it is more plausible that many people were infected with anthrax as a result of the enemy dropping a lethal biological weapon. People inside facing great inconvenience would not be a significant enough consequence for a lethal biological weapon."}}
{"Q": "Peter was particularly good at cryptanalysis at the military academy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) To some extent, this shows that students have a strong connection with him. (B) During the exercise, he successfully cracked the other party's cryptosystem.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence states that Peter was good at cryptanalysis, which means he had the ability to decipher codes and ciphers. Therefore, it is more plausible that during an exercise, he successfully cracked the other party's cryptosystem, rather than students having a strong connection with him."}}
{"Q": "His trials always fail. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He likes to do trials. (B) He doesn't have a method at all.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that his trials always fail suggests that there is a problem with his approach. Option A is not a plausible answer as liking to do trials does not necessarily mean that they will fail. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that the reason for his failure is due to the lack of a proper method or approach."}}
{"Q": "Yeasts are prokaryotes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Yeast has no chromosomes. (B) They began to find food at night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Yeast has no chromosomes.\nExplanation: This statement is incorrect. Yeasts are actually eukaryotic organisms, meaning they have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, including chromosomes. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer. Option B is also incorrect as it is not related to the classification of yeasts as prokaryotes or eukaryotes."}}
{"Q": "Scientists keep hydrogen peroxide at room temperature. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists need to break down hydrogen peroxide. (B) Scientists need to keep hydrogen peroxide stable.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Scientists need to keep hydrogen peroxide stable.\nExplanation: Hydrogen peroxide can decompose into water and oxygen gas when exposed to heat or light. By keeping it at room temperature, scientists can prevent this decomposition and maintain the stability of the hydrogen peroxide. This is important for experiments or applications where the concentration and properties of the hydrogen peroxide need to be consistent."}}
{"Q": "They walked along the stream. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They found lots of fish in it. (B) They went to ponds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the choices are plausible based on the given information. \nExplanation: The sentence only states that they walked along the stream, and does not provide any information about what happened as a result. Therefore, it is impossible to choose a plausible answer from the given choices."}}
{"Q": "There is grass on alpine steppes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Yaks were fed on alpine steppes. (B) It is big enough to fill one's hand.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Yaks are known to graze on alpine steppes, which are high-altitude grasslands. The presence of grass on these steppes would provide a food source for yaks and other grazing animals that live in the region. Option B, on the other hand, does not make sense in the context of the given statement."}}
{"Q": "People believe its good quality. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This brand is dominant. (B) Tom is good at providing advice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that people believe the product is of good quality suggests that the brand has established a reputation for producing high-quality products. This is likely due to the brand's dominance in the market and consistent delivery of quality products over time. Tom's ability to provide advice may influence individual purchasing decisions, but it is unlikely to be the primary cause of the widespread belief in the brand's quality."}}
{"Q": "The drying time of all paints changed except for latexes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Humidity was decreased. (B) The temperature in summer and winter is more extreme.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The drying time of paints is affected by the humidity in the air. When the humidity is decreased, the paint dries faster. Therefore, it is more plausible that the change in drying time was caused by a decrease in humidity rather than a change in temperature. Latex paints, however, are not affected by humidity as much as other types of paint, which is why their drying time did not change."}}
{"Q": "Patients with cancer always have sudden pain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She becomes despaired. (B) The doctor will give them some meperidine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Not all patients with cancer experience sudden pain, but if they do, the doctor may prescribe pain medication such as meperidine to manage the pain. It is important to address the pain promptly to improve the patient's quality of life and prevent further complications. While a patient may feel despair due to the pain, it is not a guaranteed outcome and should not be assumed as the only result."}}
{"Q": "Nine of them usually have delusions and the other sometimes does. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ten people in the hospital have schizophrenia. (B) The police need keen-eyed hunting dogs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking. It is plausible that ten people in the hospital have schizophrenia, with nine experiencing delusions as a common symptom and one experiencing it less frequently. On the other hand, the statement about police needing hunting dogs is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for the situation described."}}
{"Q": "Tom wants to be refrained from sex. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He write this message down. (B) He became a monk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He became a monk.\nExplanation: Becoming a monk is a common choice for individuals who want to refrain from sex. Monks take vows of celibacy and dedicate their lives to spiritual pursuits, which often involve abstaining from sexual activity. Writing a message down may be a personal choice for Tom, but it is not a likely outcome for someone who wants to refrain from sex."}}
{"Q": "I hide the way of my life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I don't want others know I followed Paganism. (B) My father managed the change of this old bridge for ten years.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the person is hiding the way of their life suggests that it is something that may not be accepted or understood by others. Paganism is often misunderstood and stigmatized, so it is plausible that someone who follows this path may choose to keep it hidden from others. On the other hand, the second option about the bridge does not seem to have any direct connection to the person's personal life and therefore is less likely to be the cause of their secrecy."}}
{"Q": "Fertilization was ready to start. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The gametophyte was formed. (B) The egg was formed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Fertilization can only occur when both male and female gametes are present. The formation of the gametophyte, which produces the gametes, is necessary for fertilization to occur. The formation of the egg alone is not sufficient for fertilization."}}
{"Q": "He soon suffered from obesity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He lays on the sofa and watches TV every day. (B) He eats salad every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence states that he \"soon suffered from obesity,\" indicating that the cause was likely a lack of physical activity and overconsumption of calories. Choice A suggests a sedentary lifestyle, which would contribute to weight gain, while choice B suggests a healthy diet that would not typically lead to obesity."}}
{"Q": "Atoms in oxygen molecules have a greater ability to attract electrons to themselves than nitrogen molecules. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They begin to ingnore causes in any aspect for solutions. (B) Oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen, meaning it has a greater ability to attract electrons towards itself. This results in oxygen molecules having a stronger bond between the atoms than nitrogen molecules."}}
{"Q": "Dogs only have four legs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dogs belong to canids. (B) Now it is mating season.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Dogs only have four legs because they belong to the canid family, which is characterized by having four legs. This is a biological trait that has been passed down through generations of canids, including dogs. Mating season has no relevance to the number of legs a dog has."}}
{"Q": "His gum is inflamed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) All the living cells in his body were not functioning properly. (B) He had the same symptoms.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He had the same symptoms.\nExplanation: Inflammation of the gum is a localized response to injury or infection. It does not affect all the living cells in the body, so option (A) is not a plausible answer. Option (B) is more likely as it suggests that the person may experience pain, swelling, and redness in the affected area, which are common symptoms of gum inflammation."}}
{"Q": "The mitochondrion of the leave has been hurt. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are mildew spots on some leaves. (B) The leave is withered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The mitochondrion is responsible for producing energy in the cell through cellular respiration. If it is damaged, the cell may not be able to produce enough energy to maintain its functions, leading to the withering of the leaf. Mildew spots are more likely to be caused by fungal infections or environmental factors such as humidity and temperature."}}
{"Q": "The manager was greatly irritated by the low salary. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The manager gave him a salary as an award. (B) He had strong response toward the salary.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He had strong response toward the salary.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the manager was greatly irritated by the low salary, which implies that he had a negative reaction towards it. Option (A) does not make sense as it suggests that the manager gave himself a salary as an award, which is unlikely. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "All people in the village died. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Famine happened in the village. (B) The general killed all villagers there.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Famine is a more plausible answer as it is a natural disaster that can cause widespread death in a village. On the other hand, it is highly unlikely that a general would kill all the villagers in a village without any reason or motive."}}
{"Q": "Tom made a lot of short-term investments with the government. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is employed by the government. (B) He made a lot of profits.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Tom made a lot of short-term investments with the government, it is more plausible that he made a lot of profits rather than being employed by the government. Making investments with the government does not necessarily mean that one is employed by the government."}}
{"Q": "The art exhibition was a great success. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Put the surfactant in the solution. (B) A number of artists are invited to the art exhibition.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A number of artists are invited to the art exhibition.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible as the success of an art exhibition is largely dependent on the quality and variety of artwork on display. Inviting a number of talented artists would ensure a diverse range of artwork and attract a larger audience, leading to a successful exhibition. Adding surfactant to a solution may be relevant in a scientific experiment, but it is not relevant to the success of an art exhibition."}}
{"Q": "Toby is very interested in the cliffs of Huashan Mountain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He goes climbing this summer vacation. (B) He found very high topographic relief.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He goes climbing this summer vacation.\nExplanation: Since Toby is very interested in the cliffs of Huashan Mountain, it is more plausible that he would want to experience them firsthand by going climbing rather than simply observing the topographic relief. Climbing would allow him to fully immerse himself in the experience and appreciate the cliffs in a more personal way."}}
{"Q": "Alice got married last year. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She got pregnant last week. (B) They have a little baby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They have a little baby.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alice and her spouse had time to conceive a child and give birth within a year of getting married, rather than getting pregnant just last week. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "His penis bleeds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His penis was pierced by a small wooden stick. (B) He didn't feel the electric current.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His penis was pierced by a small wooden stick.\nExplanation: Bleeding from the penis can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma or injury. Option A suggests that the penis was pierced by a small wooden stick, which could cause bleeding. Option B, on the other hand, is not a likely cause of penile bleeding."}}
{"Q": "Climates are different in the two places. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are so many bettles there. (B) The environments in the two places are also different.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Climates play a significant role in shaping the environment of a place. Different climates lead to different environmental conditions, such as vegetation, soil type, and availability of resources. Therefore, it is more plausible that the environments in the two places are also different due to their distinct climates. The presence of beetles in one place may be due to various factors, such as food availability, habitat suitability, or natural predators, and cannot be solely attributed to climate differences."}}
{"Q": "Balsa is suitable for making a float. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a rotten fruit on the ground. (B) Floats are made of lightweight wood.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Balsa wood is known for its lightweight and buoyant properties, making it an ideal material for making floats. Choice A, about a rotten fruit, is not relevant to the properties of balsa wood."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to the park. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom felt more relaxed than before. (B) Tom got stinged by mosquitoes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom felt more relaxed than before.\nExplanation: Going to the park is often associated with relaxation and being in nature. It is unlikely that the only outcome of Tom going to the park was getting stung by mosquitoes, as this would be a negative experience. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom felt more relaxed than before."}}
{"Q": "Mary is a three-year-old baby. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Many of her peers are suffering from tonsillitis. (B) This kept her from gaining weight easily.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Mary being a three-year-old baby, it is more plausible that her age and developmental stage may have made it difficult for her to gain weight easily, rather than her having an impact on her peers suffering from tonsillitis."}}
{"Q": "The virus became inactive. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He added a lot of Bacillus to the soil. (B) Tom utilized lyophilization to dispose some lethal virus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Lyophilization, also known as freeze-drying, is a process that removes water from a substance by freezing it and then subjecting it to a vacuum. This process can be used to preserve biological materials, including viruses, by removing the water that is necessary for their survival. By utilizing lyophilization to dispose of the lethal virus, Tom likely removed the water from the virus, causing it to become inactive. Adding Bacillus to the soil would not necessarily have any effect on the virus. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There is profound negative effects. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Smoking will inhale nicotine. (B) The population of the area is decreasing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The population of the area is decreasing.\nExplanation: The statement mentions \"profound negative effects\" which is more likely to be caused by a decrease in population rather than smoking. Smoking may have negative effects on health, but it is not likely to cause a profound negative effect on an area as a whole. On the other hand, a decreasing population can have a significant impact on the economy, social structure, and overall well-being of an area."}}
{"Q": "It began to grow tusks. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mother elephant in the zoo gave birth. (B) The female elephant in the zoo is getting old.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The female elephant in the zoo is getting old.\nExplanation: As elephants age, they may develop tusks. This is a natural process and is more likely than a mother elephant giving birth to a calf with tusks."}}
{"Q": "The frail Maria coughs for a long time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He suffered from long scars. (B) Her lungs are obviously inflamed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Her lungs are obviously inflamed.\nExplanation: The fact that Maria coughs for a long time suggests that there is an issue with her respiratory system. Inflammation of the lungs is a common cause of persistent coughing, and it is a more plausible answer than suffering from long scars, which is not directly related to coughing."}}
{"Q": "He dug up a snapdragon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found it had shallow root. (B) He discovered that it could blossom and bear fruit on its own.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He found it had shallow root.\nExplanation: Snapdragons are known to have shallow roots, so it is more plausible that the person digging it up would discover this fact rather than the plant suddenly being able to blossom and bear fruit on its own."}}
{"Q": "The researchers conducted cloning experiments. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researcher observed that the drones mated with the queen. (B) Some people were responsible for producing genetic copies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Some people were responsible for producing genetic copies.\nExplanation: The sentence only mentions that the researchers conducted cloning experiments, but it does not provide any information about the outcome of those experiments. Therefore, option A cannot be the correct answer. Option B, on the other hand, is a more plausible answer as it suggests that the researchers were able to produce genetic copies through their cloning experiments."}}
{"Q": "What he follows is not real libertarianism. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom follows ducks. (B) My father only wants individual liberty but not individual responsibility.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) My father only wants individual liberty but not individual responsibility.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly addresses the statement that \"what he follows is not real libertarianism.\" Libertarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual liberty and responsibility, so if someone only wants one aspect of it, they are not truly following the philosophy. The statement about Tom following ducks is unrelated and does not provide a logical explanation for the situation."}}
{"Q": "A cell line is differentiated. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is different from other cell lines now. (B) The nuclear of the cell hasn't been divided.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It is different from other cell lines now.\nExplanation: Differentiation refers to the process by which a cell becomes specialized to perform a specific function. As a result of differentiation, the cell line will have different characteristics and functions compared to other cell lines. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Option B is incorrect because the division of the nucleus is not related to differentiation."}}
{"Q": "The tumble caused his dehiscence. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a change in his vision. (B) The previously joined wound separated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The previously joined wound separated.\nExplanation: Dehiscence refers to the separation of previously joined tissues or wound edges. Therefore, it is more plausible that the tumble caused the wound to separate rather than causing a change in vision."}}
{"Q": "He bought a big mat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He applied a design for specific use. (B) He used it to cover the floor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He used it to cover the floor.\nExplanation: It is more likely that someone would buy a big mat to use it as a floor covering rather than applying a design for specific use. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jerry was in need of a design for his company's logo. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jerry turned to an enterprises and paid to get a good design. (B) He puts all the needed elements into the advertisement.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Jerry turned to an enterprise and paid to get a good design. This is the most plausible answer as it is common for companies to seek professional help in designing their logos. It ensures that the logo is unique, visually appealing, and represents the company's values and goals. Putting all the needed elements into the advertisement may not necessarily result in a good logo design."}}
{"Q": "Their prey can escape the catastrophe at this time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Loggerheads atre abundant in the sea. (B) Some animals hibernate in winter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Some animals hibernate in winter, which means they go into a state of deep sleep and reduce their metabolic rate to conserve energy. This allows them to survive through the winter without needing to hunt or forage for food. Therefore, their prey may have escaped the catastrophe by hibernating during the time of the event. On the other hand, choice A about loggerheads being abundant in the sea does not provide a clear explanation for how their prey could have escaped the catastrophe."}}
{"Q": "I bought fruit for it. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had a margay. (B) Air and moisture are essential for plants to grow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement \"Air and moisture are essential for plants to grow\" is a more plausible cause for buying fruit as fruits are a product of plants. The presence of a margay (a type of wild cat) does not seem to have any direct connection to buying fruit."}}
{"Q": "He wanted some paraffin. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He created a substitution reaction. (B) He was looking for paraffin in the trash.", "R": {"text": "Answer: He obtained paraffin.\nExplanation: The sentence simply states that he wanted paraffin, which implies that he obtained it. There is no information to suggest that he created a substitution reaction or was looking for paraffin in the trash."}}
{"Q": "The summary of Tom's paper had a mistake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He asked Emily to help decide. (B) Professors picked the mistake up immediately.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that professors picked up the mistake immediately as they are experts in the field and have experience in reading and evaluating academic papers. It is unlikely that Tom would ask Emily to help decide on a mistake in his paper summary, as she may not have the necessary expertise to identify the error."}}
{"Q": "The altimeter malfunctions and fails to measurie atmospheric pressure. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He grows taller than other classmates. (B) The plane's altitude cannot be determined.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The plane's altitude cannot be determined.\nExplanation: An altimeter measures the atmospheric pressure to determine the altitude of an object. If it malfunctions and fails to measure atmospheric pressure, it will not be able to accurately determine the altitude of the plane. This can be dangerous as the pilot needs to know the altitude to avoid collisions with other planes and obstacles on the ground. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer. Option (A) is not related to the malfunction of an altimeter."}}
{"Q": "Steven yearns for the results of the college entrance examination. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She observed them carefully. (B) Naturally, Steven is always in a state of anxiety.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The sentence implies that Steven is anxious about the results of the college entrance examination. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer as it reflects Steven's state of mind. Option A does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Silk has different variations. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The high temperature is changing the solid to liquid. (B) Tom put sweat, tears and saliva on the silk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The different variations of silk are caused by the different types of silkworms and their diets, as well as the different methods of processing the silk fibers. Tom putting sweat, tears, and saliva on the silk would not cause variations in the silk."}}
{"Q": "He thought he can fly even when awake. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike became a superman in the film. (B) Mike became a superman in his dreams.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Mike became a superman in his dreams.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mike's belief that he can fly was a result of his dream rather than becoming a superman in a film. Dreams can often feel very real and can influence our thoughts and beliefs even when we are awake. It is not uncommon for people to have vivid dreams of flying or having superpowers, which can sometimes carry over into their waking thoughts and behaviors."}}
{"Q": "The fly was eaten by the spider. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The gardener was asked to kill the insects in the garden. (B) A fly was capture by a spider.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the fly was captured by the spider, as this is a natural occurrence in the food chain. Choice A, about the gardener killing insects, is not directly related to the fly being eaten by the spider."}}
{"Q": "Now we are tourists. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The success of reproducing flowers he dreamed of was influenced. (B) We start our trips.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The statement \"Now we are tourists\" implies that the speaker and/or the group they are referring to have started their travels as tourists. This has no direct correlation with the success of reproducing flowers, making option B the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "There is a bee on the periwinkle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The periwinkle has no reaction. (B) The periwinkle attracts a lot of butterflies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The periwinkle has no reaction.\nExplanation: Periwinkles are not known to have any specific reaction to bees. While bees may pollinate the periwinkle, they do not necessarily attract butterflies. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The amateur observed the shape of moon via images from satellites. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A kind of Emulsion was produced. (B) Its shape ranges from highly irregular to sphere.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The observation of the moon's shape via images from satellites revealed that its shape ranges from highly irregular to sphere. There is no mention of any emulsion being produced as a result of this observation."}}
{"Q": "His father told him it was just a manifestation of volcanic activity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John is shocked by the unusual shape of this creature. (B) The villager was terrified of the geysers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Volcanic activity.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the father told him that the cause of something was a manifestation of volcanic activity. This means that the cause of whatever is being referred to is related to volcanic activity, not John's shock or the villager's fear of geysers."}}
{"Q": "Parents are more traditional than children. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Parents have diffrent styles from children. (B) The boy's mother bought spinach for him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement suggests that parents and children have different beliefs and values, with parents being more traditional. This could result in differences in parenting styles, decision-making, and overall behavior. The example given in choice B is not related to the statement and seems random."}}
{"Q": "Tom mixex some reactants together in a beaker to see what will happen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The beaker becomes too hot and breaks into pieces. (B) The boy was naturalized into the Smith family.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that mixing certain reactants together could cause a chemical reaction that produces heat, potentially causing the beaker to become too hot and break. Option B is completely unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "Too many calories do a lot of harm to human body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It's the side effect after having narcotics. (B) The current trend is to restrict calorie intake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement suggests that consuming too many calories can harm the human body, which is a well-known fact in the field of nutrition and health. Therefore, it is more plausible that the current trend is to restrict calorie intake rather than it being a side effect of narcotics."}}
{"Q": "She doesn't believe for her unffected visual acuity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My grandma was diagnoised as cataract. (B) Lucy always bought something unnecessary.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the speaker's grandmother was diagnosed with cataract suggests that visual impairment runs in the family and could be a possible cause for the speaker's disbelief in her unaffected visual acuity. Choice B, which talks about Lucy buying unnecessary things, is not related to the topic and is an irrelevant option."}}
{"Q": "She will be relieved. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Maria listens to music when she is in a bad mood. (B) On December 16, 1902, the eruption of Mount Peree in the West Indies shook the world.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Maria listens to music when she is in a bad mood.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Maria's emotional state and suggests that listening to music has a positive effect on her mood. The eruption of Mount Peree, on the other hand, is an unrelated event that would not likely have any impact on Maria's emotional state."}}
{"Q": "He melted some ice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to made some cider. (B) Tom forgot to bring water to do the experiment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom forgot to bring water to do the experiment, so he melted some ice as a substitute. This is a common solution when someone needs water but doesn't have any readily available. Making cider is not related to melting ice, so option A is less likely to be the cause."}}
{"Q": "Tom took a lot of antibiotics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Now he is immune to chickenpox. (B) The doctor prescribed him a lot of probiotics to keep him healthy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The doctor prescribed him a lot of probiotics to keep him healthy.\nExplanation: Taking a lot of antibiotics can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the gut, leading to digestive issues and a weakened immune system. To counteract this, doctors often prescribe probiotics to help restore the balance of good bacteria in the gut and support overall health. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as antibiotics do not provide immunity to chickenpox."}}
{"Q": "Her parents invites her to take a trip together. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sharry was busy with her study recently and she felt tired. (B) Brown wants to buy some anti-gallng binder.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Sharry has been busy with her studies and feels tired suggests that her parents may have noticed this and want to offer her a break by taking a trip together. Option B, which mentions Brown wanting to buy an anti-galling binder, is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for why Sharry's parents would invite her on a trip."}}
{"Q": "Cats eat mice. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cats are dead. (B) They have kept an ecological balance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: They have kept an ecological balance.\nExplanation: Cats are natural predators of mice and play an important role in controlling their population. By eating mice, cats help to maintain a balance in the ecosystem. If there were no cats to control the mouse population, it could lead to an overpopulation of mice, which could have negative effects on the environment and other species. Therefore, it is more plausible to say that cats have kept an ecological balance by eating mice."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have detected toxic substances. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists test soldiers' excrement. (B) A chemist examined the chemicals contained in marijuana.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Scientists test soldiers' excrement.\nExplanation: It is more likely that scientists detected toxic substances in soldiers' excrement due to exposure to harmful chemicals or substances during their military duties or training. Testing marijuana chemicals would not necessarily lead to the detection of toxic substances."}}
{"Q": "She got tired of announcing similar result involving prizes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The hostess joined in so many host contests. (B) The hostess hosted so many different contests.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the hostess hosted so many different contests, then it is likely that she had to announce similar results involving prizes multiple times. This could have become repetitive and boring for her, leading to her getting tired of it. On the other hand, if she had only joined in a few host contests, it would not necessarily result in her having to announce similar results repeatedly. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jackson's father is going to build a house. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jackson's uncle brought in the machines. (B) He bought much wood.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He bought much wood.\nExplanation: If Jackson's father is going to build a house, it is more plausible that he would need to purchase a significant amount of wood for the construction. Jackson's uncle bringing in machines may be helpful, but it is not necessarily a direct result of Jackson's father building a house."}}
{"Q": "He heated the water to almost 100 degrees when he saw the vapour. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John wants to see the water vapour. (B) Tom's experiment produced some methanol gas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence states that he heated the water to almost 100 degrees \"when he saw the vapour,\" indicating that the appearance of the vapor was unexpected and not intentionally caused. Choice A, that John wanted to see the water vapor, is a more plausible explanation than choice B, which introduces a new element (methanol gas) that is not mentioned in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "They had an accident in their Jeep. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The windows were broken but they were safe. (B) The oil splashed wet people nearby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The windows were broken but they were safe.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is common for windows to break during a car accident, but it is unlikely for oil to splash on people nearby unless there was a separate issue with the Jeep's engine or oil system. Additionally, the fact that the people in the Jeep were safe suggests that the accident was not severe enough to cause oil to splash out."}}
{"Q": "Woody deciduous plants become bold and brown in late autumn. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Grapevines become bold and brown in late autumn. (B) Gardeners will prevent this plant from growing in gardens.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement mentions \"woody deciduous plants\" becoming \"bold and brown in late autumn.\" This description fits the typical behavior of grapevines, which lose their leaves and turn brown in the fall. Therefore, it is more plausible that grapevines become bold and brown in late autumn rather than gardeners preventing this plant from growing in gardens."}}
{"Q": "Soon it froze to death. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He threw some apple cores in his garden. (B) They put the monarchs in the refrigerator.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the monarchs freezing to death was most likely due to them being put in the refrigerator. Monarchs are cold-blooded insects and cannot survive in cold temperatures. Putting them in the refrigerator would have caused them to become too cold and ultimately lead to their death. Throwing apple cores in the garden would not have directly caused the monarchs to freeze to death."}}
{"Q": "His mother bought some foxgloves home. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted some flowers to decorate his bedroom. (B) Tom wants a house where he can dry his clothes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tom wanted some flowers to decorate his bedroom.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom's mother bought foxgloves suggests that she bought them as flowers for decoration. Option B, about Tom wanting a house to dry his clothes, is unrelated to the situation and does not provide a plausible explanation for why his mother bought foxgloves."}}
{"Q": "Tom and Lucy divorced. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Children were adjudged to be adopted by their mother. (B) Resonance occurred.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: In a divorce, the court typically decides on custody arrangements for any children involved. It is common for the mother to be awarded custody, and in some cases, the children may be legally adopted by the mother. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B, resonance, is not related to divorce and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Her parents invites her to take a trip together. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Farmers want to improve the ablity of legume crops to fix their own nitrogen. (B) Sharry was busy with her study recently and she felt tired.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of her parents inviting her to take a trip together is that Sharry has been busy with her studies and feels tired. Option A is unrelated and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "They structured a healthy ecosystem. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) All creatures in nature are in balance. (B) Kelps have a strong ability of adaptation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that a healthy ecosystem was structured, which implies that all creatures in nature are in balance. This is a fundamental principle of ecology, where each organism plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, only mentions the ability of kelps to adapt, which may contribute to the ecosystem's health but is not the sole cause of it."}}
{"Q": "I saw many triggerfish in underwater wolrd in Maldives. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy was scared. (B) They have very beautiful colors.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the person saw many triggerfish in underwater world in Maldives. Therefore, it is more plausible that the observation led to the realization that triggerfish have very beautiful colors, rather than Lucy being scared (which is not mentioned or implied in the statement)."}}
{"Q": "He always does researches about mental activities of human beings. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientist wants to research human. (B) Tom is a student who was majoring in psychology.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom is majoring in psychology suggests that he has a specific interest in mental activities of human beings, which is why he conducts research on the topic. It is more plausible than assuming he is a scientist who randomly chose this area of study."}}
{"Q": "His skin is very dry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He used body moisture and got better. (B) The doctor diagnosed him with mumps.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He used body moisture and got better.\nExplanation: Dry skin is a common condition that can be treated with moisturizers or body lotions. It is unlikely that dry skin would result in a diagnosis of mumps, which is a viral infection that causes swelling of the salivary glands. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer as it suggests a simple solution to the problem of dry skin."}}
{"Q": "People have two faces towards family and others. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is no quarrel at home. (B) The feeling of drowsiness often occurs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There is no quarrel at home.\nExplanation: When people have two faces towards family and others, they tend to behave differently in different situations. However, when they are with their family, they tend to be more comfortable and open, which leads to fewer misunderstandings and quarrels. Therefore, it is more plausible that there is no quarrel at home when people have two faces towards family and others."}}
{"Q": "The director asked the staff about the product knowledge. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The staff took use of codes instead of spoken words. (B) The staff was able to answer them all.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The staff was able to answer them all.\nExplanation: Since the director asked about product knowledge, it is likely that the staff had to demonstrate their knowledge by answering questions. Therefore, it is plausible that the staff was able to answer all the questions asked by the director. Option A, on the other hand, seems unrelated to the situation and does not make sense as a result of the director's question."}}
{"Q": "He was afriad of the appearance of mice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The gardener kept a cat on this land. (B) The gardener sowed grass seed on this land.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The presence of a cat on the land would be a plausible reason for someone to be afraid of mice, as cats are natural predators of mice and their presence would likely deter mice from appearing. Sowing grass seed on the land would not have any direct correlation to the appearance of mice."}}
{"Q": "The teacher played games with him and other children. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was sent to the kindergarten. (B) Geography teacher uses a globe to teach students about geography.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"kindergarten\" which implies that the teacher is likely a kindergarten teacher. Playing games is a common activity in kindergarten classrooms as it helps children learn and develop social skills. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the teacher playing games with the children is because Tom was sent to the kindergarten. Option B, about a geography teacher using a globe, is not related to the sentence and is therefore an unlikely answer."}}
{"Q": "Blood brings oxygen to thw body in this way. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Blood runs through the body via vessels. (B) Tom attach too much importance to his shoes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Blood brings oxygen to the body through vessels, specifically the arteries and capillaries. These vessels transport oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the rest of the body, where it is used by cells for energy. Without these vessels, oxygen would not be able to reach all parts of the body efficiently. Choice B is irrelevant and does not provide a plausible explanation for how blood brings oxygen to the body."}}
{"Q": "The car doesn't work any more. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Close the S pole of magnet A to the N pole of magnet B. (B) The metal on the gearbox is oxidized.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The metal on the gearbox being oxidized is a more plausible cause for the car not working anymore as it is a common issue that can occur over time due to exposure to moisture and air. Closing the S pole of magnet A to the N pole of magnet B is not a likely cause for a car to stop working."}}
{"Q": "He was blamed for insult the religious paintings. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom accidentally touched the clay sculpture. (B) He urinated beside the icons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Urinating beside religious icons is a highly disrespectful act and would be considered insulting to the religious paintings. Accidentally touching a clay sculpture, while potentially damaging, would not necessarily be seen as insulting in the same way. Therefore, option B is the more plausible cause for the blame."}}
{"Q": "They helped kill bacteria they have engulfed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack planted beets in the cool outdoors and in the warm greenhouse. (B) The Phagocytes utilized oxidants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement is referring to phagocytes, which are cells in the immune system that engulf and destroy bacteria. One of the ways they do this is by utilizing oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide, to kill the bacteria. Choice A, about planting beets, is not relevant to the statement."}}
{"Q": "The tardigrades began to curled themselves up into a little ball called a tun. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The dry season is here. (B) It's been windy lately.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The dry season is here.\nExplanation: Tardigrades are known for their ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation (drying out). When faced with a lack of water, tardigrades will enter a state of suspended animation called a tun, where they curl up into a ball and reduce their metabolic activity to almost zero. This allows them to survive for extended periods of time without water, until conditions become more favorable for them to resume their normal activities. Therefore, the most plausible answer for why the tardigrades are curling up into a tun is that the dry season has arrived and they are preparing to survive without water."}}
{"Q": "They live in wilderness regions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Those men are hikers. (B) This kind of animal mainly preys on Scavengers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the reason for people living in wilderness regions is related to the presence of a certain type of animal that preys on scavengers. This implies that the region may not be suitable for other types of settlement or agriculture, making it more plausible that people living there are doing so out of necessity rather than choice. Option A, which suggests that the people are hikers, does not provide a convincing explanation for why they would choose to live in such a remote and potentially dangerous area."}}
{"Q": "His elphant is watching a bird that is really far. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The elephant can't see it clear. (B) The elephant wants to eat it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The elephant can't see it clear.\nExplanation: Since the bird is really far, it is unlikely that the elephant would want to eat it. However, it is plausible that the elephant may not be able to see the bird clearly due to the distance."}}
{"Q": "They live well. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The sunlight is there for the pineapples everyday. (B) Antelopes often migrate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The sunlight is there for the pineapples everyday.\nExplanation: The statement \"They live well\" is not specific about who or what is being referred to. However, the first option mentions pineapples and their access to sunlight, which is a known requirement for their growth and well-being. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of their well-being is the consistent presence of sunlight. The second option about antelopes migrating is not directly related to the statement and does not provide a clear explanation for their well-being."}}
{"Q": "There are much more creatures in the sea than on land. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Brachiopods occupy a large part of marine creatures. (B) It needs a lot of people to explore it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Brachiopods are a type of marine creature that have been around for millions of years and occupy a large part of the ocean's biodiversity. This is likely due to the fact that the ocean provides a more stable environment for these creatures to thrive in, as well as the fact that there are fewer predators in the ocean compared to on land. Therefore, it is more plausible that the abundance of marine creatures has led to the dominance of certain species, such as brachiopods, rather than the need for more people to explore it."}}
{"Q": "Linda is good at typing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She can not find a job. (B) She is hired by a potent company for her potential to make interest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Linda's skill in typing makes her a valuable asset to companies that require a lot of typing, such as data entry or transcription. Therefore, it is more plausible that she would be hired by a company for her typing skills rather than being unable to find a job."}}
{"Q": "There are many little frogs in the pond. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The number of weeds in the pond grew greatly. (B) Tom put some frog eggs in the pond at home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the little frogs in the pond were the result of someone intentionally introducing frog eggs into the pond, rather than the number of weeds in the pond suddenly increasing and providing a suitable habitat for the frogs to breed."}}
{"Q": "Blair's answer is narration. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher asked what is the translation from printed matter to spoken language. (B) This passage discusses the structure of dominant genes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The question is asking for the cause of Blair's answer being narration. Choice A states that the teacher asked a question about the translation from printed matter to spoken language, which is likely to prompt a response that involves narration. Choice B is unrelated to the question and does not provide a plausible explanation for Blair's answer. Therefore, choice A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He had to make instruments. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wants to control noise. (B) Jerry was making a plane.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The given information does not provide any context or reason for why the person had to make instruments. However, the second choice provides a plausible reason that the person may have been making instruments to assist Jerry in making a plane. Therefore, option B is a more logical answer."}}
{"Q": "Logan lacks red blood cells in his body. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Doctors inject some erythropoietin into his bone marrow. (B) He developed acute hemolytic anemia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Logan lacks red blood cells in his body, it is likely that he has a condition called anemia. One of the treatments for anemia is to inject erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells, into the bone marrow. This would help increase the number of red blood cells in Logan's body and alleviate his symptoms. Option B, acute hemolytic anemia, is not a likely result of Logan's condition as it is a type of anemia caused by the destruction of red blood cells, rather than a lack of production."}}
{"Q": "Mary was pregnant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary suffered from heartburn. (B) The doctor said that she can begin her normal delivery because of the diameter of her cervix has reached the standard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The doctor said that she can begin her normal delivery because of the diameter of her cervix has reached the standard.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Mary's pregnancy and the progress of her delivery. Heartburn may be a common symptom during pregnancy, but it does not necessarily have a direct impact on the delivery process. On the other hand, the diameter of the cervix is a crucial factor in determining when a woman can begin her delivery. Therefore, it is more likely that the doctor would make a decision based on this factor."}}
{"Q": "This polite sentence instantly turned into a curse. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The class was broken by a call of the teacher. (B) Tom added a modal particle to the sentence.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom added a modal particle to the sentence.\nExplanation: Modal particles are words that are added to a sentence to convey a speaker's attitude or mood. In some languages, including Chinese and German, these particles can drastically change the meaning of a sentence. For example, in Chinese, adding the particle \"ma\" to the end of a sentence turns it into a question. Similarly, in German, adding the particle \"doch\" can turn a negative statement into a positive one. In this case, adding a curse word as a modal particle to a polite sentence can instantly change its meaning and tone. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's addition of a curse word caused the sentence to turn into a curse."}}
{"Q": "Tom suffered convulsions. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has an electrical malfunction of the brain. (B) His intestinal peristalsis was inhibited, affecting the digestive system.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom has an electrical malfunction of the brain.\nExplanation: Convulsions are a symptom of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can cause involuntary muscle contractions and spasms. This suggests that Tom's convulsions were likely caused by an electrical malfunction in his brain, rather than an inhibition of intestinal peristalsis affecting his digestive system."}}
{"Q": "Lily has a sudden cardiac arrest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Some regions in her brain can’t be connected with other regions. (B) Lily died of cerebral ischemia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Some regions in her brain can't be connected with other regions.\nExplanation: Sudden cardiac arrest can cause a lack of oxygen supply to the brain, which can result in damage to certain regions of the brain. This damage can lead to a disruption in the connections between different regions of the brain, affecting cognitive and motor functions. However, cerebral ischemia, which is a lack of blood flow to the brain, can lead to brain damage and death, but it is not necessarily the immediate result of a sudden cardiac arrest."}}
{"Q": "Tom put the maggots in ice water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They're all dead. (B) She put some vegetables into it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They're all dead.\nExplanation: Maggots are cold-blooded creatures and cannot regulate their body temperature. When they are exposed to extreme cold, such as ice water, their metabolic processes slow down and eventually stop, leading to their death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the maggots died as a result of being put in ice water. Choice B, which mentions vegetables, is not relevant to the situation and does not provide a logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "He ate broccolis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John wanted to take in extra nutrients. (B) The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that John intentionally ate broccolis, which is likely due to his desire to take in extra nutrients. Option B is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for John's behavior."}}
{"Q": "He is very knowledgeable. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom likes reading books. (B) Jack is a physician.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom likes reading books.\nExplanation: It is more likely that someone who is knowledgeable has gained their knowledge through reading and learning, rather than simply having a certain profession like being a physician. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The number of workers on the square being employed is more than the number of those in the company. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They kept a a flock of sheep. (B) There are more workers on the square than in the company.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There are more workers on the square than in the company.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly addresses the statement given in the question. It suggests that the square has more workers than the company, which could be due to various reasons such as outsourcing work, hiring temporary workers, or having a larger workforce for specific tasks on the square. Option (A) about keeping a flock of sheep is not related to the given statement and seems like an irrelevant distraction."}}
{"Q": "They will take actions for contraception. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy and Tom are not ready for the coming of a baby. (B) Scientists admit that females suffer from sexual reproduction.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lucy and Tom are not ready for the coming of a baby.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the actions being taken for contraception. It suggests that Lucy and Tom are actively trying to prevent pregnancy because they are not prepared to have a baby at this time. Option B, on the other hand, is not a likely cause for this specific situation as it is a general statement about the potential drawbacks of sexual reproduction and does not provide a specific reason for Lucy and Tom's actions."}}
{"Q": "They are having a lunch break. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's mother bought some lemons for Tom to eat. (B) It is about 3锛00pm now.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that they are having a lunch break suggests that it is midday, so option B is the most plausible answer as it indicates that some time has passed since the start of the day. Option A is not related to the given information and seems unlikely."}}
{"Q": "He is allergic to dust. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom suffers from asthma. (B) The soldier is afraid of explosions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom suffers from asthma.\nExplanation: Asthma is a respiratory condition that can be triggered by various factors, including dust. Allergies to dust are common among people with asthma, and exposure to dust can cause wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's allergy to dust is related to his asthma rather than being afraid of explosions, which is unrelated to respiratory issues."}}
{"Q": "I observed  the natural ends the tips of a linear chromosome through the microscope. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ions are the same as atoms. (B) After looking at the data, I learned that it is called telomere.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The observation of the natural ends of a linear chromosome through a microscope would reveal the presence of telomeres, which are specialized structures that protect the ends of chromosomes from degradation and fusion with other chromosomes. Choice A, stating that ions are the same as atoms, is unrelated to the observation of chromosome ends and therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He's under arrest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The thief sneaked into the house on a dark night. (B) He has embezzled money from the public fund.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement \"He's under arrest\" suggests that the person has committed a crime. Option B, which states that he has embezzled money from the public fund, is a more plausible reason for his arrest than option A, which talks about a thief sneaking into a house on a dark night. Embezzlement is a serious crime that can lead to arrest, while sneaking into a house may not necessarily result in an arrest."}}
{"Q": "Andy saw a hellbound in my house yesterday. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It must be her imagination. (B) I went downstairs to find that there was indeed a fight going on.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: If Andy saw a hellhound in the house, it is unlikely to be her imagination. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that there was indeed a fight going on in the house."}}
{"Q": "Some people does not believe intuition. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Moving from places is like migration. (B) Intuition cannot be tested yet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Some people do not believe in intuition because it cannot be tested or proven scientifically. Intuition is often seen as a subjective and unreliable source of information, which makes it difficult for some people to trust or rely on it. Additionally, intuition can sometimes conflict with logic or reason, which can further undermine its credibility in the eyes of skeptics."}}
{"Q": "There is no water in the soil. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The farmer has put a pond liner on the road. (B) The man poured too much nutrient solution into the pond.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The farmer has put a pond liner on the road.\nExplanation: If the farmer has put a pond liner on the road, it means that the water cannot seep into the soil, which could lead to a lack of water in the soil. On the other hand, pouring too much nutrient solution into the pond would not affect the water content in the soil."}}
{"Q": "The sick people were biten. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The dog brought fleas to the ward. (B) Megakaryocytes pinched off small cell fragments.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The dog brought fleas to the ward.\nExplanation: Fleas are known to carry and transmit diseases to humans and animals through their bites. If the sick people were bitten, it is possible that the dog brought fleas into the ward, which then bit the patients. Megakaryocytes pinching off small cell fragments is a process that occurs in the bone marrow and is not related to the scenario described in the question. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The workers are required to protect topsoil from wind erosion. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They built a dam. (B) They planted rows of trees as shelterbelts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Planting rows of trees as shelterbelts is a common method used to protect topsoil from wind erosion. The trees act as a barrier, reducing wind speed and preventing soil from being blown away. Building a dam would not be an effective method for protecting topsoil from wind erosion."}}
{"Q": "Scientists named it tolerance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researchers found a special kind of aquatic plant in the lake water sample. (B) Scientists are studying the state of unresponsiveness to a specific known antigen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The term \"tolerance\" is commonly used in immunology to refer to the state of unresponsiveness to a specific known antigen. This suggests that the scientists in question were likely studying the immune system and its response to antigens. Choice A, which involves the discovery of a plant in a lake water sample, does not seem to be related to the concept of tolerance in immunology."}}
{"Q": "Researchers found a primate that ate leaves in the forest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They are called langurs in the literature. (B) It became a human.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They are called langurs in the literature.\nExplanation: The statement suggests that researchers discovered a new primate species that feeds on leaves in the forest. Therefore, it is more plausible that the researchers named the primate and identified it as a langur, which is a known species of leaf-eating primates, rather than the primate transforming into a human."}}
{"Q": "He shouldn't have contact with electricity to avoid electric shock. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has insulator on his fingers. (B) He has rainwater on his fingers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Rainwater is a good conductor of electricity, so if someone has rainwater on their fingers and comes into contact with electricity, they are at risk of electric shock. Insulators, on the other hand, prevent the flow of electricity and would actually protect someone from electric shock. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The hunter intended to make the warble uglier. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He plucked all its plumages. (B) He went to mangrove areas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He plucked all its plumages.\nExplanation: Plucking all the plumages of a bird would definitely make it look uglier. On the other hand, going to mangrove areas would not necessarily make the warble uglier. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Einstein accumulated experience in barriers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He eventually succeeded in becoming a great inventor. (B) Tom walked safely over the wires.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He eventually succeeded in becoming a great inventor.\nExplanation: Einstein's experience in facing barriers and overcoming them likely helped him develop perseverance, problem-solving skills, and creativity, which are all important qualities for inventors. Additionally, his work in physics and development of the theory of relativity had a significant impact on modern technology and scientific understanding."}}
{"Q": "The flakes fell on the back of penguins. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The capes protected them from getting wet. (B) They shook their backs off the flakes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They shook their backs off the flakes.\nExplanation: Penguins have a special oil on their feathers that helps repel water, so the flakes would not have made them wet. However, penguins are known to shake their bodies to remove any debris or snow that may have accumulated on their feathers. Therefore, it is more likely that they would shake off the flakes rather than rely on their capes to protect them."}}
{"Q": "This book introduces changes in the state of something. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This is a book about dynamics. (B) This book is about physics.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. This is a book about dynamics.\nExplanation: Dynamics is the study of how things change over time, including changes in the state of something. Therefore, it is more plausible that this book is about dynamics rather than just physics, which is a broader field that encompasses many different topics."}}
{"Q": "One of Tom's ramjet needs energy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom added some paraffin oil to the ramjet. (B) He listened to music in it for the whole day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom added some paraffin oil to the ramjet.\nExplanation: Adding paraffin oil to a ramjet is a plausible solution to provide energy as it can act as a fuel for the engine. Listening to music in the ramjet would not provide any energy to the engine and is not a logical solution."}}
{"Q": "The Chinese commander said that thanks to the right strategy,. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Chinese army showed super capacity in the war and won a great victory. (B) He ate a whole cantaloupe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The Chinese commander's statement suggests that the right strategy was the reason for their success in the war, indicating that the Chinese army showed super capacity and won a great victory. Option B, which suggests that the commander's success was due to eating a cantaloupe, is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The one-year-old Tom's teeth began to stick out of his gums. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom's mother said he was teething. (B) When the roots of the baby teeth is deep, people pull them out on their own.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom's mother said he was teething.\nExplanation: When a baby's teeth begin to stick out of their gums, it is a sign that they are teething. This is a natural process that occurs as the baby's teeth begin to emerge. Option B, about pulling out baby teeth with deep roots, is not relevant to the situation described in the question."}}
{"Q": "He was bited a lot by mosquitoes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John has experienced field survival. (B) Jack is not feeling well.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that he was bitten a lot by mosquitoes suggests that he was in an environment where mosquitoes are prevalent, such as in the outdoors or in a tropical climate. Option A, which suggests that John has experienced field survival, is a more plausible answer as it implies that he was in an environment where mosquitoes are common. Option B, which suggests that Jack is not feeling well, does not provide a clear explanation for why he was bitten by mosquitoes."}}
{"Q": "The trees almost all died. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Farmers planted some trees in the zone. (B) There is a big tamarisk tree growing in the forests.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Farmers planted some trees in the zone.\nExplanation: The presence of farmers planting trees in the area suggests that they may have used pesticides or other chemicals that could have harmed the trees. Additionally, the farmers may have disrupted the natural ecosystem of the area, leading to the death of the trees. On the other hand, the presence of a single tamarisk tree would not likely cause the death of almost all the trees in the forest."}}
{"Q": "Penicillin is now outdated because our excess use of it. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Researchers produced Penicillinases to deal with this problem. (B) The scientists have invented replacements.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Due to the overuse of penicillin, bacteria have developed resistance to it, making it less effective in treating infections. As a result, scientists have been working on developing new antibiotics to replace penicillin and combat antibiotic resistance. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is incorrect because penicillinases are enzymes produced by bacteria to break down penicillin, and they are not a solution to the problem of antibiotic resistance."}}
{"Q": "The baby is growing up. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He feeds all kinds of animals three meals a day. (B) He can't wear his former clothes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He can't wear his former clothes.\nExplanation: As the baby grows up, he will naturally outgrow his clothes and will need new ones that fit him better. This is a common occurrence as children grow and develop. Feeding animals three meals a day (choice A) is not necessarily related to the baby growing up and is not a likely result of this situation."}}
{"Q": "Wang was infected by the bacteria. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Wang breathed small droplets of water contaminated by the bacteria. (B) Wang breathed small droplets of water purified for the bacteria.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Wang was infected by the bacteria, which means that the bacteria entered his body and caused an infection. Breathing in small droplets of water contaminated by the bacteria is a common way for bacterial infections to occur. On the other hand, breathing in small droplets of water purified for the bacteria would not lead to an infection, as the bacteria would have been removed from the water. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "These years he had accumulated abundant experience. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He became experienced. (B) He had evolution more quickly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He became experienced.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that he had accumulated abundant experience over the years. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that he became experienced as a result of this accumulation of experience. Option B, on the other hand, does not make sense in this context as evolution refers to the gradual development of something over time, which does not fit with the idea of accumulating experience."}}
{"Q": "Tom is making steamed buns. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He likes eating steamed buns. (B) He put some amines in the bowl.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He likes eating steamed buns.\nExplanation: The given information only states that Tom is making steamed buns. There is no indication or reason to believe that he put amines in the bowl. However, it is reasonable to assume that he likes eating steamed buns since he is making them."}}
{"Q": "The potatoes he grew had russet disease and were therefore inedible. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Streptomyces scabies found in soil where John grew potatoes. (B) Mr. Wang, 30, wants to choose an investment method to prepare for retirement.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Streptomyces scabies found in soil where John grew potatoes.\nExplanation: Russet disease is caused by a bacterium called Streptomyces scabies, which is commonly found in soil. This bacterium infects the potato plant and causes scab-like lesions on the skin of the potato, making it inedible. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer for the cause of the inedible potatoes. Option B is irrelevant and has no connection with the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "It flies to a plant stem. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The kestrel wants to find a leaf as a lookout. (B) The Sawfly is to lay eggs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the Sawfly is laying eggs on the plant stem. Many species of Sawflies lay their eggs on plant stems or leaves, as this provides a suitable environment for their larvae to feed and develop. The kestrel wanting to find a leaf as a lookout is not a likely explanation for flying to a plant stem."}}
{"Q": "He felt noticeably more relaxed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The professor listened to the whole demonstration. (B) Tom listens to music when he is tired of studying.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The professor listened to the whole demonstration.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person felt more relaxed after something happened. Option A states that the professor listened to the whole demonstration, which could have been informative or entertaining, leading to the person feeling more relaxed. Option B is not a plausible answer as it talks about Tom's habit of listening to music when he is tired of studying, which is not related to the given context."}}
{"Q": "They can be easily hurt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gastropods are relatively soft. (B) Hippos are violent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Gastropods are relatively soft.\nExplanation: Gastropods, such as snails and slugs, have soft bodies that lack a protective shell or other hard exterior. This makes them vulnerable to injury from predators, environmental hazards, and even accidental damage from human activity. Therefore, it is more plausible that their vulnerability is due to their physical characteristics rather than the behavior of another animal like hippos."}}
{"Q": "Tom followed the flamingo to go back their habitat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He witnessed death. (B) He found that there are a lot of flamingos.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tom found that there are a lot of flamingos in their habitat as he followed one of them. Witnessing death is not necessarily a common occurrence when following a flamingo to their habitat."}}
{"Q": "I had a Colonoscopy check. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I got terrifed of the instrument for examining the whole colon. (B) The diagnosis showed that this was prolapse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: A colonoscopy is a medical procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for abnormalities or diseases such as polyps, inflammation, or cancer. If the diagnosis showed prolapse, it means that the colon has slipped out of its normal position and may require further treatment. While some people may feel anxious or uncomfortable about the procedure, it is unlikely that someone would become terrified of the instrument itself as a result of a colonoscopy."}}
{"Q": "Frozen chickens weigh more and make more money. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Emily likes to buy processed chickens. (B) Emily likes to sell processed chickens.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Emily likes to sell processed chickens.\nExplanation: If Emily is the one selling the chickens, it would make sense for her to prefer frozen chickens as they have a longer shelf life and can be sold for a higher price due to their increased weight. On the other hand, if Emily was the one buying the chickens for personal consumption, it would be more likely that she would prefer fresh chickens. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack has been working for railroads for many years. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He is familiar with all special procedures. (B) Jack's company mainly uses nanotechnology.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Jack has been working for railroads for many years, it is more plausible that he is familiar with all special procedures related to railroads rather than his company mainly using nanotechnology."}}
{"Q": "The propeller is working. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Only then did the machine gears start to turn. (B) The metal shaft is spinning.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When the propeller is working, it means that the metal shaft is spinning, which is the most plausible result. Option A is not necessarily true as the machine gears could have already been turning before the propeller started working."}}
{"Q": "He went to learn to skate today. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's knowledge has greatly expanded. (B) He skated for hours on the rink.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He skated for hours on the rink.\nExplanation: Since the sentence states that he went to learn to skate, it is more plausible that he spent time practicing and skating on the rink rather than just gaining knowledge about skating. Therefore, option B is a more likely result."}}
{"Q": "There is a report about the daily life of the president. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor diagnosed him as hypertension. (B) The president has a reasonable schedule, regular exercise and a substantial schedule of work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the report about the daily life of the president would highlight his healthy habits and reasonable schedule rather than a diagnosis of hypertension. A president's health is typically closely monitored and any health concerns would likely be addressed privately rather than being reported in the media. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "Tom found a adhesive with top viscosity. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The engine has broken. (B) Susan's cell phone is very hot after use.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The viscosity of an adhesive is not related to the engine of a vehicle. However, high temperatures can affect the viscosity of certain substances, including adhesives. Therefore, it is more plausible that Susan's cell phone being very hot after use could have caused the adhesive to have top viscosity."}}
{"Q": "The man has commited sins such as robbery. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He should take some colchicine. (B) He gets paralysis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He gets paralysis.\nExplanation: Committing sins such as robbery does not have a direct medical treatment like taking colchicine. However, it can have consequences such as legal punishment or societal rejection. In this case, the consequence mentioned is paralysis, which could be a metaphorical punishment or a result of physical injury during the robbery."}}
{"Q": "She sent them into different strange families. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Twins resemble Lucy. (B) Lucy gave birth to twins but couldn't afford the living of them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Lucy gave birth to twins but couldn't afford to raise them, so she sent them to different families. Choice A is not a likely cause as it doesn't explain why Lucy would send the twins to different families."}}
{"Q": "Cathy wears special clothing to protect herslef. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Poor comfort of sackcloth leads to reduced demand. (B) Cathy likes to keep bees in her spare time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Cathy likes to keep bees in her spare time.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because beekeepers often wear protective clothing to prevent bee stings. It is not likely that poor comfort of sackcloth would lead to reduced demand for protective clothing, as comfort is not typically a primary concern when it comes to safety gear."}}
{"Q": "They have found urethanes and carbonic acid. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists wants to explore something related to carbamic acid. (B) Scientists have done a research about the oxidizers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Urethanes and carbonic acid are commonly found as byproducts of the oxidation of organic compounds. Therefore, it is more likely that scientists were researching oxidizers rather than specifically exploring carbamic acid."}}
{"Q": "John wants to know how chromatids appear. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He took use of stoichimetry. (B) The teacher asked him to observe the anaphase of spindle fibers division.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Chromatids appear during the anaphase of spindle fibers division, when the sister chromatids are separated and pulled towards opposite poles of the cell. Therefore, observing the anaphase of spindle fibers division would be a more plausible way for John to learn about how chromatids appear. Stoichiometry, on the other hand, is a branch of chemistry that deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions, and is not relevant to this question."}}
{"Q": "Tom likes geology and biological. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He chooses to study paleontology. (B) He enjoys the scientific art of describing living things.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Paleontology is a field that combines both geology and biology, as it involves the study of fossils and the history of life on Earth. Therefore, it is a plausible choice for someone who likes both geology and biology. Option B is also a possibility, but it is not as directly related to both fields as paleontology."}}
{"Q": "The crab caught the fisherman's hand by its pincers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The little boy suffers from roseola. (B) The fisherman stopped the movement of the crab.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is B because it suggests that the fisherman's action of stopping the movement of the crab caused it to react defensively by catching the fisherman's hand with its pincers. Option A is irrelevant and does not provide any explanation for the situation."}}
{"Q": "Tensiometers failed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Even a little mass could destroy the nerve system. (B) Air bubbles developed in the water column.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Air bubbles developed in the water column is a more plausible answer because it is a common issue with tensiometers. Air bubbles can disrupt the flow of water and cause inaccurate readings, leading to the failure of the instrument. On the other hand, option A seems unlikely as even a little mass would not necessarily destroy the nerve system of a tensiometer."}}
{"Q": "There are hammerheads in the aquarium. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) No antibody will be produced to resist Creatine. (B) They consume a lot of sweets every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: No antibody will be produced to resist Creatine.\nExplanation: The presence of hammerheads in the aquarium is unlikely to have any direct impact on their consumption of sweets. However, it is possible that the hammerheads may carry a pathogen or disease that could affect the production of antibodies in other organisms in the aquarium. This could potentially lead to a lack of resistance to certain substances, such as creatine."}}
{"Q": "He sold his artifacts for a large of money. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John bought some ephemerals. (B) He was in need of money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence states that he sold his artifacts for a large amount of money, implying that he did so because he needed money. Choice A, that John bought some ephemerals, is not related to the sentence and does not provide a plausible explanation for why he sold his artifacts."}}
{"Q": "The valves of the heart closed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The heart relaxed. (B) The heart contracted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The heart relaxed.\nExplanation: When the heart relaxes, the valves close to prevent blood from flowing back into the chambers. This is known as the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. When the heart contracts, the valves open to allow blood to flow out of the chambers, which is known as the systolic phase. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I have a sweet tooth and feel dizzy sometimes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My doctor wants me to be tested for diabetes. (B) I had cancer sometimes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My doctor wants me to be tested for diabetes.\nExplanation: Having a sweet tooth and feeling dizzy can be symptoms of high blood sugar levels, which is a common sign of diabetes. It is important to get tested and receive proper treatment if diagnosed with diabetes to prevent further health complications. Cancer is not typically associated with having a sweet tooth and feeling dizzy."}}
{"Q": "Tom has observed that there some leaves attaching to the trunk. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He recognized that it is a plam. (B) He was upset about the falling leaves.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He recognized that it is a palm.\nExplanation: The fact that Tom observed leaves attaching to the trunk suggests that he was able to identify the type of tree or plant he was looking at. Since the answer choice (A) mentions that he recognized it as a palm, it is the more plausible answer. Answer choice (B) is unlikely because there is no indication that Tom was upset about the leaves falling."}}
{"Q": "Tom's heart beat faster because of smoking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor injected Tom with amiodarone. (B) Tom was banned from smoking by his wife.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom was banned from smoking by his wife.\nExplanation: Smoking can lead to various health problems, including an increased heart rate. Tom's wife may have recognized the negative impact smoking was having on his health and decided to ban him from smoking to improve his overall well-being. On the other hand, the doctor may have prescribed medication or recommended lifestyle changes to address Tom's increased heart rate, but there is no indication in the given information that this occurred. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The soldier was thinking how to kill the dragon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He excluded the usage of dynamite. (B) He excluded the usage of posion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He excluded the usage of dynamite.\nExplanation: Since the soldier was thinking about how to kill the dragon, it is likely that he was considering different methods of attack. By excluding the usage of dynamite, it suggests that he may have considered it as a potential option but ultimately decided against it for some reason. On the other hand, there is no information given to suggest that the soldier considered using poison, so it is less likely to be the result of his thoughts."}}
{"Q": "Fleas bite me today. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I catch a fever. (B) I got a shower today.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Fleas are commonly found in carpets, bedding, and other areas where pets may frequent. Getting a shower would not attract fleas, but it is possible that they were already present in the environment and happened to bite the person after their shower. Catching a fever would not be a direct cause of flea bites."}}
{"Q": "He was resettled in Russia. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack doesn't want to go back to his country. (B) Jack's country is at war.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Jack was resettled in Russia suggests that he was a refugee or displaced person from his home country. The most likely reason for this would be that his country is experiencing conflict or war, making it unsafe for him to remain there. Option A is less likely as it does not provide a clear reason for why Jack would need to be resettled in another country."}}
{"Q": "Tom stores some apple juice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to made some cider. (B) Tom is in charge of the snack supply.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom stores apple juice because he is in charge of the snack supply, rather than wanting to make cider. Making cider requires a specific process and equipment, while storing apple juice for snacks is a more common and practical reason."}}
{"Q": "Historians studied the characteristics of human society in various eras. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They did not find any similarities between different eras. (B) They found that the enactment of law was an essential cornerstone of social development.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Historians have found that the enactment of law has been a crucial factor in the development of human society throughout different eras. While there may be differences in the specific laws and legal systems of different societies, the importance of law in regulating behavior and resolving disputes is a common thread across many cultures and time periods. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer. Option A is unlikely as historians have found many similarities between different eras, such as the importance of religion, trade, and warfare."}}
{"Q": "John gave us a formal presentation of his idea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) More people in us were attracted by it. (B) His personal insights amazed the audience.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. More people in us were attracted by it.\nExplanation: When someone gives a formal presentation of their idea, the goal is usually to persuade others to support or invest in it. Therefore, it is more likely that the result of John's presentation would be that more people were attracted to his idea, rather than just being amazed by his personal insights. While his insights may have been impressive, the focus of the presentation was likely on the idea itself and its potential benefits."}}
{"Q": "The Cockroaches infected Tom. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) All the seedlings in his garden were eaten by them. (B) Tom might have salmonella.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Cockroaches are known to carry and spread diseases such as salmonella, so it is more plausible that Tom might have contracted salmonella from the infected cockroaches rather than them eating all the seedlings in his garden."}}
{"Q": "She often gets nosebleeds. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna puts objects with artificial scent in the corner of her room. (B) Linda likes to rub her nostrils with her fingers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Linda likes to rub her nostrils with her fingers.\nExplanation: Nosebleeds can be caused by irritation or injury to the delicate blood vessels in the nose. Rubbing or picking at the nose can cause this irritation and lead to nosebleeds. While artificial scents may cause some people to experience nasal irritation, it is less likely to be the sole cause of frequent nosebleeds."}}
{"Q": "The man will have a baptism next week. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He will make a public confession in the presence of others. (B) Tom is suffering from heat stroke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Baptism is a religious ceremony where a person publicly declares their faith and commitment to a particular religion. Therefore, it is likely that the man will make a public confession in the presence of others during his baptism. Option B is not related to the given statement and is therefore an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "His body is filled with protein. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom eats an egg every day. (B) Tom always takes into some food which includes chitin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom eats an egg every day.\nExplanation: Eggs are a good source of protein, and consuming them regularly can increase the protein content in the body. Chitin, on the other hand, is a complex carbohydrate found in the exoskeletons of arthropods and is not a significant source of protein for humans. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lucy is suffering from depression. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor gave her some protriptyline. (B) The doctor put her on a ventilato.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The doctor gave her some protriptyline.\nExplanation: Protriptyline is a medication commonly used to treat depression. It works by increasing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain that regulate mood. Therefore, it is a more plausible answer than the doctor putting Lucy on a ventilator, which is a machine used to help people breathe and is not typically used to treat depression."}}
{"Q": "It was stained easily. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I poured some alcohol on the polyester by accident. (B) I poured some oil on the polyester by accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I poured some oil on the polyester by accident.\nExplanation: Polyester is a synthetic fabric that is known to be resistant to stains and wrinkles. However, it is not resistant to oil-based stains. Oil can easily penetrate the fibers of polyester and cause a stain that is difficult to remove. On the other hand, alcohol is not known to stain polyester easily. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the stain was oil rather than alcohol."}}
{"Q": "His computer was infected with a virus. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boy was immersed in the internet. (B) Tom opened an attachment to an unknown email.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Opening an attachment from an unknown email is a common way for viruses to infect a computer. Being immersed in the internet is not necessarily a direct cause of a virus infection."}}
{"Q": "A plant grows towards the light throughout the life. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Phototropism indicates growth towards the light. (B) Phototropism indicates growth against the light.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Phototropism indicates growth towards the light.\nExplanation: Phototropism is a plant's response to light, causing it to grow towards the light source. This is due to the plant's ability to detect the direction of light and adjust its growth accordingly. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is incorrect as it suggests that phototropism causes growth against the light, which is not true."}}
{"Q": "Bossed took care of them immediately. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There were some uncontrollable conditions here. (B) Mom's restaurant lack turkeys.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Mom's restaurant lack turkeys.\nExplanation: This is the more plausible answer as it directly explains why Bossed took care of them immediately. If the restaurant lacked turkeys, it would have been a problem for the business and Bossed would have wanted to rectify the situation as soon as possible to avoid losing customers or revenue. Option (A) is too vague and does not provide a clear reason for Bossed's actions."}}
{"Q": "These carrier particles were close to each other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Strong interactions occur between gluons. (B) Solutes chromatographically interacted with the micelles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Strong interactions occur between gluons.\nExplanation: Gluons are the carrier particles of the strong nuclear force, which is responsible for holding quarks together to form protons and neutrons. Gluons themselves also interact strongly with each other, leading to the formation of bound states called glueballs. Therefore, it is more plausible that the close proximity of the carrier particles is due to the strong interactions between gluons rather than solutes chromatographically interacting with micelles, which is a phenomenon related to chemical separation techniques."}}
{"Q": "Pheasants are going through the brooding stage. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom keeps pheasants in the winter. (B) Tom keeps pheasants in the summer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Pheasants typically go through the brooding stage in the spring and summer months when they are nesting and raising their young. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom keeps pheasants in the summer, which would explain why they are going through the brooding stage. Keeping pheasants in the winter would not be a likely cause for brooding behavior."}}
{"Q": "The biologist present a picture of Hominoids. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The scholar examined it carefully. (B) The audience saw they have no tails.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The audience saw they have no tails.\nExplanation: Hominoids are a group of primates that includes humans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans. One of the distinguishing features of hominoids is that they do not have tails, which sets them apart from other primates. Therefore, it is more plausible that the audience would notice this characteristic rather than a scholar examining the picture carefully."}}
{"Q": "It releases radiation when at work. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The microwave has complex circuits. (B) Electrons,protons and neutrons are the key constituents of material.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Electrons, protons, and neutrons are the key constituents of material, and some materials can release radiation when they undergo radioactive decay. This is a more plausible explanation for the release of radiation than the microwave having complex circuits, which would not typically result in radiation being emitted."}}
{"Q": "The result is in an attenuation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The intensity of the electricity lost. (B) The element in the F region refers to the element whose electrons with the highest energy arranged in the F orbit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Attenuation refers to the decrease in intensity of a signal or energy as it travels through a medium. In this case, the result being in an attenuation suggests that the electricity has lost some of its intensity as it traveled through a medium. Therefore, option A, which states that the intensity of the electricity was lost, is a more plausible answer. Option B, which talks about the element in the F region, is not related to the concept of attenuation and is therefore an incorrect answer."}}
{"Q": "The most advanced group of prosimians in relation to the higher primates controlled this forest. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are many animals in the forest. (B) Tarsiers are the dominant inhabitants in this forest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tarsiers are known to be the most advanced group of prosimians, possessing traits that are more similar to those of higher primates such as monkeys and apes. Therefore, it is more plausible that the dominance of tarsiers in the forest is the cause of their advanced status in relation to higher primates. The presence of many animals in the forest does not necessarily lead to the advancement of a particular group of animals."}}
{"Q": "Most bonsai just begin their growth cycle. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Spring comes. (B) When it comes to winter, trees begin to shrink.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Bonsai trees, like most plants, are affected by seasonal changes. Spring is the time when temperatures rise, days become longer, and there is more sunlight, which triggers the growth cycle of plants. Therefore, it is more plausible that the beginning of the growth cycle of bonsai trees is due to the arrival of spring. Option B is incorrect because trees do not necessarily shrink in winter, but rather become dormant and conserve energy until the next growing season."}}
{"Q": "He ate another snake. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cottonmouth is hungry. (B) This dodo was hungry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The cottonmouth is hungry.\nExplanation: Cottonmouths are known to be opportunistic feeders and will eat a variety of prey, including other snakes. It is more likely that the cottonmouth ate another snake because it was hungry and saw it as a potential food source, rather than a dodo eating a snake, as dodos are extinct and not known to eat snakes."}}
{"Q": "Mike got a firefly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He observed lots of jelly-like material in it. (B) Mike fed it with some small insects.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mike would take care of the firefly by feeding it with small insects rather than observing jelly-like material in it. Fireflies are insects and require food to survive, so feeding it with small insects would be a logical step for Mike to take."}}
{"Q": "The Middle East is short of fresh water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Some countries go to war because of fresh water. (B) Her more severe depression, rather than mine needs a doctor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Some countries go to war because of fresh water.\nExplanation: The scarcity of fresh water in the Middle East has led to tensions and conflicts between countries over access to water resources. For example, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine is partly fueled by disputes over water rights. Similarly, Turkey's construction of dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers has caused tensions with downstream countries like Iraq and Syria, who rely on these rivers for their water supply. Therefore, it is plausible that some countries in the Middle East may go to war over fresh water in the future."}}
{"Q": "Asthma developing late in life doesn't have postive skin tests. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He or she tends to be allergic. (B) He or she tends to be nonallergic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Late-onset asthma is often associated with non-allergic triggers such as respiratory infections, irritants, and stress. Therefore, it is more likely that the person tends to be nonallergic if they do not have positive skin tests."}}
{"Q": "Lucy has a better awareness than Tom when doing work. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She is proved to have a high level of spiritual awareness. (B) Lucy was more successful than Tom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Lucy was more successful than Tom.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Lucy's better awareness helped her in doing work, which implies that she was able to perform better than Tom. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer. Option (A) is not relevant to the given information."}}
{"Q": "This region is of great density. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It has production from local rivers. (B) It has production from local people.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It has production from local people.\nExplanation: A region of great density typically means that there are a lot of people living in that area. Therefore, it is more plausible that the production in the region comes from the local people rather than local rivers. Rivers may contribute to the production, but the primary source would likely be the people living in the area."}}
{"Q": "The polka dotted ski under his fur of that part was revealed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cat was shaved on his back. (B) The criminal pressed his fingers on the spot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the cat was shaved on his back, revealing the polka dotted ski underneath his fur. It is unlikely that a criminal would press their fingers on a specific spot on a cat's back, causing the fur to reveal a pattern."}}
{"Q": "His life is often disturbed by herds or terrible weather. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack's grandfather was a rancher. (B) Tom lives on a prairie.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Tom lives on a prairie suggests that he is likely a farmer or rancher himself, and therefore his life would be affected by herds and weather conditions. Jack's grandfather being a rancher may be a possible explanation for his life being disturbed by herds, but it does not explain the impact of terrible weather."}}
{"Q": "He wanted to eat some nuts to ingest folic acid. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bought some hazelnuts. (B) His mom bought sundews for him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He bought some hazelnuts.\nExplanation: Hazelnuts are a good source of folic acid, so it would make sense for him to buy them to ingest folic acid. Sundews, on the other hand, are carnivorous plants and have no relation to folic acid. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He bought packs of cigarettes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My dad knew his cancer. (B) The boy was under great stress.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The boy was under great stress.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the boy bought packs of cigarettes, but there is no indication that it was due to any health condition like cancer. However, the sentence does suggest that the boy was under great stress, which could be a reason for him to turn to smoking as a coping mechanism. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "She has got the first prize in the Olympics. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This cat can swim in the sea. (B) Liu Xuan has a strong ability to keep balance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that someone named Liu Xuan has won the first prize in the Olympics. Therefore, option B, which states that Liu Xuan has a strong ability to keep balance, is a more plausible answer as balance is an important factor in many Olympic events such as gymnastics, diving, and figure skating. Option A, which talks about a cat swimming in the sea, is not relevant to the given statement and is therefore an unlikely cause for Liu Xuan's achievement."}}
{"Q": "The bears hid in fear. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mangabeys took over the forest. (B) A group of people came to the zoo to watch the bears.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mangabeys took over the forest.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it involves a natural threat to the bears' habitat, whereas the presence of people at a zoo would not necessarily cause fear in wild bears. Mangabeys are also known to be territorial and aggressive, which could cause the bears to hide in fear."}}
{"Q": "They found that chaperones bound to protein. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Biologists use experiments to get proteins into the matrix. (B) He wanted to find infectious proteins without genes of their own.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the chaperones bound to protein were found during an experiment involving the matrix. Choice A provides a plausible explanation that biologists used experiments to get proteins into the matrix, which could have led to the discovery of chaperones bound to protein. Choice B is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide a plausible explanation."}}
{"Q": "It is of liitle use when a car accident really happens. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Remeber to wear a helmet when riding your motocar. (B) Cars have windshields.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Wearing a helmet is not relevant to car accidents as it is meant for motorcycle riders. The statement implies that something could have been done to prevent the car accident, and wearing a helmet while riding a motocar is not a solution."}}
{"Q": "Eric said this building has a majestic appearance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The number of basophils in this poor girl is outside the bounds of normality. (B) Eric carefully checked the properties of this building.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Eric's careful checking of the properties of the building likely revealed its impressive architectural features, leading him to describe it as having a majestic appearance. Choice A is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for the building's appearance."}}
{"Q": "The reported results were mainly involved the childhood stages. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The occurrence of Roseola has been investigated. (B) Susan found many participants for her research.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The question mentions that the reported results were mainly involved in childhood stages. The cause of this is given as \"The occurrence of Roseola has been investigated.\" This suggests that the research focused on investigating the occurrence of Roseola in childhood stages, which is a plausible reason for the reported results being mainly related to childhood stages. On the other hand, option B, which suggests that Susan found many participants for her research, does not provide a clear explanation for why the reported results were mainly related to childhood stages."}}
{"Q": "This is her lifestyles. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jessy only eats vegetables. (B) Emily eats a very healthy diet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Emily's healthy diet is the cause of her lifestyle rather than Jessy only eating vegetables. While a vegetarian diet can be healthy, it is not the only factor that determines one's lifestyle. Emily's overall healthy diet likely includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods, regular exercise, and other healthy habits that contribute to her lifestyle."}}
{"Q": "Mark took some drugs known as mucolytics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The mucus in his lungs was decomposed. (B) His limbic system was activated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The mucus in his lungs was decomposed.\nExplanation: Mucolytics are drugs that help break down and thin out mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up and clear out. Therefore, it is more plausible that the drugs caused the decomposition of mucus in Mark's lungs rather than activating his limbic system, which is responsible for emotions and motivation."}}
{"Q": "John fed the Sculpins with their fish food and herring eggbeds. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Instinct leads him to a normal protein. (B) The Sculpins ate both kinds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The Sculpins ate both kinds.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that John fed the Sculpins with both fish food and herring eggbeds. Therefore, it is more plausible that the Sculpins ate both kinds of food rather than John's instinct leading him to a normal protein."}}
{"Q": "He drank too much recently and his pancreas got inflammed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack has to take haemodialysis due to his kidney cancer. (B) He is diagnosed with pancreatitis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the person's pancreas got inflamed, which is a symptom of pancreatitis. Drinking too much alcohol is a common cause of pancreatitis. Option A is not related to the given statement and is therefore an unlikely cause."}}
{"Q": "Tom was elected as a sheriff. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was reponsible for his own department. (B) The angel gave him a hand.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He was responsible for his own department.\nExplanation: Being elected as a sheriff means that Tom was given the responsibility to lead and manage his own department of law enforcement. This includes overseeing the safety and security of the community, managing the budget and resources of the department, and ensuring that all officers under his command are properly trained and equipped to carry out their duties. Option B, about an angel giving him a hand, is not a plausible answer as it is not related to the responsibilities of a sheriff."}}
{"Q": "They bought lots of mental. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They wanted to make bars. (B) They wanted to make leather.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) They wanted to make bars.\nExplanation: The word \"mental\" is likely a misspelling of \"metal.\" Metal is commonly used in the production of bars, such as steel bars used in construction or gold bars used as a form of currency. It is unlikely that leather would require a significant amount of metal, making option (B) less plausible."}}
{"Q": "She is pregnant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her husband is very happy. (B) He needs to use ultrasound to detect the condition of the fetus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: The fact that she is pregnant means that her husband would need to use ultrasound to detect the condition of the fetus. It is a routine procedure during pregnancy to monitor the growth and development of the fetus. While her husband may also be happy about the pregnancy, it is not necessarily the direct result of her being pregnant."}}
{"Q": "Bananas give off a sweet smell. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The weather has been fine recently. (B) The bananas jack bought were overripe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Bananas give off a sweet smell when they are overripe. This is because the starch in the fruit has converted into sugar, which gives off a sweet aroma. The weather has no direct effect on the smell of bananas."}}
{"Q": "The students pointed directly to the moons. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Geography teacher uses a globe to teach students about geography. (B) The professor asked the students to find natural satellites.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The professor asked the students to find natural satellites.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly explains why the students were pointing to the moons. The professor likely gave the students a task or assignment to identify natural satellites, which led them to point directly to the moons. Choice A, while it involves geography, does not provide a clear reason for why the students were pointing to the moons."}}
{"Q": "Human race has evoluted a little bit. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There is a big sun in the sky. (B) To adapt to new environment, the human gene pool has undergone some changes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The process of evolution occurs when a species undergoes genetic changes that allow it to better adapt to its environment. As humans migrated to different regions and faced new challenges, their gene pool underwent changes that allowed them to survive and thrive in those environments. This is a well-documented scientific phenomenon and is a more plausible explanation than the presence of a big sun in the sky."}}
{"Q": "Crabs can find food by their instinct. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Human beings need nutritious food for their survival. (B) Using chemical stimuli is one of the aminal's instincts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Using chemical stimuli is one of the animal's instincts.\nExplanation: Many animals, including crabs, have the ability to detect and respond to chemical stimuli in their environment. This is known as chemoreception and is an important part of an animal's survival strategy. Crabs use their sense of smell to locate food sources, mates, and potential predators. This instinctual behavior has evolved over time and is essential for the crab's survival in its natural habitat. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This guy believes in spiritualism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He lost the spiritual spark in his life. (B) This guy got religion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: This guy got more in touch with his spiritual side.\nExplanation: Believing in spiritualism typically means that someone is more in tune with their own spirituality and may seek to connect with a higher power or energy. It is unlikely that this belief would cause someone to lose their spiritual spark, and it does not necessarily mean that they would adopt a specific religion. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that this guy got more in touch with his spiritual side."}}
{"Q": "The results showed a range of symptoms from insomnia to death among them. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The biologist came to the iceland. (B) The subjects were given steroids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The cause of the range of symptoms from insomnia to death among the subjects was most likely due to the fact that they were given steroids. Steroids can have a range of side effects, including insomnia, mood swings, and even more serious complications such as heart problems and liver damage. It is important to note that the use of steroids should always be closely monitored by a medical professional."}}
{"Q": "Tom suffered from  gastrointestinal illnesses. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The food  made Tom choke at his spiracle. (B) The food Tom ate contained bacteria.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The food Tom ate contained bacteria.\nExplanation: Gastrointestinal illnesses are often caused by consuming contaminated food or water that contains harmful bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Choking at the spiracle would not cause gastrointestinal illnesses. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He can't stop his hiccups. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has something wrong with his muscles controlling the diaphragm. (B) Tim cannot secrete saliva.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He has something wrong with his muscles controlling the diaphragm.\nExplanation: Hiccups are caused by spasms of the diaphragm muscle, which controls breathing. If there is something wrong with the muscles controlling the diaphragm, it can lead to persistent hiccups. On the other hand, the inability to secrete saliva (choice B) is not related to hiccups."}}
{"Q": "Tom has to overcome all the barriers in front of him. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He finds that each barrier is more difficult than the former one. (B) He finds that all the barriers are the same.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Tom finds that each barrier is more difficult than the former one, it would make sense as it would add to the challenge and make his journey more difficult. It would also show that he is facing increasingly tougher obstacles and needs to work harder to overcome them. On the other hand, if he finds that all the barriers are the same, it would not be as interesting or challenging for him, and it would not make for a compelling story. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Researchers found that lampreys lay eggs in the same way as salmon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scientists want to find the animal with the largest eye among mammals relative to their body weight. (B) Researchers study the spawning habits of lampreys.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The question states that researchers found that lampreys lay eggs in the same way as salmon, indicating that the researchers were studying the spawning habits of lampreys. Choice A is unrelated to the topic of lamprey spawning habits and is therefore less plausible."}}
{"Q": "The doctor's interpretation involved the affected functions of his lungs. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack laid in a coffin. (B) The CT images of Tom's lungs showed Fibrosis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The CT images of Tom's lungs showing Fibrosis is a more plausible cause for the affected functions of his lungs, as Fibrosis is a condition that causes scarring and thickening of the lung tissue, which can lead to breathing difficulties and reduced lung function. Laying in a coffin (choice A) is not a plausible cause for lung function issues."}}
{"Q": "The winter was freezing cold. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Martens all survived the winter in special ways. (B) Martens will die in the cold weather.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Martens all survived the winter in special ways.\nExplanation: Martens are adapted to survive in cold weather and have various ways to cope with freezing temperatures, such as growing thicker fur, storing food, and huddling together for warmth. While some individual martens may not survive due to other factors such as lack of food or shelter, it is unlikely that an entire population of martens would die off simply due to a cold winter. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I saw baby turtles this evening. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I saw pregnant turtles three days ago. (B) The government and families guarantee children's right to receive education.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Seeing baby turtles is most likely due to the fact that the person saw pregnant turtles three days ago, as it takes around 60 days for turtle eggs to hatch. The second choice about children's education is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for seeing baby turtles."}}
{"Q": "The doctor asked him to do some examinations. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom felt something wrong with his body and went to hospital. (B) Stephen went to the hospital.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom felt something wrong with his body and went to hospital.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the doctor asked him to do some examinations, which implies that Tom was already at the hospital and had consulted a doctor. The most plausible reason for this would be that Tom felt something wrong with his body and decided to seek medical attention. Option B, which states that Stephen went to the hospital, is not relevant to the given sentence and does not provide any explanation for why the doctor asked for examinations."}}
{"Q": "They are crawlers. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There are some flowers. (B) There are some small insects.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There are some small insects.\nExplanation: Crawlers are typically small insects that move around on their legs or abdomens. Therefore, it is more plausible that the presence of small insects would cause the observation of crawlers rather than the presence of flowers."}}
{"Q": "This shows that he has a strong ability of viability. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The vet has injected some oxytocins into the dog's body. (B) The fetus has a strong ability to survive independently of the woman's body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the dog's ability of viability is strong, which means that the fetus has a strong ability to survive independently of the woman's body. Option A, which suggests that the vet injected oxytocins, is not a plausible answer as it does not explain the strong ability of viability."}}
{"Q": "He always keeps a healthy body and hardly suffers a disease. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack often goes to the gym. (B) Tom always takes into some food which includes chitin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are known to boost the immune system and reduce the risk of diseases. Going to the gym regularly is a good way to achieve this. On the other hand, chitin is a fibrous substance found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects, and there is no evidence to suggest that consuming it regularly has any significant impact on one's health. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He can teach his own child. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has talents in English. (B) This land is his homestead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that this land is his homestead implies that he has ownership and control over it, including the ability to teach his own child without needing to hire a separate teacher. Tom's talents in English may be a contributing factor, but it is not the main cause of his ability to teach his own child."}}
{"Q": "Too many tasks were assigned to the worker of strong ability. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He worked hard to manage the balance. (B) He reached his limitations and broke down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He reached his limitations and broke down.\nExplanation: Even though the worker had strong ability, assigning too many tasks can lead to burnout and stress. It is not always possible to manage the balance, and eventually, the worker may reach their limitations and break down. This is a common issue in workplaces, and it is important to assign tasks based on the worker's capacity to avoid such situations."}}
{"Q": "The cameraman praised the perfect position of her body parts in relation to each other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The model had a perfect posture. (B) The weather is good for spring outing today.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The model had a perfect posture.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions the position of the model's body parts in relation to each other, which suggests that the cameraman was referring to the alignment and balance of her body. This is typically achieved through good posture, which involves maintaining the natural curves of the spine and keeping the shoulders, hips, and feet in proper alignment. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the sentence and does not provide a logical explanation for the cameraman's comment."}}
{"Q": "All his skeletal muscles in his body contracted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom felt nervous. (B) He took opium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The contraction of all skeletal muscles in the body is a symptom of opium overdose or poisoning. Nervousness may cause muscle tension, but it is unlikely to cause the simultaneous contraction of all skeletal muscles in the body."}}
{"Q": "These albums comfort him when he felt lonely. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is an officer. (B) He kept those albums.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He kept those albums.\nExplanation: The cause of Tom's comfort when feeling lonely is most likely due to the fact that he kept those albums. The albums likely contain music or memories that bring him comfort and remind him of happier times or people he cares about. Being able to listen to or look through these albums can provide a sense of connection and comfort, even when physically alone. The fact that Tom is an officer is not relevant to the question and does not provide a plausible explanation for his comfort."}}
{"Q": "He was very good at raising animals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack's grandfather was a rancher. (B) Mario is keen on doing experiments according to instructions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jack's grandfather was a rancher.\nExplanation: This answer provides a logical explanation for why Jack was good at raising animals. Growing up around a rancher grandfather would have given Jack exposure to animal husbandry and the skills needed to care for animals. Option B, which talks about Mario doing experiments according to instructions, is not relevant to the question and does not provide a plausible explanation for Jack's skills in raising animals."}}
{"Q": "His wife found an internal flaw in the diamond. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary held a funeral for her recently deceased husband last week. (B) Mr. Smith bought a diamond for his wife.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Mr. Smith bought a diamond for his wife.\nExplanation: The cause of the internal flaw in the diamond is most likely due to a manufacturing defect or a flaw in the diamond itself. Choice (A) about Mary holding a funeral for her deceased husband is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for the flaw in the diamond. Therefore, choice (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The intestine makes adaptations, such as the enlarged sacculated parts of the colon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments. (B) Food is digested in the body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The enlarged sacculated parts of the colon are adaptations that allow for more efficient absorption of water and nutrients from digested food. This adaptation is a response to the need to extract as much nutrition as possible from the food that is consumed. The number of myofilaments in myofibrils is not related to the structure of the intestine."}}
{"Q": "This city became famous for tourism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lots of tourists begin their trips. (B) Soon it achieved significant growth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Soon it achieved significant growth.\nExplanation: When a city becomes famous for tourism, it attracts a large number of visitors. This leads to an increase in demand for hotels, restaurants, transportation, and other tourist-related services. As a result, the city experiences significant growth in its economy and infrastructure. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He had been studying where calcification occurs. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found that most of it was in the wrong tissues with accelerated calcification of arteries. (B) The doctor pronounced him dead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He found that most of it was in the wrong tissues with accelerated calcification of arteries.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the person was studying calcification, which is the accumulation of calcium in body tissues. The result of his study was that he found that most of the calcification was occurring in the wrong tissues, which could refer to tissues where calcification is not normal or desirable, such as arteries. The mention of accelerated calcification of arteries supports this interpretation. Option B, which suggests that the person died, is not a plausible answer based on the information given in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "It caught a small fish below the surface. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The trout scrounged for food. (B) The caimen was hungry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The trout scrounged for food.\nExplanation: Trout are known to feed on small fish and insects below the surface of the water. It is a common behavior for them to scrounge for food in this manner. On the other hand, caimans are not known to feed on small fish in this way, making option B less plausible."}}
{"Q": "He can use the knowledge guided by love to help others. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is such a man of generosity. (B) Bob is wise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence states that the person can use knowledge guided by love to help others, implying that they possess wisdom. Option A, which suggests that the person is generous, does not necessarily explain their ability to use knowledge guided by love. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I changed my yard to a garden. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My house lacks collections of plants. (B) Tom planted some broccoli seeds in his yard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My house lacks collections of plants.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the person wanted to add more plants to their property, which is a common reason for starting a garden. Choice B, on the other hand, only mentions one type of plant (broccoli) and does not provide a strong enough reason for completely changing the yard into a garden."}}
{"Q": "It can can change into viscosity quickly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) This sol is thixotropic. (B) The building has weak plasticity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Thixotropy is the property of certain gels or fluids that are thick or viscous under normal conditions but become less viscous over time when shaken or agitated. Therefore, if a sol is thixotropic, it can change into viscosity quickly due to its inherent property. On the other hand, the building's plasticity has nothing to do with the sol's viscosity, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The chemistry teacher used some polymers for experiments. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He took use of some amines. (B) The experiment produced a lot of smoke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions the use of polymers in experiments, but there is no indication that amines were used. However, the statement does suggest that something happened as a result of the experiment, and the production of smoke is a plausible outcome when working with certain polymers. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "The circulating fatty acid in his body is beyond limitation now. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom drank five cups of coffee last night. (B) Tom drank five bottles of beer last night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Drinking alcohol can increase the level of circulating fatty acids in the body, as it impairs the body's ability to metabolize and break down fats. Coffee, on the other hand, does not have a significant effect on fatty acid levels. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lysosomes have less acidic property than the cytosol. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The food thrown into the forest contained with mycotoxins. (B) A higher ph indicates less acidic property.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Lysosomes are organelles that contain hydrolytic enzymes and have an acidic pH of around 4.5. The cytosol, on the other hand, has a neutral pH of around 7.0. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer as it correctly states that a higher pH indicates less acidic property. If lysosomes had a higher pH than the cytosol, it would mean that they are less acidic, which is not the case in normal cellular conditions. Option A is not related to the acidity of lysosomes and is therefore an incorrect answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom needs to study Banach Tarski paradox. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom is proficient in mathematical logic operations. (B) Tom is a math teacher.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom is studying the Banach Tarski paradox because he is a math teacher, rather than being proficient in mathematical logic operations. The Banach Tarski paradox is a complex mathematical concept that is not commonly studied outside of advanced mathematics courses or research. As a math teacher, Tom may be interested in exploring this paradox to deepen his understanding of mathematical concepts and to potentially incorporate it into his teaching curriculum."}}
{"Q": "Tom caught a cold. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a virus spreading in the air of Tom's class. (B) Tom came out of the greenhouse in a T-shirt in winter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There was a virus spreading in the air of Tom's class.\nExplanation: Catching a cold is often caused by a viral infection, and it is more likely that Tom caught the cold from a virus spreading in the air of his class rather than coming out of a greenhouse in a T-shirt in winter. While being exposed to cold temperatures can weaken the immune system and make someone more susceptible to catching a cold, it is not the direct cause of the illness."}}
{"Q": "Scientists have detected up to 26 species. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Geneticists detect the number of blood types in a canine population. (B) Scientists have tested the number of coat color types in a canine population.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Scientists have tested the number of coat color types in a canine population. This is a more plausible answer because coat color is a visible trait that can be easily observed and tested, whereas blood types require more invasive testing methods. Additionally, dogs are known to have a wide range of coat colors and patterns, which could result in a higher number of species being detected."}}
{"Q": "The muscles in her pelvic area became relaxed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The woman was pregnant. (B) The doctor gave Susan relaxin during childbirth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The doctor gave Susan relaxin during childbirth.\nExplanation: Relaxin is a hormone that is naturally produced during pregnancy and childbirth. It helps to relax the muscles and ligaments in the pelvic area, allowing for easier delivery of the baby. Therefore, it is more plausible that the doctor gave Susan relaxin during childbirth to help her muscles relax. Being pregnant alone may not be enough to cause the muscles in the pelvic area to become relaxed."}}
{"Q": "She accidentally shut the botfly in the refrigerator. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After two hours, she found the botfly frozen to death. (B) He could only found some sleeping.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. After two hours, she found the botfly frozen to death.\nExplanation: Botflies are insects that require warm temperatures to survive. Being exposed to cold temperatures for an extended period can lead to their death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the botfly would have died after being accidentally shut in the refrigerator for two hours. Option B, where the botfly is found sleeping, is less likely as botflies are not known to enter a state of hibernation or deep sleep."}}
{"Q": "The pilot found spruces with same height. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The helicopter passed a forest of spruces. (B) Mario and Mary have totally converse arguments about the same issue.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the pilot found spruces with the same height suggests that they were likely planted in a uniform manner, such as in a forest. Option A states that the helicopter passed a forest of spruces, which would explain the uniformity in height. Option B is unrelated and does not provide a plausible explanation for the observation."}}
{"Q": "John was studying the structure of the dendrite. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found that the structure of the dendrite was like a house. (B) He found out the structure like a tree.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John found out the structure of the dendrite was like a tree, as dendrites are often compared to the branches of a tree due to their branching structure. Comparing it to a house would not make as much sense in the context of studying the structure of a dendrite."}}
{"Q": "The meat is moldy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom has put the meat in the refrigerator. (B) Tom lost his legs before many years when he happened to a car accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom has put the meat in the refrigerator.\nExplanation: If the meat is moldy, it is likely due to improper storage or handling. Putting the meat in the refrigerator can slow down the growth of bacteria and mold, but if the meat was already contaminated before being refrigerated, it can still become moldy. Losing one's legs in a car accident has no direct correlation to the meat being moldy."}}
{"Q": "My mother bought me many different vitamins. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I took her to visit crocuses. (B) She thinks my health condition is not very good.", "R": {"text": "Answer: She thinks my health condition is not very good.\nExplanation: The fact that the mother bought many different vitamins for the person suggests that she is concerned about their health and wants to ensure they are getting all the necessary nutrients. This implies that the person may have some health issues or deficiencies that the mother is trying to address. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) is unrelated and does not provide any explanation for why the mother bought the vitamins."}}
{"Q": "Houses are destroyed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Grasshoppers are prevalent in the area. (B) There was a earthquake in the village.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: An earthquake is a more plausible cause for the destruction of houses as it can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. Grasshoppers, while they can cause damage to crops, are unlikely to cause widespread destruction of houses."}}
{"Q": "Women learn that they all miscarry at different times. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Different women chat about miscarry together. (B) Lily is pregnant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Women may learn about the different times of miscarriage from chatting with other women who have experienced it. Miscarriage is a common experience, and women may seek support and advice from others who have gone through it. Through these conversations, they may learn that miscarriage can occur at different stages of pregnancy."}}
{"Q": "Their society was damaged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The two women had harsh Amputation. (B) The people in this modern time didn't follow the culture.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The people in this modern time didn't follow the culture.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the damage to their society was caused by a lack of adherence to their cultural traditions and values in modern times, rather than the harsh amputation of two women. The latter may have been a symptom of the larger issue, but not the root cause."}}
{"Q": "Tom and Lucy were arranged to different positions. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have different responsibilities. (B) They have made different achievements.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They have different responsibilities.\nExplanation: If Tom and Lucy were arranged to different positions, it is likely that they were given different roles or tasks to perform. This would result in them having different responsibilities, as they would be working on different aspects of the job. It is not necessarily true that they would have made different achievements, as their success would depend on how well they performed their respective responsibilities."}}
{"Q": "The two generals are enermies. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They interacted on the battlefield. (B) They slept on the battlefield.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They interacted on the battlefield.\nExplanation: If the two generals are enemies, it is more likely that they would interact on the battlefield in a confrontational manner rather than sleeping together."}}
{"Q": "The irish druid saw ravens. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He used these birds of omen for augury. (B) His limbic system was activated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He used these birds of omen for augury.\nExplanation: Ravens were considered to be birds of omen in Celtic mythology and were often associated with the Morrigan, the goddess of fate and death. As a druid, it is likely that he would have interpreted the sighting of ravens as a sign and used them for divination or augury to gain insight into the future. On the other hand, option B is less likely as the limbic system is responsible for emotions and motivation, and it is not directly related to the interpretation of omens or divination."}}
{"Q": "The student was asked to classify those living things. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had to design the necessary components. (B) The student adopted the method of taxonomy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: The student adopted the method of taxonomy as a result of being asked to classify living things. Taxonomy is the science of naming, describing, and classifying organisms based on their characteristics and relationships. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the task given to the student. Designing necessary components is not relevant to the task of classifying living things."}}
{"Q": "Then the inside of the evaporator will become moldy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The air condition evaporator will get moisture on the surface when refrigeration. (B) The evaporator is abandoned for years.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: When the air conditioner is running, the evaporator coil gets cold and moisture from the air condenses on its surface. If the moisture is not drained properly, it can create a damp environment that promotes mold growth. Therefore, choice A is a more plausible answer than choice B, which suggests that the evaporator is abandoned for years, which is unlikely in a functioning air conditioning system."}}
{"Q": "She built a hut. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna wants to take pictures with a camera. (B) She needed a shelter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She needed a shelter.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for building a hut is to have a shelter. It is a basic human need to have a place to protect oneself from the elements and other dangers. While taking pictures with a camera may be a hobby or interest, it is not a pressing need that would require building a hut. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely cause for building a hut."}}
{"Q": "We slept in a cave last night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We found many crustaceans in the cave. (B) The gems as a kind of mineral are mainly used for decoration and collection because of its brilliant appearance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. We found many crustaceans in the cave.\nExplanation: Sleeping in a cave would not have any direct impact on the use of gems as a decorative item. However, it is possible that sleeping in a cave could lead to the discovery of crustaceans, as they are often found in damp and dark environments like caves. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He kept a pot of flowers at home. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Because there was no sunshine, the flowers withered. (B) The flowers withered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The flowers withered.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it is a common occurrence when plants are not properly cared for. Without proper watering and sunlight, flowers will eventually wither and die. The lack of sunshine is not mentioned in the sentence, so it cannot be assumed as the reason for the flowers withering."}}
{"Q": "After using it she felt better. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The girl used her intuition to diagnose herself. (B) The doctor gave her some plaster.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the doctor gave her some plaster, which likely treated whatever ailment she was experiencing and made her feel better. Option A is less likely as relying solely on intuition to diagnose oneself is not a reliable or recommended method of healthcare."}}
{"Q": "The surrounding animals have mutated. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Signals of high frequency were transmitted to tuataras. (B) The laboratory accidentally leaked radioactive materials containing curium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The laboratory accidentally leaked radioactive materials containing curium.\nExplanation: Radioactive materials can cause mutations in living organisms, and curium is a highly radioactive element. Therefore, it is more plausible that the mutation of the surrounding animals was caused by the accidental leakage of curium from the laboratory rather than high frequency signals being transmitted to tuataras."}}
{"Q": "He uses some ice to induce vasoconstriction. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His legs are swelling out. (B) Tom wants to protect his ankles when he runs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Vasoconstriction is the narrowing of blood vessels, which can help reduce swelling. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of using ice to induce vasoconstriction is that Tom's legs are swelling out, rather than wanting to protect his ankles when he runs."}}
{"Q": "Researchers extracted lovage's components. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They found it on a thinner, heavier crust. (B) A volatile oil angelic acid a bitter extractive resins was found.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Researchers extracted lovage's components and found a volatile oil, angelic acid, and a bitter extractive resin. This is a more plausible answer as it directly relates to the extraction process and the components found in lovage. Option A is unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Atmospheres are not as healthy as before anymore. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These gases pollute the towns and cities. (B) There hasn't been substantial rainfall in this region for a long period.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions that atmospheres are not as healthy as before, which implies that there has been a decline in air quality. Option A suggests that gases are polluting towns and cities, which is a common cause of air pollution. Option B, on the other hand, talks about a lack of rainfall, which may affect the environment in other ways but is not directly related to air quality. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Typhoons frequently occur in coastal areas. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The rainy season is here. (B) The weather is hot in summer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Typhoons are caused by the combination of warm ocean water, moist air, and low atmospheric pressure. The rainy season brings more moisture to the air, which can contribute to the formation of typhoons. Hot weather alone does not necessarily cause typhoons."}}
{"Q": "They would fully focus on the process of carrying out medical experiments. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Pharmacists are cautious about the proportion of medical materials. (B) Positive emotions can heal people's inner heart.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Pharmacists are responsible for ensuring the correct proportion of medical materials in experiments to ensure accurate results and avoid potential harm to patients. Therefore, they would fully focus on the process of carrying out medical experiments to ensure the safety and efficacy of the experiment. Positive emotions may be beneficial for patients, but they are not directly related to the process of carrying out medical experiments."}}
{"Q": "John's office with a macrozamia got fire. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There is nothing wrong with the macrozamia. (B) The ground around it was also damaged.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When a fire occurs, it can damage not only the object that caught fire but also the surrounding area. In this case, John's office caught fire, which means that the macrozamia plant was likely exposed to heat and flames. As a result, it is plausible that the ground around the plant was also damaged."}}
{"Q": "The clear gels cooled my face. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I placed part of aloes on my face. (B) I placed part of chili on my face.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Aloe vera gel is known for its cooling properties and is often used to soothe sunburns or irritated skin. Chili, on the other hand, is known for its heat and would not have a cooling effect on the skin. Therefore, it is more plausible that the clear gels that cooled the face were aloe vera gel."}}
{"Q": "My father was diagnosed with atherosclerosis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We knew it started to growed since many years ago. (B) He went to hospital to treat the long bones.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Atherosclerosis is a condition where plaque builds up in the arteries, causing them to narrow and harden. This can lead to a variety of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. It is a chronic condition that develops over time, so it is likely that the plaque had been growing for many years before your father was diagnosed. Treatment for atherosclerosis typically involves lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise) and medication to manage risk factors like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. In some cases, more invasive procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery may be necessary. There is no mention of long bones being affected by atherosclerosis, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Poverty is equally distributed in that country. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This country embraces capitalism. (B) This country forged a unique model of communism.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is highly unlikely that poverty would be equally distributed in a country that embraces capitalism, as capitalism is based on the accumulation of wealth and resources by individuals or corporations. On the other hand, a unique model of communism could potentially lead to equal distribution of resources and wealth among the population. However, it is important to note that achieving true equality in any economic system is a complex and ongoing process."}}
{"Q": "Sam walked in the mist. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam's shirt got wet. (B) The rough surface of the turbulent water covered his upper body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Sam's shirt got wet.\nExplanation: Walking in mist typically results in getting wet, as mist is essentially tiny droplets of water suspended in the air. It is unlikely that the rough surface of turbulent water would cover Sam's upper body unless he was walking in a body of water, which is not specified in the given sentence. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This patient has schizophrenia. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He regards himself as a stigma. (B) She committed suicide.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He regards himself as a stigma.\nExplanation: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that can cause individuals to experience delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking. It can also lead to social isolation and stigma, as people with schizophrenia may be viewed as unpredictable or dangerous. As a result, individuals with schizophrenia may internalize this stigma and view themselves negatively. While suicide is a risk for individuals with schizophrenia, it is not necessarily a direct result of the diagnosis. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The keepers put them in contact with each other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Spring is the season for animals to reproduct. (B) The animals have been neutered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Spring is the season for animals to reproduce.\nExplanation: Spring is the breeding season for many animals, as the weather becomes warmer and food becomes more abundant. Therefore, it is likely that the keepers put the animals in contact with each other during this time to encourage breeding and reproduction. Option B, stating that the animals have been neutered, would not be a reason for putting them in contact with each other."}}
{"Q": "She had difficulties for the first time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy just started to feed doves. (B) Amy was good at feeding doves.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The sentence states that Amy had difficulties for the first time, implying that she was not used to feeding doves. Therefore, option A, which suggests that Amy just started to feed doves, is a more plausible answer than option B, which states that Amy was good at feeding doves."}}
{"Q": "Jack found that much of the heart is myocardium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack observed the heart of a mouse in the laboratory. (B) John's tonsils got inflamed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Jack most likely observed the heart of a mouse in the laboratory and discovered that much of the heart is myocardium, which is the muscular tissue of the heart. John's tonsils getting inflamed has no relation to the composition of the heart."}}
{"Q": "Tom has done many chemical experiments. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researchers extracted several different components. (B) He took use of the result to stick two pieces of paper together.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it directly relates to the practical application of the experiments. Option A is too vague and does not provide any specific information about the outcome of the experiments."}}
{"Q": "He is prone to lung disease. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor advised him to eat more elderberries. (B) The doctor told him to have more intake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the choices are plausible.\nExplanation: The given choices do not provide a logical or reasonable response to the statement that the person is prone to lung disease. Eating elderberries or having more intake does not directly address or prevent lung disease. A more plausible answer could be that the doctor advised the person to avoid smoking or exposure to pollutants, take medication or inhalers as prescribed, and maintain a healthy lifestyle to improve lung function."}}
{"Q": "The father has commited adultery. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The relationships within his family broke. (B) I trust his discrimination.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The relationships within his family broke.\nExplanation: Adultery is a breach of trust and can cause significant emotional pain and damage to a family. It can lead to feelings of betrayal, anger, and resentment, which can ultimately break down relationships within the family. Therefore, it is more plausible that the father's adultery would result in broken relationships within his family rather than someone trusting his discrimination."}}
{"Q": "People dare not to go near Jack's home. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) This malicious activity was held by mavens. (B) Jack keeps a lot of bulls near his home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Jack keeps a lot of bulls near his home, which makes people afraid to go near it. This is a more logical explanation than choice (A), which mentions \"malicious activity held by mavens,\" but does not provide any context or explanation for what that activity might be. Bulls are known to be aggressive and dangerous animals, so it makes sense that people would avoid going near a home where they are kept."}}
{"Q": "There is something wrong with his lower bowel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The doctor found he had diverticulosis. (B) He was diagnosed with acute appendicitis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The doctor found he had diverticulosis.\nExplanation: Diverticulosis is a condition where small pouches or sacs form in the wall of the colon. It can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. If someone is experiencing issues with their lower bowel, diverticulosis is a more likely diagnosis than acute appendicitis, which is a condition where the appendix becomes inflamed and requires immediate surgical intervention."}}
{"Q": "Tom witnessed the process of Plateletpheresis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He thought it was similar to donating blood except for a few dangers. (B) He thought it was similar to donating blood except for a few exceptions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He thought it was similar to donating blood except for a few exceptions.\nExplanation: Plateletpheresis is a process of collecting platelets from a donor's blood through a machine that separates the platelets and returns the rest of the blood components back to the donor. It is similar to donating blood, but the process takes longer and requires a special machine. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it acknowledges the similarities between the two processes but also recognizes the exceptions that make Plateletpheresis different from regular blood donation."}}
{"Q": "A lot of small particles appeare after the teacher writes on the blackboard. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has got a schematic from his teacher. (B) Jack observes the chalk in the teacher's hand.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When the teacher writes on the blackboard, small particles of chalk dust are released into the air. It is more plausible that Jack observing the chalk in the teacher's hand would cause the particles to appear, rather than Tom receiving a schematic from the teacher."}}
{"Q": "He has a furnace at home. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He observes its movement during daytime. (B) He uses the boiler to heat the food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that he uses the furnace to heat his home or water rather than observing its movement during daytime. Using the boiler to heat food is also a common practice in some cultures."}}
{"Q": "Tom bought a hummingbird on his way home. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hummingbird lives in a healthy way. (B) He cleans its plumages every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The hummingbird lives in a healthy way.\nExplanation: While it is possible that Tom could choose to clean the hummingbird's plumage every day, it is more likely that the hummingbird's well-being would be the result of Tom providing it with proper care and a suitable environment. This could include providing it with a proper diet, a clean and safe living space, and any necessary medical attention. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The giraffe was killed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The lion hunted the giraffe. (B) Two bearcats were raised in the zoo.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The lion hunted the giraffe.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the giraffe was killed by a predator like a lion, as it is a natural occurrence in the wild. Option B, about two bearcats raised in the zoo, does not provide any clear connection to the death of the giraffe."}}
{"Q": "I cooked Fucus vesiculosus for my father. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His thyroid function was promoted for more intake of iodine. (B) He washed it in boil oil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Fucus vesiculosus, also known as bladderwrack, is a type of seaweed that is high in iodine. Iodine is essential for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland, which regulates metabolism. Consuming Fucus vesiculosus can help promote thyroid function by providing the body with more iodine. Therefore, it is more plausible that the consumption of Fucus vesiculosus promoted his thyroid function rather than him washing it in boil oil."}}
{"Q": "Tom wished to cross that canal. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His company gave him a hand. (B) Tom hired a boat and sailed across the canal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since the sentence only mentions Tom's wish to cross the canal, it is more plausible that he would hire a boat and sail across rather than his company giving him a hand, which is not mentioned or implied in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "The helpless cub closes its eyes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It's the first week of the cub after birth. (B) The cub is a month old.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the helpless cub is closing its eyes because it is in its first week after birth. Newborn cubs often keep their eyes closed for the first week or so of their lives as their eyes are not fully developed yet. By the time the cub is a month old, it would have already opened its eyes and started exploring its surroundings."}}
{"Q": "He added starch to the bowl of water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A precipitate soon formed on the fronts. (B) Soon the water was boiling.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. A precipitate soon formed on the fronts.\nExplanation: When starch is added to water, it forms a suspension. Over time, the starch particles will settle to the bottom of the bowl, forming a precipitate. This is a common occurrence when adding a solid to a liquid and is a more plausible outcome than the water boiling, which would require a significant increase in temperature."}}
{"Q": "The professors of the Science Park adjusted the polarization. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The state of the atmosphere is very bad recently. (B) Professors study animals and plants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The state of the atmosphere is very bad recently.\nExplanation: Adjusting polarization is a technique used to improve the quality of images captured by scientific instruments such as microscopes and telescopes. The state of the atmosphere can affect the quality of images by causing distortion and interference. Therefore, it is more plausible that the professors adjusted the polarization due to the bad state of the atmosphere rather than studying animals and plants, which is not directly related to polarization adjustment."}}
{"Q": "Single-celled creature consumes food differently from multi-cellular creature. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) But paramecium is an exception. (B) Squirrels need to prepare food for several weeks in advance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Single-celled creatures, such as paramecium, consume food through a process called phagocytosis, where they engulf food particles with their cell membrane and form a food vacuole. Multi-cellular creatures, on the other hand, have specialized organs and systems for digestion and absorption of nutrients. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer as it acknowledges the exception of paramecium and explains the difference in food consumption between single-celled and multi-cellular creatures. Option B is not relevant to the question and does not provide a logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "He became happier than before. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was sad and he listend to the music. (B) Mr. White saw a bird in the sky.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom was sad and he listened to the music, which made him happier. This is a common experience for many people, as music has the ability to uplift our mood and make us feel better. On the other hand, seeing a bird in the sky may be a pleasant experience, but it is unlikely to have a significant impact on someone's overall happiness."}}
{"Q": "He was forced to pay taxed and fined. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Poor John doesn't want to pay taxes. (B) The millionaire put a price tag on the valueless leave.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that he was fined and taxed, but it doesn't mention anything about his personal beliefs or actions regarding taxes. The second choice provides a more plausible reason for the fines and taxes, as it suggests that someone with power and wealth has manipulated the situation for their own gain."}}
{"Q": "My mom keeps cleaning in my room. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I keep sneezing. (B) It is  a cockroach-infested apartment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the mom keeps cleaning in the room, it is likely that dust and other allergens are being stirred up, causing the person to sneeze. A cockroach-infested apartment would not necessarily be a direct result of the mom cleaning in the room."}}
{"Q": "The farmer measured the hardness of a wheat kernel. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found it has a high percentage of salts. (B) The PSI he got was 5.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The measurement of hardness of a wheat kernel would not necessarily provide information about the percentage of salts present. However, measuring the PSI (pounds per square inch) would give an indication of the kernel's hardness. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a new pilot. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He has to attend flight schools. (B) He can't enjoy his life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: As a new pilot, Tom would need to attend flight schools to gain the necessary knowledge and skills to safely operate an aircraft. This is a standard requirement for anyone pursuing a career in aviation. It is unlikely that he would be unable to enjoy his life simply because he is a new pilot."}}
{"Q": "Many helpers came to aid the flood hit area. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Among them are children, adults and old men. (B) Situations of this area got much better.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement suggests that many helpers came to aid the flood hit area, which implies that the situation was dire and required assistance. Therefore, it is more plausible that the situation of the area got much better as a result of the aid provided by the helpers. Option A is irrelevant to the question and does not provide any information about the outcome of the helpers' aid."}}
{"Q": "He saw ants on the petals. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom picked up some eucalyptus blossom. (B) This boy had hyperactivity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom picked up some eucalyptus blossom, which had ants on it. Ants are known to be attracted to sweet and sugary substances, and eucalyptus blossoms are known to produce nectar, which could have attracted the ants. On the other hand, hyperactivity in a boy would not be a likely cause for ants being on the petals."}}
{"Q": "The environment is clean. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It is a good place for canaries to live. (B) The vegetation grows well.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: When the environment is clean, it means that there are no pollutants or harmful substances that can hinder the growth of vegetation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the vegetation grows well in a clean environment. While canaries may also benefit from a clean environment, it is not necessarily the most logical outcome."}}
{"Q": "There is a male pig and a female big in the pigpen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has gained a lot of profits. (B) They have a small pig baby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the male and female pig would mate and produce offspring, resulting in a small pig baby. Option (A) about gaining profits does not make sense in the context of the given information."}}
{"Q": "The farmer picked the ripen melon up. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Farmers want to buy some strychnine. (B) The tendril nearest the watermelon turned brow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The tendril nearest the watermelon turning brown is a sign that the melon is ripe and ready to be picked. This is a common indicator for farmers to know when to harvest their crops. Option (A) about buying strychnine is unrelated and does not provide a logical explanation for why the farmer picked the melon."}}
{"Q": "These abalones were too small to be sold. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mother usually cooks whelks for him. (B) They were kept for reproducing baby abalones.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Since the abalones were too small to be sold, it is likely that they were kept for reproducing baby abalones. This would allow the abalone farmer to continue their business and eventually sell larger abalones in the future. Option (A) about the mother cooking whelks is unrelated and does not provide a logical consequence of the abalones being too small to be sold."}}
{"Q": "Kings seek addresses. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An address stresses one's presence. (B) There was a murder case in this area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is (B) because if there was a murder case in the area, the king would want to know the address of the suspect or witnesses to the crime. Seeking addresses would be a way for the king to gather information and potentially solve the case. On the other hand, (A) is not a strong reason for kings to seek addresses as there are other ways to show one's presence."}}
{"Q": "Tom begins his puberty. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His adulthood ends. (B) His childhood ends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Puberty is the period of physical and sexual development that marks the end of childhood and the beginning of adolescence. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom's childhood ends as a result of beginning his puberty."}}
{"Q": "He sang into the microphone. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sound waves are converted to electrical voltages. (B) Sound waves are converted to electrical resistance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: When someone sings into a microphone, the sound waves produced by their voice are converted into electrical voltages by the microphone's diaphragm. These electrical signals are then transmitted through the microphone cable to an amplifier or recording device, where they can be further processed or recorded. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer. Option (B) is incorrect as sound waves are not converted to electrical resistance."}}
{"Q": "First only his head was hot, now his whole body is hot. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Zachary has been bothered by migraine pain for hours. (B) Tom got a fever.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The symptom of a hot head followed by a hot body is more indicative of a fever, which is commonly caused by an infection or illness. Migraine pain may cause a hot head, but it is unlikely to cause a sudden increase in body temperature. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Anurans are hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They will have a physiological reaction when they meet the prey. (B) Anurans begin to hate drinking water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: When anurans are hungry, they will have a physiological reaction when they meet the prey. This is because hunger triggers the release of certain hormones and enzymes that prepare the body for digestion and absorption of nutrients. As a result, anurans will be more alert and responsive to potential prey, and their digestive system will be ready to process the food efficiently. There is no reason for anurans to hate drinking water just because they are hungry."}}
{"Q": "The willow sapling died. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The little moose was alone beside the street. (B) Tom forgot to water the willow saplings.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom forgot to water the willow saplings, which caused the sapling to die. The fact that the little moose was alone beside the street is not related to the death of the sapling."}}
{"Q": "John wanted to raise a semi-hardy perennial. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His company gave him a hand. (B) He raised buttercups.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The question states that John wanted to raise a semi-hardy perennial, which means he was looking to grow a specific type of plant. Option A, which suggests that his company helped him, does not relate to the question at all. Option B, which suggests that he raised buttercups, is a more plausible answer as it is a type of semi-hardy perennial that can be grown in gardens."}}
{"Q": "Mary had good results in recent practice tests. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her skating speed on the ice has increased significantly. (B) She got satisfactory results in the formal test.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Mary got satisfactory results in the formal test. The practice tests were a good indicator of her performance, which led to her doing well in the actual test. There is no direct correlation between good results in practice tests and an increase in skating speed on the ice."}}
{"Q": "Jenny's breasts are stunted. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She used Pasteurization to kill them. (B) Doctors diagnosed low estrogen levels in her body.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Stunted breast growth can be caused by a variety of factors, including low estrogen levels. Therefore, it is more plausible that doctors diagnosed low estrogen levels in Jenny's body as the cause of her stunted breasts rather than her using Pasteurization to kill them, which is not a known method for breast reduction."}}
{"Q": "They all died prematurely. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Those creepers were not provided with any diet here. (B) Many of his pet birds were malnourished.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The fact that \"many of his pet birds were malnourished\" suggests that the cause of their premature deaths was likely related to their lack of proper nutrition. While the lack of diet for the creepers may have also contributed, the statement specifically mentions the malnourishment of the birds."}}
{"Q": "Tom came into contact with a rhinovirus patient. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom made sure that the patient was fine. (B) Tom got bronchitis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Rhinovirus is a common cause of the common cold, and it can also lead to bronchitis. Therefore, it is more likely that Tom would have contracted bronchitis rather than making sure the patient was fine."}}
{"Q": "Many beautiful facets appeared which makes the diamond more shining. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John polished the diamond perfectly. (B) Lucy loves her dog.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The cause of the diamond appearing more shining is most likely due to John polishing it perfectly. Lucy loving her dog has no correlation to the diamond's appearance."}}
{"Q": "More and more habitats of wild animals are well protected. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The diversity of animals increased. (B) Most of them live a healthy life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: When habitats of wild animals are well protected, it allows for the preservation of their natural environment and resources. This can lead to an increase in biodiversity as different species are able to thrive in their natural habitats without human interference. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer. While option B may also be true, it is not necessarily a direct result of habitat protection and may depend on other factors such as availability of food and water."}}
{"Q": "How well the vessels function can be defined. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have a neutralization reaction. (B) People use reactivity to indicate the vessels function.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement suggests that the vessels' function can be defined by reactivity, which means how well they react to certain substances or conditions. This is a more plausible answer than neutralization reaction, which is a specific chemical reaction and may not necessarily be related to vessel function."}}
{"Q": "The god inparted me a divine life changing my nature. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has made a lot of researches in archaeology. (B) I got regeneration.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Getting regeneration is a more plausible answer as it aligns with the concept of divine intervention and transformation of one's nature. Archaeology research, on the other hand, is not directly related to the idea of divine intervention."}}
{"Q": "The third rail is the most busy one. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There are three rails in my hometown. (B) The dry season is here.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The statement mentions that \"the third rail is the most busy one\", which implies that there are at least three rails in the area. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer as it provides a reason for the third rail being the busiest without any contradiction to the given statement. Option (B) is irrelevant and does not explain why the third rail is the busiest."}}
{"Q": "Jack watched a soccer game. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack died in a car accident. (B) Jack saw wonderful headshots.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack saw wonderful headshots during the soccer game rather than dying in a car accident as a result of watching the game."}}
{"Q": "She helps residents in the community a lot. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary is a policewomon in that community. (B) Children in the village lack of education.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement mentions that she helps residents in the community a lot, but there is no mention of her being a policewoman. On the other hand, the lack of education among children in the village could be a reason for her to help the community. It is possible that she is involved in providing education or other resources to the children, which in turn benefits the entire community."}}
{"Q": "They studied the chemical components of several fruits. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They found both kiwis and papaya have proteine-splitting enzyme. (B) They found  kiwis and papaya have no same components.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Based on the given information, it is more plausible that the researchers found that both kiwis and papaya have proteine-splitting enzyme, as this is a specific detail about the chemical components of these fruits. Option (B) is too general and does not provide any specific information about the results of the study."}}
{"Q": "He got a three-dimensional image of the earth. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jerry used tomography when observing the earth. (B) Jerry used map when observing the earth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Tomography is a technique used to create a three-dimensional image of an object by taking multiple two-dimensional images from different angles and combining them. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jerry used tomography when observing the earth to get a three-dimensional image. Using a map would not result in a three-dimensional image."}}
{"Q": "Jack ate an expired can and went into a coma. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was diagnosed with botulism. (B) He died of the ingestion of cyanide.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Eating expired food can lead to the growth of harmful bacteria, which can cause food poisoning. In this case, Jack's symptoms suggest botulism, which is a serious illness caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It can lead to paralysis and even death if left untreated. Cyanide poisoning is not a likely outcome of eating an expired can."}}
{"Q": "Voldemort is a potential evil mage. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He is out of shape. (B) Voldemort became the ultimate villain in the end.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Voldemort's potential as an evil mage led him to become the ultimate villain in the end. He was a powerful wizard who sought to dominate the wizarding world and was responsible for numerous atrocities, including the deaths of many innocent people. His actions and beliefs made him a formidable opponent for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and ultimately led to his downfall."}}
{"Q": "She decided to watch the whole movie. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy has waited for Tom for a long time. (B) Lucy doesn't  know why the girl was killed in the trailer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The fact that Lucy doesn't know why the girl was killed in the trailer suggests that she is curious and wants to find out the answer by watching the whole movie. Therefore, (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The researchers finally chose shellfish. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Only the fishes that reach weight will be selected. (B) This research needs to choose a creature with no head but complex life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The reason for choosing shellfish is that they have complex life cycles but no head, which makes them suitable for the research. Option A is not relevant to the decision to choose shellfish."}}
{"Q": "All kinds of white blood cells were damaged to some extent. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Neutrophils known as grapes were damaged. (B) Neutrophils known as granulocytes were damaged.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that are also known as granulocytes. Therefore, if all kinds of white blood cells were damaged, it is more plausible that the neutrophils known as granulocytes were damaged rather than just the specific subset of neutrophils known as grapes."}}
{"Q": "He was unwilling to go to the dams. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was sick of mud. (B) He wanted to find smail single-celled ocean plants smaller than the size of a pinhead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The fact that he was unwilling to go to the dams suggests that he had been there before and had a negative experience, possibly involving mud. There is no indication in the sentence that he had any interest in finding small single-celled ocean plants."}}
{"Q": "Her mother told her that it was rosemaries. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary grabbed a bunch of some kind of plant with foliage and asked what' s it. (B) The old lady likes watching the only annual in the garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that Mary grabbed a bunch of some kind of plant with foliage and asked her mother what it was. Her mother then identified it as rosemaries. This explanation is more plausible than option B, which is not supported by any information in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "He cut the stick with a saw. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom wants to split a wooden stick in two. (B) Tom got a piece of iron stick.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The sentence states that Tom cut the stick with a saw, which implies that he wanted to split the stick in two. Option A is more plausible as it aligns with the action described in the sentence. Option B is not a likely cause as it introduces a new element (iron stick) that is not mentioned in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "This old man died. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He died of lung cancer. (B) His whole life ended.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the old man died of lung cancer. This would be a specific cause of death, whereas saying his whole life ended is too general and doesn't provide any specific information about what happened to him."}}
{"Q": "No matter what their gender is, all people can take any transportation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Everyone is equal. (B) There are many aircrafts at the airport.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The statement suggests that regardless of gender, all people have the same ability to take any form of transportation. This implies that there is no discrimination based on gender, and everyone is considered equal in terms of their access to transportation. Therefore, the most plausible cause of this is that everyone is equal."}}
{"Q": "The mice tried to look around for the softest material. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They built nests with the materials they found. (B) They ate the materials they found.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the mice were searching for soft materials to build their nests with, so it is more plausible that they built nests with the materials they found rather than eating them."}}
{"Q": "His legs are entangled in duckweed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Duckweed can become food for fish. (B) Tom was standing in the river and can't move a step.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"his legs are entangled in duckweed,\" which implies that Tom was standing in the river and got stuck in the duckweed, unable to move. Choice (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not explain how Tom's legs got entangled in the duckweed."}}
{"Q": "He adores rug making desperately. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom hit the kernels. (B) Mike is crazy about the ancient crafts of Oman.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is (B) because it directly relates to the subject of rug making and shows a passion for ancient crafts. Option (A) about Tom hitting kernels is unrelated and does not provide any explanation for the adoration of rug making."}}
{"Q": "The ancestors took their descendants to a new habitat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The latter became used to it. (B) They share habitats.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more likely that the descendants became used to the new habitat over time as they adapted and evolved to their new surroundings. Sharing habitats with their ancestors may have been possible, but it is not necessarily the most plausible outcome."}}
{"Q": "There are several kinds of mites living in the chicken coop. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) These mites attack poultry. (B) These mites attack kittens and puppies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Mites are known to be a common problem in chicken coops and can cause harm to the poultry by feeding on their blood and causing irritation and stress. Therefore, it is more plausible that these mites would attack poultry rather than kittens and puppies."}}
{"Q": "Susan was accused for plagiarism. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom has only attended one contest. (B) Susan used John's intellectual property without permission.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The cause of Susan being accused of plagiarism is that she used John's intellectual property without permission. This is a clear violation of copyright laws and academic integrity. Tom attending only one contest has no relevance to the accusation of plagiarism."}}
{"Q": "He often learns about bacteria for his study. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jerry is allergic to pollen. (B) Tom studies Transduction in microrganisms.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Tom studies Transduction in microorganisms, which would require him to learn about bacteria. Allergy to pollen (choice A) is not related to the study of bacteria."}}
{"Q": "The little boy collected some paper used in stamp printing. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He liked to touch the watermarks on  it. (B) He decided to go to Canada first.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the little boy would be interested in touching the watermarks on the paper used in stamp printing, as it is a common feature of such paper and could be intriguing to a child. Going to Canada first seems like a random and unlikely outcome."}}
{"Q": "This insect lives on the cuticle of plants. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It only stays on all the aboveground green parts of plants. (B) They are planted in the backyard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Since the insect lives on the cuticle of plants, it is likely that it only stays on the aboveground green parts of plants, as the cuticle is a waxy layer on the surface of leaves and stems. The fact that plants are planted in the backyard is not relevant to the behavior of the insect."}}
{"Q": "His grades will determine whether he can go to university or not. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John's GCSE results will be out soon. (B) He is a student.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The statement mentions that \"his grades will determine whether he can go to university or not\", which implies that the cause of this is his upcoming GCSE results. Being a student is not a sufficient cause for determining university admission, but good grades are. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Those steep slopes are covered with vegetation. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) You can see many muskrats burrow there. (B) Earthquakes and floods always take place.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The presence of vegetation on steep slopes indicates that the soil is stable and can support plant growth. This makes it a suitable habitat for burrowing animals like muskrats. There is no indication that earthquakes and floods always take place as a result of the vegetation."}}
{"Q": "The water level of the stream rises sharply in spring. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It's early spring now. (B) The stream in front of Tom's house almost dried up in winter when there was little precipitation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The fact that the stream almost dried up in winter when there was little precipitation suggests that the water level is directly related to the amount of precipitation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the sharp rise in water level in spring is due to increased precipitation during that season. Option (A) is not a plausible explanation as it only states the current season without any relation to the water level."}}
{"Q": "Attention is still under study. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Only people from America were required to give their comments on the issue. (B) Neurological processes haven't been thoroughly studied.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Attention is a complex cognitive process that involves various neurological processes. While there has been significant research on attention, there is still much to be understood about how it works and how it can be improved. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer as it highlights the ongoing research in the field of neuroscience to better understand attention. Option (A) is not a valid explanation as it does not relate to the cause of attention being under study."}}
{"Q": "We need a machine and sugar cane. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We want to make rum. (B) Our army have requirements for soilders.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The process of making rum involves using a machine to extract the juice from sugar cane, which is then fermented and distilled to produce the final product. Therefore, the need for a machine and sugar cane is more likely to be for the purpose of making rum rather than for meeting the requirements of an army."}}
{"Q": "Different sizes of embolis are detected in its arteries. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An old monkey is sick with embolis in its brain. (B) Biologists observe the parts of the methyls.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The presence of different sizes of embolis in the arteries suggests that there is a blockage in the blood vessels, which could be caused by a clot or debris that has broken off from somewhere else in the body and traveled to the brain. This is a common occurrence in older individuals and could be a sign of a serious medical condition such as a stroke or heart disease. Biologists observing the parts of the methyls would not be relevant to this situation."}}
{"Q": "The shrimp was hunted down by the billfish. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A billfish saw a shrimp in a distance. (B) A billfish smelt a shrimp.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Billfish, like many predatory fish, have a keen sense of smell and can detect the scent of prey from a distance. Therefore, it is more likely that the billfish was attracted to the scent of the shrimp rather than simply spotting it from a distance."}}
{"Q": "A hyena got lost in the forest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was scard and wanted to found its partners. (B) Her sight was harmed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the hyena got scared and wanted to find its partners as hyenas are social animals and usually live in groups. Getting lost in the forest would cause fear and anxiety, and the hyena would naturally try to find its way back to its group for safety and comfort. There is no indication or reason to believe that its sight would be harmed as a result of getting lost in the forest."}}
{"Q": "His collegues told him the location of Parsnips. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The closest relatives of parsley in the family Apiaceae was Tom's new interest. (B) Tom was looking for actinoid on the periodic table of elements.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The fact that Tom's colleagues told him the location of Parsnips suggests that he was looking for it specifically. Option A provides a plausible reason for this, as Tom's new interest in the closest relatives of parsley in the family Apiaceae would naturally lead him to seek out information on Parsnips. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the topic of Parsnips and therefore unlikely to be the cause of Tom's search."}}
{"Q": "Follicles show features of impassability at all stages of development. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Atresia means impassability. (B) Shortly after birth, newborns are exposed to trillions of bacteria.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\n\nExplanation: Atresia is a medical term that refers to the absence or closure of a natural passage in the body. In the context of follicles, atresia means the degeneration and resorption of follicles that do not mature or ovulate. This can lead to the appearance of impassable follicles at all stages of development. On the other hand, exposure to bacteria shortly after birth is not directly related to the development of follicles and their features."}}
{"Q": "There was a lot of litter in this water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The pool had serious problem of pollution. (B) Many marine animals died because of this.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The presence of litter in the water indicates a problem of pollution, but it does not necessarily mean that marine animals died as a result. However, it is important to address the issue of pollution to prevent harm to the environment and its inhabitants."}}
{"Q": "He exposed the juice to oxygen for a period of time. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He feeds it with plants. (B) Vitamin C in the juice is decomposited.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: When juice is exposed to oxygen for a period of time, the vitamin C in the juice is decomposed. This is because vitamin C is an antioxidant that reacts with oxygen and breaks down, leading to a loss of its nutritional value. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) is not relevant to the question and does not explain what happens when juice is exposed to oxygen."}}
{"Q": "The result showed that it stimulated proliferation of bone cells in vitro. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He studyed how protons were made. (B) He was injected with androgen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The cause of the stimulation of bone cell proliferation in vitro was likely due to the injection of androgen, as this hormone is known to promote bone growth and development. The study of how protons are made would not be directly related to bone cell proliferation."}}
{"Q": "Hinds tended to stay away from these areas. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Hinds died in feeding areas provided by humans until winter. (B) Hinds stayed in feeding areas provided by humans until winter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The sentence states that Hinds tended to stay away from these areas, implying that they did not frequent feeding areas provided by humans. Option A provides a plausible reason for this behavior, as it suggests that Hinds may have died in these areas due to human interference. Option B contradicts the sentence and is therefore not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It was severely sunburnt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hippo was locked in a cage under the sun. (B) The kudzu was exposed to the sunlight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Hippos are not typically exposed to direct sunlight for extended periods of time in their natural habitat. Therefore, it is more plausible that the hippo was locked in a cage under the sun, leading to severe sunburn."}}
{"Q": "He knew much about Ceres. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My father used to be a friar. (B) He studies the largest object in the asteroid belt.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that he studies the largest object in the asteroid belt, which is Ceres. This would explain why he knows much about it. Option A, that his father used to be a friar, does not provide a clear connection to Ceres."}}
{"Q": "He saw that nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions was taking place. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The experimenter wants to do electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. (B) The chemist combined anhydrides with a variety of nucleophiles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions involve the reaction of a nucleophile with an acyl group, typically in the presence of a catalyst or activating agent. Anhydrides are commonly used as acylating agents in these reactions, and a variety of nucleophiles can be used to generate different products. Therefore, the most plausible explanation for the observed reaction is that the chemist combined anhydrides with a variety of nucleophiles to carry out nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions. Option (A) is not a plausible explanation as electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions do not involve acyl groups or nucleophiles."}}
{"Q": "They made no response. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Signals of low frequency were transmitted to tuataras. (B) Signals of high frequency were transmitted to tuataras.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Tuataras are known to have poor hearing and are only able to detect low-frequency sounds. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lack of response was due to the transmission of signals of high frequency, which the tuataras would not have been able to hear."}}
{"Q": "Most of them chose to eat steak. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A group of  men went to a restaurant for dinner. (B) The new guests coming in the famous steakhouse were four blokes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that \"they\" chose to eat steak, implying that a group of people made the decision. Option A states that a group of men went to a restaurant for dinner, which is a more plausible cause for a group of people choosing to eat steak. Option B only mentions four blokes coming into a steakhouse, which may not necessarily lead to everyone in the restaurant choosing to eat steak."}}
{"Q": "Some substances reacted with the acid. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The polyphosphates worked on the amino acids. (B) Acid was added to the sample of urine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Adding acid to a sample of urine can cause a chemical reaction with certain substances present in the urine, leading to the observed reaction. The polyphosphates working on amino acids is not a likely explanation for this reaction."}}
{"Q": "It turned out to contain chemicals called cannabinoids. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A chemist examined the chemicals contained in marijuana. (B) Tom put carbon monoxide together with compounds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (A) because cannabinoids are naturally occurring chemicals found in marijuana plants. A chemist would be the most likely person to identify and examine these chemicals. On the other hand, carbon monoxide is a toxic gas and would not be intentionally combined with compounds."}}
{"Q": "Tom is a student majoring in the paleoanthropology. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He ,ainly studies about the human evolution. (B) He did a lot of researches about fossil plants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Since Tom is majoring in paleoanthropology, which is the study of human evolution and prehistoric human societies, it is more plausible that he mainly studies about the human evolution rather than doing researches about fossil plants."}}
{"Q": "Ancestors of dogs and wolves lived in the same circumstances for thousands of years. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Now their offsprings are almost the same. (B) Most of them live a healthy life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The ancestors of dogs and wolves lived in the same circumstances for thousands of years, which led to the development of similar physical and behavioral traits. As a result, their offspring, dogs and wolves, share many similarities in terms of their physical appearance, behavior, and genetic makeup. However, this does not necessarily mean that they all live a healthy life, as many factors can affect their health and well-being."}}
{"Q": "Kittiwakes are always hungry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kittiwakes eat amount of food every day. (B) They feed the fish to supplement fat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Kittiwakes are always hungry, which means they need to eat a certain amount of food every day to sustain themselves. Therefore, it is more plausible that they eat a certain amount of food every day rather than feeding the fish to supplement fat."}}
{"Q": "His mother made quick bread made with a leavening agent such as baking powder for him. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John was very tired after a long day of work. (B) He wanted to eat biscuits.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The fact that his mother made quick bread with a leavening agent such as baking powder suggests that John wanted to eat biscuits or some other type of bread that required a leavening agent. Being tired after a long day of work would not necessarily be a reason for his mother to make quick bread specifically with a leavening agent."}}
{"Q": "The workers of this factory went to the southern hemisphere to look for darker materials. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The factory wanted to mine olivine. (B) Factory hired workers to extract terpenes from evergreen trees.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The mention of \"darker materials\" suggests that the workers were looking for a mineral or rock that is naturally dark in color. Olivine is a common mineral that can be found in dark shades of green, black, and brown, making it a plausible material for the factory to mine. On the other hand, terpenes are organic compounds found in plants and are not typically associated with darker materials."}}
{"Q": "Jewelry can make her crazy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary loves things of clarity. (B) Some cuckoos are tired after flying for hours.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (A) Mary loves things of clarity. This suggests that Mary has a strong affinity for jewelry that is clear and sparkly, which can make her crazy with excitement. It is unlikely that the cause of her excitement would be related to tired cuckoos, as this is not relevant to the topic of jewelry."}}
{"Q": "They observed apes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They hear sounds from those apes. (B) Most of them suffered from sarcoidosis.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Observing apes would likely result in hearing sounds from them, as apes are known to communicate through vocalizations. Sarcoidosis, on the other hand, is a rare disease that is not typically associated with observing apes."}}
{"Q": "Many of the patients were suffering from demtelinating diseases, including some with multiple sclerosis. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Most of them have achondroplasia. (B) Doctors examined them and found many oligodendrocytes in their bodies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The statement mentions that many of the patients were suffering from demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis. This suggests that there may be a problem with the production or function of oligodendrocytes, which are responsible for producing myelin in the central nervous system. Therefore, it is more plausible that doctors examined the patients and found many oligodendrocytes in their bodies, rather than them having achondroplasia, which is a genetic disorder that affects bone growth and has no direct connection to demyelinating diseases."}}
{"Q": "They found something connected with therapsids. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Scientists recently did a research about mammals. (B) The teacher asked them to study some oldest flowering plants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The finding of something connected with therapsids suggests that scientists recently did a research about mammals, as therapsids are an extinct group of mammal-like reptiles. The teacher asking students to study oldest flowering plants would not be related to the discovery of something connected with therapsids."}}
{"Q": "She took in enterokinase. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Other enzymes in her body were activated. (B) It tooked in approximately twice the protein levels of grass.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Enterokinase is an enzyme that activates trypsinogen to trypsin in the small intestine. It does not affect the protein levels of grass or any other food. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer as enterokinase will activate other enzymes in the body, specifically trypsin, which will aid in the digestion of proteins."}}
{"Q": "There is not enough polypropylene for Tom to do his research. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He has to take measures. (B) He tooke use of some polyethylene instead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Since there is not enough polypropylene for Tom to do his research, he would have to take measures to either find an alternative material or source more polypropylene. Using polyethylene instead may not be a viable solution as it may not have the same properties or characteristics needed for his research. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This instrument can detect any thermal energy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The instrument detected the wave. (B) It tests the energy the Pendula have.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Since the instrument can detect any thermal energy, it is more likely that it detected the wave rather than testing the energy of the Pendula."}}
{"Q": "Betty was infected with  salmonella. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her baby is no healthy. (B) Betty was having diarrhea.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Salmonella infection commonly causes symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. While it is possible for a pregnant woman with salmonella to pass the infection to her baby, it is not a common outcome. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The experimenter found that new substances were produced. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mixing ozone and lightning. (B) The laboratory adopted radioimmunoassays.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Mixing ozone and lightning can lead to the production of new substances through chemical reactions. Radioimmunoassays, on the other hand, are a laboratory technique used for measuring the concentration of substances in biological samples and would not directly lead to the production of new substances."}}
{"Q": "The milk tastes sour. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom pasteurized the sour milk. (B) The bacteria in milk has changed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The most likely cause of sour milk is the growth of bacteria in the milk, which causes it to ferment and produce lactic acid. Pasteurization is a process that kills bacteria, so if Tom had pasteurized the milk, it would not have become sour. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "He saw that flounders were among the shortest bars. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom saw a histogram of the survival rate of marine life. (B) Tom looked at a pie chart of nationalities.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The mention of \"survival rate of marine life\" suggests that Tom was looking at data related to marine life, which would be more relevant to the size of flounders. A pie chart of nationalities would not have any correlation to the size of flounders."}}
{"Q": "Their weight were under the standard. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) During the war children suffered from a deficiency of food. (B) The athlete was fencing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The statement suggests that multiple people had a weight below the standard, which is more likely to be caused by a deficiency of food during a war, as opposed to one athlete participating in a specific sport."}}
{"Q": "We can eat tomatoes regularly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lycopene is beneficial to us. (B) Ryan wants to eat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Lycopene, a powerful antioxidant found in tomatoes, has been shown to have numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer. Therefore, it is more likely that the reason we can eat tomatoes regularly is due to the health benefits of lycopene rather than Ryan's personal preference."}}
{"Q": "Soon the cow will have offsprings. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Humans produce lots of halons today. (B) A cow on the farm is pregnant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that a cow on the farm is pregnant, which is a natural cause for the cow to have offspring. Option (A) about humans producing lots of halons today is not related to the cow having offspring."}}
{"Q": "We learned how to comprehend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teacher taught us how to read. (B) The general used many Missiles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Comprehension is a skill that is developed through reading and understanding written text. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of learning how to comprehend was due to the teacher teaching the students how to read and understand written text. The use of missiles by a general has no correlation to the development of comprehension skills."}}
{"Q": "Her curse had a beginning with no end. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A scientist puts some nucleolytic enzymes into some series of dna double helix. (B) The cursed girl had a life of eternity.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The option (B) seems more plausible as it directly relates to the curse being eternal. Option (A) talks about a scientific experiment which may not necessarily lead to a curse with no end."}}
{"Q": "We can easily find gars in water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Loggerheads atre abundant in the sea. (B) The gar is a kind of fish that needs to breath in water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The gar is a type of fish that is adapted to living in water and needs to breathe in water to survive. Therefore, it is common to find gars in water. The abundance of loggerheads in the sea is not related to the presence of gars."}}
{"Q": "The number of sheep grew widely and the grassland decreased rapidly thereafter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had many pupae. (B) The local hunters killed too many wolves this year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (A) He had many pupae. This suggests that the increase in sheep population was due to the reproduction of the sheep themselves, rather than any external factor such as the local hunters killing too many wolves. Additionally, the decrease in grassland could be attributed to the increased grazing pressure from the growing sheep population."}}
{"Q": "Soon, he died of worsening liver disease. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Despite his cirrhosis, Bob still drank heavily. (B) John has asthma.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the person had worsening liver disease, which is often caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Choice (A) suggests that despite having cirrhosis, the person continued to drink heavily, which could have led to the worsening of their liver disease and ultimately their death. Choice (B) about asthma is not relevant to the given statement."}}
{"Q": "Tom was going to catch doves. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He paid close attention to the trees. (B) He went to the farm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Since the question only mentions Tom's intention to catch doves, it is more plausible that he would pay close attention to the trees to locate them rather than randomly going to a farm."}}
{"Q": "The period of summer rains comes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The carbon dioxide, one of the major greenhouse gases, content in the air decreases. (B) Many wildflowers bloom in profusion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The period of summer rains provides the necessary moisture for many wildflowers to bloom in profusion. This is a common phenomenon in many regions where summer rains are a regular occurrence. On the other hand, the carbon dioxide content in the air is not directly affected by the summer rains, and it is unlikely to decrease as a result."}}
{"Q": "The number of enzymes in Tom's body is over the average number. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can always digest protein better than others. (B) His body is very healthy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The number of enzymes in Tom's body being over the average number would mean that he can always digest protein better than others. This is because enzymes are responsible for breaking down proteins into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. Therefore, having more enzymes would result in better protein digestion. The statement does not provide any information about Tom's overall health, so option (B) cannot be the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "This folk eat many root tubers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They grow Dahlias for food. (B) They collect many fibres.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Option (A) about growing Dahlias for food seems unlikely as Dahlias are not commonly used as a food source. Option (B) about collecting many fibres seems more plausible as some root tubers, such as yams and cassava, are known to have fibrous roots that can be used for various purposes such as making ropes and baskets."}}
{"Q": "Propanol has different properties. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Propanol is a simple example of isomer. (B) Propanol is a compound.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Propanol is a simple example of isomer, meaning it has the same chemical formula as another compound but a different arrangement of atoms. This can result in different physical and chemical properties, such as boiling point, melting point, and solubility."}}
{"Q": "Mario is a fastener. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He can easily lift a heavy case. (B) He applies solder to many welding surfaces every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Being a fastener does not necessarily mean that Mario can easily lift a heavy case. However, it is more plausible that he applies solder to many welding surfaces every day as this is a common task for someone in the fastening industry."}}
{"Q": "Her body had excessive radiation levels. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy overexposed her skin to the ultraviolet rays of the sun. (B) Madame Curie studied radium all her life.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Madame Curie studied radium all her life, which is a highly radioactive element. It is possible that she was exposed to high levels of radiation during her research, leading to excessive radiation levels in her body. On the other hand, overexposure to ultraviolet rays of the sun (option A) can cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer, but it does not lead to excessive radiation levels in the body."}}
{"Q": "Their company has a team culture. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They have unified structures. (B) Everyone, including the boss, is a team player.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If a company has a team culture, it is more likely that everyone, including the boss, is encouraged to be a team player. This means that individuals work together towards a common goal, collaborate, and support each other. While having unified structures may be a result of a team culture, it is not necessarily the most plausible outcome."}}
{"Q": "The old man ate Benzodiazepines by mistake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was poisoned. (B) He had amnesia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Benzodiazepines are a type of medication used to treat anxiety and insomnia. While taking too much of this medication can be dangerous, it is unlikely that the old man would be poisoned by eating them by mistake. Instead, he may experience side effects such as drowsiness, confusion, and memory problems, which could lead to amnesia. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Anna needs an amniocentesis. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary wants to detect condition in the fetus. (B) It can't grow normally.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Amniocentesis is a prenatal test that involves taking a sample of amniotic fluid to detect any genetic abnormalities or chromosomal disorders in the fetus. It is usually recommended for women who are at high risk of having a baby with a genetic condition, such as women over the age of 35 or those with a family history of genetic disorders. Therefore, the most plausible reason for Anna needing an amniocentesis is that Mary wants to detect any conditions in the fetus. Option B, \"It can't grow normally,\" is not a common reason for needing an amniocentesis."}}
{"Q": "He brought good news to others. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His major job is evangelism. (B) Jack used to be a soothsayer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If someone is bringing good news to others, it is more likely that their job involves spreading positive messages, such as an evangelist. Being a former soothsayer would not necessarily lead to bringing good news to others."}}
{"Q": "He tried to caught the bass. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bass bit him with its small mouth. (B) The bass opened its mouth and guzzled his hand.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the bass bit him with its small mouth as a defensive reaction to being caught. It is unlikely that the bass would open its mouth and guzzle his hand as it is not a typical behavior for fish."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to the dentist to fix his caries. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The treatment process producedamalgam waste. (B) The doctor said that Tom had high blood pressure.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The question is about Tom going to the dentist to fix his caries, which is related to dental treatment. Therefore, it is more plausible that the treatment process produced amalgam waste, which is a common byproduct of dental procedures that involve fillings or other restorative work. On the other hand, the doctor saying that Tom had high blood pressure seems unrelated to the context of the question and is less likely to be a result of the dental treatment."}}
{"Q": "He was diagnosed with something wrong with ventricular. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim, who has a medical history with hypertension, recently felt uncomfortable. (B) Jack's lungs were infected with bacteria.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Tim's medical history with hypertension is a risk factor for developing ventricular problems, such as ventricular hypertrophy or heart failure. Feeling uncomfortable could be a symptom of these conditions, leading to a diagnosis of something wrong with the ventricular. On the other hand, Jack's lung infection is unlikely to cause ventricular problems."}}
