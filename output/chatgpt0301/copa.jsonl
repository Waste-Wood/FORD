{"Q": "The item was packaged in bubble wrap. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was fragile. (B) It was small.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Bubble wrap is commonly used to protect fragile items during shipping or transportation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the item was packaged in bubble wrap because it was fragile and needed extra protection."}}
{"Q": "I emptied my pockets. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I retrieved a ticket stub. (B) I found a weapon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Since the options are limited to a ticket stub or a weapon, it is more plausible that the person retrieved a ticket stub from their pockets rather than finding a weapon. Finding a weapon in one's pockets would be highly unusual and alarming, whereas finding a ticket stub is a common occurrence."}}
{"Q": "Termites invaded the house. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The termites disappeared from the house. (B) The termites ate through the wood in the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The termites ate through the wood in the house.\nExplanation: Termites are known for feeding on wood, and when they invade a house, they can cause significant damage by eating through the wooden structures. Therefore, it is more plausible that the termites ate through the wood in the house rather than disappearing on their own."}}
{"Q": "The travelers reached the border. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The patrol agent checked their passports. (B) The patrol agent accused them of smuggling.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The patrol agent checked their passports.\nExplanation: When travelers reach a border, it is common for patrol agents to check their passports to verify their identity and ensure they have the necessary documentation to enter the country. Accusing them of smuggling without any evidence would be an extreme and unlikely scenario. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The office was closed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was a holiday. (B) It was summer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It was a holiday.\nExplanation: The most common reason for an office to be closed is due to a holiday. It is less likely for an office to be closed solely because it is summer, as many businesses operate year-round regardless of the season."}}
{"Q": "The girl ran out of energy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She played checkers. (B) She jumped rope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She jumped rope.\nExplanation: Jumping rope is a physical activity that requires a lot of energy and can quickly tire out a person. Playing checkers, on the other hand, is a sedentary activity that does not require much physical exertion. Therefore, it is more likely that the girl ran out of energy because she was jumping rope."}}
{"Q": "The woman lost her place in line. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) More people entered the line. (B) She stepped out of the line.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She stepped out of the line.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly states that the woman herself did something that caused her to lose her place in line. Option (A) suggests that other people caused her to lose her place, which is possible but not necessarily the most likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "The girl pinched her nose. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The baby drooled on her bib. (B) The baby soiled her diaper.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The baby soiled her diaper.\nExplanation: Pinching one's nose is a common reaction to a foul odor. Therefore, it is more plausible that the girl pinched her nose because the baby soiled her diaper and caused an unpleasant smell. Drooling on a bib, on the other hand, would not typically produce a strong enough odor to warrant such a reaction."}}
{"Q": "The band played their hit song. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The audience clapped along to the music. (B) The audience politely listened in silence.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The audience clapped along to the music.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the audience would react positively to the band's hit song by clapping along to the music, rather than politely listening in silence. A hit song is usually a crowd-pleaser and would elicit a lively response from the audience."}}
{"Q": "The girl wanted to thank her math teacher. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The girl stayed after school for detention. (B) The girl brought the teacher an apple.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The girl brought the teacher an apple.\nExplanation: Bringing an apple to a teacher is a common way to show appreciation and gratitude. It is unlikely that the girl would receive detention for wanting to thank her teacher. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The young campers felt scared. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their camp counselor told them a ghost story. (B) They toasted marshmallows on the campfire.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Their camp counselor told them a ghost story.\nExplanation: The cause of the young campers feeling scared is most likely due to their camp counselor telling them a ghost story. Ghost stories are often told to create a spooky atmosphere and scare listeners, especially when told around a campfire at night. Toasting marshmallows on a campfire is a common camping activity and is unlikely to cause fear or anxiety in young campers."}}
{"Q": "The man hit his head. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got lost in thought. (B) He got a concussion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He got a concussion.\nExplanation: When someone hits their head, it is possible for them to suffer a concussion, which is a type of traumatic brain injury. Symptoms of a concussion can include confusion, memory loss, headache, and dizziness. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man got a concussion as a result of hitting his head."}}
{"Q": "The check I wrote bounced. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My bank account was empty. (B) I earned a pay raise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My bank account was empty.\nExplanation: If the check bounced, it means that there were insufficient funds in the account to cover the amount of the check. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer as it directly relates to the cause of the bounced check. Option B, earning a pay raise, has no direct correlation to the check bouncing."}}
{"Q": "The man's email inbox was full of spam. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He deleted the spam. (B) He sent out a mass email.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He deleted the spam.\nExplanation: It is a common practice to delete spam emails from the inbox to keep it organized and to avoid missing important emails. Sending out a mass email is not a logical solution to a full inbox of spam."}}
{"Q": "The sailor was quarantined. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was exposed to the disease. (B) He recovered from the disease.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He was exposed to the disease.\nExplanation: Quarantine is a measure taken to prevent the spread of a contagious disease. If someone is quarantined, it means they have been exposed to the disease and are being isolated to prevent further spread. Option B, that he recovered from the disease, would not require quarantine as the person is no longer contagious. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl memorized the code. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She recited it to herself. (B) She forgot to write it down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She recited it to herself.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the girl memorized the code by reciting it to herself rather than forgetting to write it down. Reciting information is a common method of memorization, especially if the girl needed to remember the code for a specific purpose. Forgetting to write it down would not necessarily lead to memorization, as the girl could have simply asked for the code again or found another way to access the information."}}
{"Q": "I poured the water into the glass. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The water quenched my thirst. (B) The glass became full.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The glass became full.\nExplanation: When water is poured into a glass, the most likely result is that the glass becomes full. While it is possible that the person pouring the water was thirsty and drank it, the statement does not provide any indication of this. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man remained silent when his friend finishing speaking. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wanted to offer his friend support. (B) He was thinking about his friend's words.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man remained silent because he was thinking about his friend's words. If he wanted to offer support, he would likely say something to acknowledge his friend's feelings. However, the fact that he remained silent suggests that he was processing what his friend had said and thinking about how to respond."}}
{"Q": "The accident was my fault. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I felt guilty. (B) I pressed charges.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I felt guilty.\nExplanation: Since the accident was the speaker's fault, it is more plausible that they would feel guilty about what happened. Pressing charges would be unlikely unless there was significant damage or injury caused by the accident."}}
{"Q": "The chain came apart. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The chain was wrapped around a tire. (B) There was a broken link in the chain.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There was a broken link in the chain.\nExplanation: A broken link in the chain is a more plausible cause for the chain coming apart than it being wrapped around a tire. If the chain was wrapped around a tire, it would likely cause the chain to become tangled or twisted, but not necessarily come apart completely. A broken link, on the other hand, would cause the chain to separate and come apart."}}
{"Q": "The couple decided to compromise. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They grew tired of arguing. (B) They avoided discussing the problem.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They grew tired of arguing.\nExplanation: The word \"compromise\" implies that there was a disagreement or conflict between the couple. If they avoided discussing the problem, there would be no need for a compromise. Therefore, it is more likely that they reached a compromise because they were tired of arguing and wanted to find a solution that would satisfy both parties."}}
{"Q": "The woman decided to run for public office. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She hired a campaign manager. (B) She testified in court.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She hired a campaign manager.\nExplanation: Running for public office requires a lot of work and organization, and hiring a campaign manager is a common step for candidates to take. Testifying in court is not necessarily related to running for public office and would not be a direct result of the woman's decision to run."}}
{"Q": "The man anticipated cold weather on his trip. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He packed warm clothing in his suitcase. (B) He travelled with a big suitcase.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He packed warm clothing in his suitcase.\nExplanation: Since the man anticipated cold weather on his trip, it is more likely that he would pack warm clothing in his suitcase to prepare for the weather. Travelling with a big suitcase is not necessarily related to anticipating cold weather."}}
{"Q": "The student knew the answer to the question. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He raised his hand. (B) He goofed off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He raised his hand.\nExplanation: If the student knew the answer to the question, it is likely that they would raise their hand to share their knowledge with the teacher and the rest of the class. Goofing off would not be a plausible response in this situation."}}
{"Q": "The man's eyes watered. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dust got into his eyes. (B) He put goggles over his eyes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Dust got into his eyes.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that dust got into his eyes, as this is a common cause of eye irritation and watering. Goggles would not typically cause a person's eyes to water unless they were too tight or uncomfortable, which is not indicated in the sentence."}}
{"Q": "The player won five games in a row. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her opponent accused her of cheating. (B) Her opponent felt sorry for her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Her opponent became more determined to win.\nExplanation: Winning five games in a row would likely make the opponent feel challenged and motivated to try harder to win the next game. It is unlikely that the opponent would accuse the player of cheating or feel sorry for them."}}
{"Q": "The teacher tore up the student's exam. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He caught the student cheating. (B) The student's answers were incorrect.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) He caught the student cheating.\nExplanation: Tearing up a student's exam is a severe action that a teacher would take only in extreme cases. If the student's answers were incorrect, the teacher would likely give feedback and a grade. However, if the teacher caught the student cheating, tearing up the exam would be a reasonable consequence."}}
{"Q": "I paused to stop talking. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I lost my voice. (B) I ran out of breath.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I ran out of breath.\nExplanation: Pausing to stop talking is a common occurrence when someone runs out of breath while speaking. It is unlikely that someone would pause due to losing their voice, as they would likely continue speaking in a whisper or attempt to clear their throat. Running out of breath is a more plausible explanation for the pause."}}
{"Q": "The frozen food thawed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I put it in the microwave. (B) I covered it with plastic wrap.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Putting the frozen food in the microwave would cause it to thaw, while covering it with plastic wrap would not have any effect on its temperature."}}
{"Q": "The employee faked sick. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had stomach cramps. (B) He wanted a day off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that the employee \"faked\" being sick suggests that they were not actually experiencing any physical symptoms. Additionally, the phrase \"wanted a day off\" implies that the employee had a motive for pretending to be sick, which supports choice B as the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl landed in the pool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She ran on the pool deck. (B) She jumped off the diving board.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the girl jumped off the diving board and landed in the pool. If she had run on the pool deck, she would have likely slipped and fallen before reaching the pool. Jumping off the diving board is a common activity in a pool and would explain how she ended up in the water."}}
{"Q": "The movie tickets sold out. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was opening day for the movie. (B) The movie received poor reviews.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It was opening day for the movie.\nExplanation: It is common for popular movies to sell out on their opening day, as many people are excited to see the film as soon as possible. Poor reviews may deter some people from seeing the movie, but it is unlikely to cause a complete sell-out of tickets. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man lost weight. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) People isolated him. (B) People complimented him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. People complimented him.\nExplanation: When someone loses weight, it is common for people to notice and compliment them on their achievement. It is unlikely that people would isolate someone for losing weight, as weight loss is generally seen as a positive change. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl's hands became blistered. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She typed up a letter. (B) She climbed up a rope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She climbed up a rope.\nExplanation: Climbing up a rope requires a lot of physical effort and can cause friction between the rope and the hands, leading to blisters. Typing up a letter does not typically cause blisters on the hands."}}
{"Q": "The circus performer juggled while riding a unicycle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The audience cheered in astonishment. (B) The acrobat swung from a trapeze.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The audience cheered in astonishment.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the audience would be impressed and amazed by the circus performer's juggling skills while riding a unicycle, rather than the acrobat suddenly swinging from a trapeze. Juggling while riding a unicycle is a difficult and impressive feat that would likely garner applause and cheers from the audience."}}
{"Q": "I lost my patience. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My friend kept me waiting. (B) My friend arrived on time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My friend kept me waiting.\nExplanation: It is more likely that losing patience was caused by waiting for someone who was late rather than someone who arrived on time. Waiting for someone who is late can be frustrating and can lead to impatience."}}
{"Q": "The warring countries wanted peace. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They developed nuclear weapons. (B) They negotiated a treaty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They negotiated a treaty.\nExplanation: When warring countries want peace, the most plausible solution is to negotiate a treaty. This involves both sides coming to an agreement on terms that will end the conflict and establish a peaceful relationship going forward. Developing nuclear weapons would not necessarily lead to peace and could actually escalate the conflict. Therefore, negotiating a treaty is the most likely outcome when warring countries seek peace."}}
{"Q": "The man took sleeping medication. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He became drowsy. (B) He ran a fever.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He became drowsy.\nExplanation: Sleeping medication is designed to induce drowsiness and help a person fall asleep. It is unlikely that taking sleeping medication would cause a fever, so option B is not a plausible answer. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "The woman bumped into the sofa. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The leg of the sofa came loose. (B) She bruised her knee.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She bruised her knee.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the woman would suffer a minor injury like a bruised knee from bumping into a sofa rather than causing damage to the furniture itself."}}
{"Q": "The boy squeezed the balloon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The balloon popped. (B) The balloon flew away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The balloon popped.\nExplanation: When a balloon is squeezed, the air inside is compressed and the pressure increases. If the pressure becomes too great, the balloon will burst or pop. Therefore, it is more plausible that the balloon popped as a result of the boy squeezing it."}}
{"Q": "They travelers checked into their hotel room. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They unpacked their suitcases. (B) They went to the airport.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) They unpacked their suitcases.\nExplanation: It is common for travelers to unpack their suitcases after checking into a hotel room as they need to settle in and organize their belongings. Going to the airport would not be a logical result of checking into a hotel room."}}
{"Q": "I bit into the peach. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The peach bruised. (B) Juice spilled out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Juice spilled out.\nExplanation: When you bite into a peach, the flesh is soft and juicy, so it is more likely that juice would spill out rather than the peach bruising."}}
{"Q": "My hands became sticky. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I ate a doughnut. (B) I had a sweet tooth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I ate a doughnut.\nExplanation: Doughnuts are often coated in sugar or glaze, which can make your hands sticky when you touch them. This is a common occurrence when eating doughnuts, so it is a more plausible explanation than simply having a sweet tooth."}}
{"Q": "I pushed the door. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The door opened. (B) The door locked.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The door opened.\nExplanation: When you push a door, it is more likely to open than lock. Pushing a door in the direction it is meant to open will cause it to move and allow you to enter or exit the room. Therefore, it is more plausible that the door opened as a result of being pushed."}}
{"Q": "Activists boycotted the products. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The products were tested for quality assurance. (B) The products were manufactured through child labor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The products were manufactured through child labor.\nExplanation: Activists often boycott products that are manufactured through child labor as it is considered unethical and exploitative. Testing for quality assurance is a standard practice and is unlikely to be the cause of a boycott."}}
{"Q": "I drilled a hole in the wall. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A mouse crawled out of the hole. (B) Dust blew out of the hole.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Dust blew out of the hole.\nExplanation: It is more likely that drilling a hole in the wall would result in dust blowing out, as opposed to a mouse crawling out. While it is possible that a mouse could have been living in the wall, it is not the most likely outcome of drilling a hole."}}
{"Q": "The woman felt envious of her sister. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her sister was happy. (B) Her sister got divorced.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Her sister was happy.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the woman felt envious of her sister, which implies that her sister had something that she wanted. The only information given about the sister is that she was happy, so it is more plausible that the cause of the woman's envy was her sister's happiness rather than her sister's divorce."}}
{"Q": "I spilled wine on my shirt. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I put on an apron. (B) I changed my shirt.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I changed my shirt.\nExplanation: It is more likely that someone would change their shirt after spilling wine on it rather than putting on an apron, which is typically used to prevent spills while cooking or working with messy materials. Changing the shirt would be the more practical solution to avoid staining or smelling like wine."}}
{"Q": "The cashier opened the cash register. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The customer searched his wallet. (B) The customer handed her money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the customer handed the cashier money, which prompted her to open the cash register to make change or complete the transaction. Option A is less likely as the customer searching their wallet would not necessarily require the cashier to open the cash register."}}
{"Q": "The street musician attracted a crowd. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People gave him change. (B) He sent the crowd away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. People gave him change.\nExplanation: It is common for street musicians to receive tips or change from the crowd that gathers around them. Therefore, it is more plausible that people gave him change rather than him sending the crowd away."}}
{"Q": "The little boy cried to his babysitter. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He missed his parents. (B) It was snack time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The little boy crying to his babysitter suggests that he is upset or emotional about something. While snack time may be a cause for excitement, it is unlikely to cause tears. On the other hand, missing his parents is a common cause of distress for young children when they are separated from their primary caregivers. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The pilot's radar detected a storm. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The pilot navigated away from the storm. (B) The pilot flew through the storm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The pilot navigated away from the storm.\nExplanation: It is common practice for pilots to avoid flying through storms as they can be dangerous and cause turbulence. Therefore, it is more plausible that the pilot would navigate away from the storm to ensure the safety of the passengers and crew."}}
{"Q": "The tree shed its leaves. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The leaves turned colors. (B) The leaves accumulated on the ground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The leaves accumulated on the ground.\nExplanation: When a tree sheds its leaves, the leaves fall off and accumulate on the ground. Option A, \"The leaves turned colors,\" is not a direct result of the tree shedding its leaves, as leaves change color before they fall off the tree. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy was in a mischievous mood. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided to play a card game with his sister. (B) He decided to play a practical joke on his sister.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He decided to play a practical joke on his sister.\nExplanation: The word \"mischievous\" implies a desire to cause trouble or play pranks. Playing a card game with his sister does not necessarily fit this description, while playing a practical joke does. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The child complained that he had to go to the bathroom. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His father gave him a soda to drink. (B) His father stopped the car at a gas station.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His father stopped the car at a gas station.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the father would stop at a gas station to allow the child to use the bathroom rather than giving him a soda to drink, which would only make the situation worse. Stopping at a gas station would provide a suitable place for the child to use the bathroom and address his needs."}}
{"Q": "The child sprinkled fish food into the tank. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fish leapt out of the tank. (B) The fish swam towards the food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The fish swam towards the food.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the fish would be attracted to the food and swim towards it, rather than leaping out of the tank. Fish are known to have a strong sense of smell and are able to detect food in the water, so it is natural for them to swim towards it when it is added to their tank."}}
{"Q": "The woman's political views changed. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She switched her party affiliation. (B) She engaged in a protest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She switched her party affiliation.\nExplanation: Changing political views can lead to a change in party affiliation, as the woman may no longer align with the values and beliefs of her previous party. Engaging in a protest is a possible action that could result from a change in political views, but it is not necessarily the most likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "The bathroom sink was clogged. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I turned on the faucet. (B) I poured drain cleaner into it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I poured drain cleaner into it.\nExplanation: If the bathroom sink was clogged, turning on the faucet would not have solved the problem and may have even made it worse by causing the water to overflow. Pouring drain cleaner into the sink is a more plausible solution as it can dissolve the blockage and clear the drain."}}
{"Q": "The passengers got off the train. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The train arrived at the station. (B) The train blared its whistle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The train arrived at the station.\nExplanation: When a train arrives at a station, it is common for passengers to get off the train. Blaring the whistle is not a common reason for passengers to get off the train. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man pressed down on the moist flap of the envelope. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He put a stamp on the envelope. (B) He sealed the envelope shut.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He sealed the envelope shut.\nExplanation: Pressing down on the moist flap of an envelope is a common way to seal it shut. Putting a stamp on the envelope does not require pressing down on the flap, and it would not seal the envelope shut. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The friends lost touch. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They enjoyed each other's company. (B) They moved to different cities.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They moved to different cities.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the friends lost touch because they moved to different cities, which would make it more difficult to maintain regular contact and meet up in person. While enjoying each other's company is important for maintaining friendships, it is not necessarily the cause of losing touch."}}
{"Q": "The accountant mismanaged the company's funds. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was fired from her position. (B) She went on maternity leave.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She was fired from her position.\nExplanation: Mismanaging company funds is a serious offense and can lead to financial loss for the company. Therefore, it is likely that the accountant would be terminated from her position for such negligence. Maternity leave is not a relevant consequence in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "I looked at the clock. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I heard the clock tick. (B) I wanted to check the time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the person wanted to check the time, as this is a common reason for someone to look at a clock. Hearing the clock tick may also draw someone's attention to the clock, but it is less likely to be the sole cause of someone looking at the clock."}}
{"Q": "My hand cramped up. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wrote the essay by hand. (B) My wife and I held hands.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I wrote the essay by hand.\nExplanation: Writing for an extended period of time can cause hand cramps due to the repetitive motion and strain on the muscles in the hand. Holding hands with someone would not typically cause a hand cramp."}}
{"Q": "The bolt tightened. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I replaced the bolt. (B) I twisted the wrench.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I twisted the wrench.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the bolt tightening is that someone applied force to it with a wrench, which would be twisting the wrench. Replacing the bolt would not necessarily cause it to tighten, as it could still be loose if not properly secured."}}
{"Q": "The couple signed a lease for an apartment. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The couple moved into the apartment. (B) The city condemned the apartment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The couple moved into the apartment.\nExplanation: Signing a lease typically means that the couple has agreed to rent the apartment and will move in as tenants. Option B, where the city condemns the apartment, is not a likely outcome immediately after signing a lease."}}
{"Q": "The woman sat outside on the porch. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She wanted to watch the sunset. (B) She thought she saw lightning.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She wanted to watch the sunset.\nExplanation: The sentence does not mention any storm or bad weather, so option B is less likely. On the other hand, sitting outside on the porch is a common activity to enjoy the view and relax, especially during sunset. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man wore a lifejacket in the water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He couldn't swim. (B) The water was shallow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He couldn't swim.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for a person to wear a lifejacket in the water is that they cannot swim. Lifejackets are designed to keep a person afloat and prevent drowning, which is especially important for non-swimmers or weak swimmers. The fact that the man is wearing a lifejacket suggests that he is taking precautions to stay safe in the water despite his lack of swimming ability. On the other hand, if the water was shallow, there would be less need for a lifejacket as the person could easily stand up or walk to safety."}}
{"Q": "The woman made a typo in the word processor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She deleted the document. (B) She hit the backspace key.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She hit the backspace key.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the woman would simply hit the backspace key to correct the typo rather than deleting the entire document. Deleting the document would be an extreme and unnecessary action for a simple typo."}}
{"Q": "The girl bragged to her friends. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She got a bad grade. (B) She won a contest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She won a contest.\nExplanation: Bragging is usually associated with boasting about something positive or impressive. Winning a contest is a common reason for someone to brag to their friends, as it is a notable achievement that they may want to share and celebrate with others. Getting a bad grade, on the other hand, is typically not something someone would brag about."}}
{"Q": "The lawn was muddy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It poured overnight. (B) It was full of weeds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It poured overnight.\nExplanation: The word \"muddy\" suggests that there was water on the lawn, and the most likely reason for this is rain. Choice A states that it poured overnight, which is a plausible explanation for the muddy lawn. Choice B, which suggests that the lawn was full of weeds, does not provide a logical reason for the lawn being muddy."}}
{"Q": "The woman overslept. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She stayed the night in a hotel. (B) She forgot to set her alarm clock.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Forgetting to set the alarm clock is a more plausible cause of oversleeping than staying in a hotel, as it is a common mistake that many people make. Staying in a hotel may also lead to oversleeping, but it is not as likely as forgetting to set the alarm."}}
{"Q": "The man put on sunscreen. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He sat in the shade. (B) He went to the beach.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man put on sunscreen because he went to the beach. Sunscreen is typically used to protect the skin from the sun's harmful UV rays, which are more intense at the beach due to the reflection of the sun off the water and sand. Sitting in the shade may provide some protection from the sun, but it is unlikely that someone would apply sunscreen solely for that reason."}}
{"Q": "The researchers proved the theory. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The researchers retracted the theory. (B) Individuals accepted the theory.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Individuals accepted the theory.\nExplanation: If the researchers proved the theory, it means that they provided evidence or data to support it. Therefore, it is more likely that individuals would accept the theory rather than the researchers retracting it."}}
{"Q": "The fans at the game booed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The game went into overtime. (B) The referee made a bad call.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the referee made a bad call, as this is a common reason for fans to boo at a game. Overtime alone would not necessarily cause booing, as it could be seen as an exciting opportunity for the teams to continue playing."}}
{"Q": "I entered my combination on the lock. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I shut the lock. (B) The lock popped open.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The lock popped open.\nExplanation: If the correct combination was entered, the lock should open, not shut. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The crowd intensified. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The father handed his son some money. (B) The father grabbed his son's hand.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The father grabbed his son's hand.\nExplanation: As the crowd intensified, it is likely that the father would want to ensure the safety of his son by holding his hand and keeping him close. Handing him money would not be a logical response to a growing crowd."}}
{"Q": "The snow was blocking the driveway. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I gathered the snow into a snowball. (B) I shoveled the snow out of the way.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I shoveled the snow out of the way.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the person would shovel the snow out of the way in order to clear the driveway and be able to drive through it, rather than gathering the snow into a snowball which would not solve the problem."}}
{"Q": "The kayakers paddled their oars. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The kayak reached the shore. (B) The kayak hit a wave.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The kayak moved forward.\nExplanation: When the kayakers paddle their oars, it propels the kayak forward through the water. It is not specified in the sentence whether they reached the shore or hit a wave, so those options cannot be assumed as the result of paddling their oars."}}
{"Q": "The girl lost control of her bike. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She let go of the handlebars. (B) She crashed into a fence.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She crashed into a fence.\nExplanation: If the girl lost control of her bike, it is more likely that she would crash into something rather than simply letting go of the handlebars. Crashing into a fence is a common outcome of losing control of a bike."}}
{"Q": "I turned on the fan. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Water sprinkled onto my skin. (B) I felt cool air pass over me.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I felt cool air pass over me.\nExplanation: When you turn on a fan, it circulates the air in the room and creates a breeze that can make you feel cooler. Water sprinkling onto your skin is not a typical result of turning on a fan, so option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The surfers returned to the beach. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They were drenched. (B) They saw a shark.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They saw a shark.\nExplanation: Seeing a shark is a more plausible reason for surfers to return to the beach as it poses a potential threat to their safety. Being drenched is a common occurrence while surfing and would not necessarily cause them to abruptly end their session."}}
{"Q": "I pulled the drain plug in the bathtub. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The water drained out of the tub. (B) The water splashed onto the floor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The water drained out of the tub.\nExplanation: When the drain plug is pulled in a bathtub, it creates an opening for the water to flow out of the tub and into the drain. This is the intended function of the drain plug, and it is unlikely that the water would splash onto the floor unless there was a blockage in the drain or some other issue with the plumbing. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The husband felt guilty about cheating on his wife. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He accused her of infidelity. (B) He confessed his infidelity to her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He confessed his infidelity to her.\nExplanation: Feeling guilty about cheating often leads to confessing the infidelity to the partner. It is a way of seeking forgiveness and trying to make amends for the mistake. Accusing the partner of infidelity would only worsen the situation and create more problems in the relationship. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The ink on the poster smeared. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I waited for the ink to dry. (B) I spilled water on the poster.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible cause of the ink smearing on the poster is that water was spilled on it. Ink is water-soluble, meaning that it can easily be smudged or smeared if it comes into contact with water. Waiting for the ink to dry would not cause it to smear, as long as it was given enough time to fully dry."}}
{"Q": "The child woke up screaming. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He had a nightmare. (B) He wet the bed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He had a nightmare.\nExplanation: Waking up screaming is a common symptom of having a nightmare. It is unlikely that wetting the bed would cause a child to wake up screaming."}}
{"Q": "The boy put his feet up on the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His father sat down at the table. (B) His father lectured him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His father lectured him.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the boy's father would scold or lecture him for putting his feet up on the table, rather than sitting down at the table himself. It is considered impolite and disrespectful to put one's feet on the table, especially in a formal setting. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the father would reprimand the boy for his behavior."}}
{"Q": "My friend turned his head in my direction. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I shouted his name. (B) I waved my arms.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If the friend turned his head in the direction of the speaker, it is more likely that the speaker shouted his name to get his attention rather than waving his arms. Shouting someone's name is a more common way to get someone's attention than waving arms."}}
{"Q": "The government oppressed its citizens. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The citizens staged a revolt. (B) The citizens registered to vote.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The citizens staged a revolt.\nExplanation: When a government oppresses its citizens, it often leads to frustration, anger, and a desire for change. In extreme cases, citizens may feel that they have no other option but to take up arms and revolt against their oppressors. This has been seen throughout history in various countries and regions, such as the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Arab Spring. While registering to vote may be a peaceful way to bring about change, it is unlikely to be the first response of citizens who are being oppressed."}}
{"Q": "The boy was lost in the woods. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He pitched a tent. (B) He screamed for help.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He screamed for help.\nExplanation: If the boy was lost in the woods, it is unlikely that he would immediately pitch a tent. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that he would scream for help in order to try and get someone's attention and find his way out of the woods."}}
{"Q": "The woman travelled abroad. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She wanted to learn how to draw. (B) She wanted to learn about other cultures.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that the woman travelled abroad to learn about other cultures. This is because travelling to other countries is a common way to experience and learn about different cultures, whereas learning how to draw would not necessarily require travelling abroad."}}
{"Q": "The man was jealous of his coworker. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His coworker got a promotion. (B) His coworker worked late.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His coworker got a promotion.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the man was jealous of his coworker because he got a promotion, which could mean a higher salary, more responsibilities, and a higher status within the company. Working late may not necessarily be a cause for jealousy, as it could simply mean that the coworker is dedicated to their job or has a heavier workload."}}
{"Q": "The man witnessed aliens. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was hallucinating. (B) He was meditating.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Hallucinations are a more plausible explanation for witnessing aliens than meditating, as there is no scientific evidence to suggest that meditation can lead to encounters with extraterrestrial beings. On the other hand, hallucinations can be caused by a variety of factors such as drug use, mental illness, or even sleep deprivation. Therefore, it is more likely that the man was experiencing a hallucination rather than having a genuine encounter with aliens."}}
{"Q": "The man's hair turned blonde. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He put bleach in it. (B) He put shampoo in it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He put bleach in it.\nExplanation: Bleach is a common chemical used to lighten hair color, while shampoo does not have the ability to change hair color. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man's hair turned blonde due to the use of bleach."}}
{"Q": "The artist created new work. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She critiqued her previous work. (B) She felt a stroke of inspiration.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She felt a stroke of inspiration.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the artist felt inspired to create new work. While it is possible that she critiqued her previous work and felt the need to improve upon it, this is not necessarily a guarantee that she would create new work. On the other hand, feeling a stroke of inspiration is a common reason for artists to create new work, as it often leads to a burst of creativity and motivation."}}
{"Q": "The son moved away from home. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was discharged from the military. (B) He was going to college.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that the son moved away from home to go to college. This is a common reason for young adults to leave their parents' home and start living independently. Being discharged from the military is also a possibility, but it is less likely as it would depend on whether or not the son had joined the military in the first place."}}
{"Q": "Books fell out of the bookcase. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The shelves were covered with dust. (B) An earthquake shook the bookcase.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) An earthquake shook the bookcase.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that an earthquake caused the books to fall out of the bookcase rather than the shelves being covered with dust. Dust on the shelves would not have enough force to cause the books to fall out, whereas an earthquake can shake the bookcase and cause the books to fall."}}
{"Q": "The electricity in my house shut off. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I turned on a light. (B) I reset the circuit breaker.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I reset the circuit breaker.\nExplanation: If the electricity in the house shut off, it is likely that a circuit breaker tripped. Resetting the circuit breaker would restore power to the house. Turning on a light would not be possible if there is no electricity."}}
{"Q": "We rode the roller coaster. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It looked scary. (B) It looked fun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It looked fun.\nExplanation: The reason for riding the roller coaster was that it looked fun. Roller coasters are designed to provide an exciting and thrilling experience, and many people enjoy the adrenaline rush that comes with riding them. While some people may find roller coasters scary, the fact that the person in the question rode it suggests that they found it appealing and enjoyable. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The bag of popcorn began to pop. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I poured butter into the bag. (B) I heated it in the microwave.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible cause of the popcorn beginning to pop is heating it in the microwave. Popcorn kernels pop when they are exposed to heat, and microwaving is a common method of popping popcorn. Pouring butter into the bag would not cause the popcorn to pop, but rather would add flavor after it has already popped."}}
{"Q": "A tree fell on the power line. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The electricity in the neighborhood went out. (B) The forecast predicted heavy winds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The electricity in the neighborhood went out.\nExplanation: When a tree falls on a power line, it can cause a power outage in the surrounding area. The weight of the tree can damage the power line, causing it to break or disconnect from the power source. This would result in a loss of electricity for the neighborhood. Option B, predicting heavy winds, is not a direct result of a tree falling on a power line."}}
{"Q": "The speaker made politically incorrect comments. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bored the audience. (B) He offended the audience.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He offended the audience.\nExplanation: Making politically incorrect comments can often lead to offending people, especially if the comments are insensitive or discriminatory. It is unlikely that the audience would be bored by such comments, as they would likely elicit a strong reaction. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I pricked myself with the pin. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A bead of sweat dripped from my face. (B) A drop of blood formed on my finger.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. A drop of blood formed on my finger.\nExplanation: When someone pricks themselves with a pin, it is likely that a small wound is created, causing a drop of blood to form on the finger. Sweating is not a common physiological response to a pin prick, making option A less plausible."}}
{"Q": "The fish floated on the surface of the tank. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was hungry. (B) It was dead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the fish is dead. When fish die, they often float to the surface of the water due to the gases that build up in their body. Hunger would not cause a fish to float on the surface."}}
{"Q": "The man's voice sounded hoarse. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He had a cold. (B) He quit smoking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He had a cold.\nExplanation: A hoarse voice is a common symptom of a cold or upper respiratory infection. Quitting smoking may also cause a hoarse voice, but it is less likely to be the cause in this scenario as it is not mentioned that the man was a smoker. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The elevator doors opened. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The elevator arrived at the designated floor. (B) The elevator got stuck between floors.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The elevator arrived at the designated floor.\nExplanation: When the elevator doors open, it is usually an indication that the elevator has arrived at the designated floor. If the elevator got stuck between floors, the doors would not open until the elevator was fixed or manually opened by maintenance personnel. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The teenager snuck out of the house. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He lied to his parents. (B) His parents grounded him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His parents grounded him.\nExplanation: If the teenager was grounded by his parents, it is possible that he snuck out of the house to avoid punishment or to rebel against their authority. On the other hand, if he lied to his parents, there could be various reasons for doing so, but it does not necessarily lead to sneaking out of the house. Therefore, option (B) seems to be a more plausible cause for the teenager's behavior."}}
{"Q": "The bathroom flooded. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The toilet overflowed. (B) The water heater broke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The toilet overflowed.\nExplanation: The toilet overflowing is a more common cause of bathroom flooding than a water heater breaking. Additionally, toilets are designed to prevent overflow, but they can become clogged or malfunction, leading to water spilling onto the bathroom floor. A water heater breaking would likely cause flooding in other areas of the house, not just the bathroom."}}
{"Q": "The puppy stayed near its owner. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The owner put a collar on the puppy. (B) The owner kept the puppy on a leash.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The owner kept the puppy on a leash.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the owner kept the puppy on a leash, which is a common way to keep a puppy close and under control. While a collar may help identify the puppy and keep it from running away, it does not necessarily keep the puppy close to the owner. Therefore, option (B) is a more likely cause for the puppy staying near its owner."}}
{"Q": "The man caught his reflection. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He stood under the sprawling tree. (B) He stood over the calm lake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The man caught his reflection because he stood over the calm lake, which acted as a mirror and reflected his image back to him. It is more plausible than standing under a sprawling tree, which would not provide a reflective surface for him to see his reflection."}}
{"Q": "I missed my girlfriend's phone call. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I called her back. (B) I met her for dinner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Since the question states that the person missed their girlfriend's phone call, the most plausible answer would be to call her back. Meeting her for dinner is not necessarily a direct consequence of missing a phone call."}}
{"Q": "The family searched the neighborhood. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their dog ran away from home. (B) Expensive jewelry was missing from their home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Their dog ran away from home.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions \"the family searched the neighborhood,\" which suggests that they were looking for something or someone. The most likely reason for a family to search their neighborhood is if their pet, in this case, their dog, has run away from home. The missing jewelry from their home is not mentioned in the sentence and is therefore an unlikely cause for the family's search."}}
{"Q": "I saw my breath when I exhaled. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather was chilly. (B) My chest felt tight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: When we exhale, we release warm, moist air from our lungs. If the surrounding air is cold enough, the moisture in our breath condenses into visible droplets, creating the effect of seeing our breath. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the weather was chilly. Option B, chest tightness, is not related to the phenomenon of seeing one's breath."}}
{"Q": "The employees formed a union. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They wanted better working conditions. (B) Their employer raised their wages.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They wanted better working conditions.\nExplanation: The formation of a union by employees is usually a response to poor working conditions, low wages, lack of benefits, or other grievances against their employer. While a wage increase may be a factor in their decision to unionize, it is more likely that the employees were seeking improvements in their overall working conditions."}}
{"Q": "I baked an apple pie. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A rotting smell filled the kitchen. (B) A warm aroma filled the kitchen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. A warm aroma filled the kitchen.\nExplanation: When you bake an apple pie, the heat causes the spices and sugars in the filling to release their aroma, creating a warm and inviting smell in the kitchen. A rotting smell would not be expected unless the apples used in the pie were already spoiled."}}
{"Q": "The woman struggled to walk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She wore high heels. (B) She took off her shoes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She wore high heels.\nExplanation: High heels can cause discomfort and pain in the feet, ankles, and legs, making it difficult to walk. The woman's struggle to walk is likely due to the discomfort caused by the high heels she was wearing. Taking off her shoes (option B) would actually alleviate the discomfort and make it easier for her to walk."}}
{"Q": "Steam rose off of the pot of water. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The water boiled. (B) I covered the pot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The water boiled.\nExplanation: When water reaches its boiling point, it turns into steam and rises off the surface of the water. This is a natural process that occurs when heat is applied to water, causing the molecules to move faster and eventually turn into gas. Covering the pot may trap some of the steam inside, but it does not cause the steam to form in the first place. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "All my socks were in the laundry. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wore sandals. (B) I wore boots.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I wore sandals.\nExplanation: If all of the socks were in the laundry, it is more likely that the person would choose to wear sandals rather than boots, as sandals do not require socks."}}
{"Q": "The politician's argument was considered absurd. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He lost the support of voters. (B) He was accused of corruption.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He lost the support of voters.\nExplanation: If the politician's argument was considered absurd, it is likely that voters would lose faith in his ability to make sound decisions and represent their interests. This could lead to a loss of support and ultimately impact his chances of winning an election. Accusations of corruption would require more evidence and investigation, and cannot be assumed based solely on an absurd argument."}}
{"Q": "Everyone disapproved of the couple's engagement. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The couple got pregnant. (B) The couple eloped.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The couple eloped.\nExplanation: Since everyone disapproved of their engagement, it is likely that the couple faced opposition from their families and friends. In such a situation, eloping is a more plausible option as it allows the couple to get married without the approval of their loved ones. Getting pregnant is not a logical consequence of disapproval of engagement."}}
{"Q": "The building was dedicated to the millionaire. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The millionaire wanted the building torn down. (B) The millionaire contributed the funds to build it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The millionaire contributed the funds to build it.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a building would be dedicated to someone who contributed the funds to build it rather than someone who wanted it torn down. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The sale associate accused the girl of stealing. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sales associate saw the girl put merchandise in her purse. (B) The sales associate helped the girl find the purse she liked.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The cause of the sales associate accusing the girl of stealing was that the sales associate saw the girl put merchandise in her purse. This is a more plausible answer as it provides a clear reason for the accusation. Option B does not provide any reason for the accusation."}}
{"Q": "The country declared war on the neighboring territory. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Soldiers were sent out to fight. (B) Soldiers were reunited with their families.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Soldiers were sent out to fight.\nExplanation: When a country declares war on another territory, it means that they are officially in a state of armed conflict. In such a situation, soldiers are usually sent out to fight against the enemy forces. It is unlikely that soldiers would be reunited with their families during a war as they would be needed on the front lines to defend their country."}}
{"Q": "The court upheld the controversial ruling. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A riot broke loose in front of the courthouse. (B) A couple exchanged vows in front of the courthouse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the above.\nExplanation: The question does not provide enough information to determine what happened as a result of the court upholding the controversial ruling. It is possible that nothing happened or that a variety of different reactions occurred."}}
{"Q": "The girl smelled something burning. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She took the cookies out of the jar. (B) She left the cookies in the oven.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the girl smelled something burning, it is more likely that she left the cookies in the oven for too long and they burned, rather than simply taking them out of the jar."}}
{"Q": "The rain was pouring down. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The storm worsened. (B) I dashed to get inside.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I dashed to get inside.\nExplanation: When it is raining heavily, it is natural for people to seek shelter. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person in the scenario would try to get inside rather than the storm worsening."}}
{"Q": "The building was evacuated. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The elevator stopped functioning. (B) The fire alarm went off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The fire alarm went off.\nExplanation: If the building was evacuated, it is more likely that the cause was a fire alarm going off rather than an elevator malfunctioning. Fire alarms are designed to alert people to evacuate in case of a fire, while elevator malfunctions usually do not require immediate evacuation of the entire building."}}
{"Q": "The father resented his son's alcoholism. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The father bought his son a beer. (B) The father kicked his son out of the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The father kicked his son out of the house.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the father would react negatively to his son's alcoholism and take action to address the issue, rather than enabling it by buying him a beer. Kicking his son out of the house may be a drastic measure, but it could be a way for the father to show his disapproval and encourage his son to seek help for his addiction."}}
{"Q": "The lawyer took the stairs up to her office. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The secretary went home for the day. (B) The elevator was out of order.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the elevator was out of order, as this would be a common reason for someone to take the stairs instead. The fact that the secretary went home for the day is not necessarily related to the lawyer's decision to take the stairs."}}
{"Q": "The man became annoyed with his friend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His friend interrupted him. (B) His friend bought him lunch.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His friend interrupted him.\nExplanation: The word \"annoyed\" suggests a negative emotion, and being interrupted can be a common cause of annoyance in social situations. On the other hand, buying someone lunch is usually seen as a kind gesture, so it is less likely to be the cause of annoyance."}}
{"Q": "The girl handed her money to the cashier. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cashier gave the girl her change. (B) The cashier forgot to give the girl a receipt.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The cashier gave the girl her change.\nExplanation: When someone hands money to a cashier, it is expected that the cashier will give them their change. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cashier gave the girl her change rather than forgetting to give her a receipt."}}
{"Q": "The woman was put in a wheelchair. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was paralyzed in an accident. (B) She entered the hospital in a stretcher.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She was paralyzed in an accident.\nExplanation: The most likely reason for someone to be put in a wheelchair is if they are unable to walk due to paralysis or some other physical disability. Option A states that the woman was paralyzed in an accident, which is a common cause for someone to require a wheelchair. Option B, on the other hand, only states that she entered the hospital in a stretcher, which does not necessarily mean she would need a wheelchair."}}
{"Q": "Citizens hung the national flag up outside their homes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The country was commemorating its independence. (B) The country was facing economic hardship.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The country was commemorating its independence.\nExplanation: Hanging the national flag outside homes is a common way of showing patriotism and celebrating national events such as Independence Day. It is unlikely that citizens would hang the flag outside their homes in response to economic hardship. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The team lost the tournament. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They disappointed their fans. (B) They inspired their fans.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They disappointed their fans.\nExplanation: Losing a tournament is generally seen as a negative outcome, and it is likely that the team's fans were disappointed by the loss. While it is possible that the team's effort and performance could have inspired some fans, it is more likely that the disappointment of losing would have overshadowed any positive feelings."}}
{"Q": "My friend pointed out that I had food stuck in my teeth. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I felt embarrassed. (B) I felt proud.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I felt embarrassed.\nExplanation: It is natural to feel embarrassed when someone points out a flaw or mistake in our appearance. Having food stuck in our teeth is considered a social faux pas, and being made aware of it can cause us to feel self-conscious and embarrassed. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy failed his history exam. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He paid attention in class. (B) He forgot to study.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He forgot to study.\nExplanation: Since the boy failed his history exam, it is more plausible that he did not study enough or at all, rather than paying attention in class. Paying attention in class is important, but it does not guarantee success on an exam if the student does not review and study the material."}}
{"Q": "The downtown building collapsed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An earthquake hit the city. (B) Crime rates in the city increased.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: An earthquake is a natural disaster that can cause buildings to collapse, while crime rates increasing would not directly lead to a building collapsing. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man's girlfriend broke up with him. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He begged her to take him back. (B) She introduced him to her parents.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man would try to win his girlfriend back by begging her to take him back after a breakup rather than her introducing him to her parents. Introducing someone to parents is usually a sign of a serious and committed relationship, which is unlikely to happen after a breakup."}}
{"Q": "The two children simultaneously reached down to retrieve the ball. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The ball rolled away. (B) Their heads collided.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The ball rolled away.\nExplanation: Since both children reached down to retrieve the ball at the same time, it is more likely that the ball would roll away from them rather than their heads colliding. This is a common scenario in which two people reach for the same object at the same time."}}
{"Q": "The raccoon ransacked the garbage can. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was cardboard in the garbage can. (B) The lid was off the garbage can.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the lid was off the garbage can, as raccoons are known for their ability to open lids and access the contents inside. While cardboard may be an attractant for raccoons, it alone would not necessarily cause the ransacking of a garbage can."}}
{"Q": "The boy sharpened the pencil. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was cheap. (B) It was dull.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It was dull.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the pencil was dull, as this is the most common reason for sharpening a pencil. If the pencil was cheap, it wouldn't necessarily need to be sharpened, and even if it was expensive, it wouldn't need to be sharpened unless it was dull. Therefore, (B) is the most likely cause for the boy sharpening the pencil."}}
{"Q": "The cashier denied the woman a refund for the dress. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She lost her receipt. (B) The dress didn't fit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) She lost her receipt.\nExplanation: Without a receipt, it is difficult for the cashier to verify the purchase and process a refund. It is common practice for stores to require a receipt as proof of purchase for returns or refunds. On the other hand, if the dress didn't fit, the store may have a policy to allow returns or exchanges for items that don't fit properly. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible reason for the cashier to deny the refund."}}
{"Q": "The scratch in my skin was deep. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It healed quickly. (B) It left a scar.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It left a scar.\nExplanation: A deep scratch in the skin is likely to cause damage to the underlying tissues, which can result in scarring. Scarring occurs when the body produces collagen fibers to repair the damaged tissue, and these fibers can create a visible mark on the skin. While the healing process may take some time, the scar is likely to remain even after the wound has fully healed. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man received strange looks from passengers on the train. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was staring at the ground. (B) He was talking to himself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The man received strange looks from passengers on the train because he was talking to himself, which is considered unusual behavior in public. Staring at the ground is a common behavior and would not necessarily attract attention or strange looks from others."}}
{"Q": "The child left crumbs on the floor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ants crawled to the crumbs. (B) The child put the bread away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Ants crawled to the crumbs.\nExplanation: It is more likely that leaving crumbs on the floor would attract ants, rather than the child putting the bread away having any significant impact on the situation. Ants are known to be attracted to food crumbs and would likely come to the area to scavenge for food."}}
{"Q": "The woman handed her sister a tissue. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The woman's sister folded her hands. (B) The woman's sister began to cry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The woman's sister began to cry.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the woman's sister began to cry, which prompted the woman to hand her a tissue. If the sister had simply folded her hands, there would be no immediate need for a tissue."}}
{"Q": "The man took a mint. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His lips were chapped. (B) He worried about bad breath.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He worried about bad breath.\nExplanation: Taking a mint is a common solution for bad breath, while chapped lips would not necessarily be relieved by a mint. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The couple left early for the show. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They anticipated traffic around the theatre. (B) They got directions to the theatre.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They anticipated traffic around the theatre.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the couple left early for the show, which implies that they wanted to avoid any potential delays or obstacles that could make them late. Anticipating traffic around the theatre is a common reason for leaving early, especially if the show is popular or there are other events happening in the area. Getting directions to the theatre would not necessarily require them to leave early, as they could have done so at any time before the show."}}
{"Q": "The woman stayed home from work. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her boss praised her. (B) Her coworker covered for her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Her coworker covered for her.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that if the woman stayed home from work, her coworker would cover for her rather than her boss praising her. It is common for coworkers to help each other out in the workplace, especially if someone is absent."}}
{"Q": "The man signed the activists' petition. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He supported their cause. (B) He denounced them as crazy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He supported their cause.\nExplanation: The fact that the man signed the activists' petition suggests that he agrees with their cause and wants to support it. If he denounced them as crazy, he would not have signed the petition. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The actor's heart was fluttering before his performance. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He had stage fright. (B) He memorized his lines.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He had stage fright.\nExplanation: Stage fright is a common phenomenon experienced by actors before a performance. It is characterized by symptoms such as increased heart rate, sweating, and nervousness. Memorizing lines, on the other hand, is a necessary part of an actor's preparation and is unlikely to cause physical symptoms such as a fluttering heart. Therefore, it is more plausible that the actor's heart was fluttering due to stage fright."}}
{"Q": "I was lost. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I counted my cash. (B) I unfolded a map.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I unfolded a map.\nExplanation: If someone is lost, it is more likely that they would try to find their way by using a map rather than counting their cash. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The ripe fruit lingered in the sun. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was eaten. (B) It shriveled up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It shriveled up.\nExplanation: When ripe fruit is left in the sun for too long, it can become dehydrated and lose its moisture, causing it to shrivel up and become unappetizing. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The car broke down. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I turned the ignition. (B) The engine overheated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The engine overheated.\nExplanation: The car breaking down is more likely to be caused by the engine overheating rather than simply turning the ignition. When the engine overheats, it can cause damage to various components and ultimately lead to the car breaking down."}}
{"Q": "The man hurt his back. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He went to see a psychiatrist. (B) He stayed in bed for several days.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He stayed in bed for several days.\nExplanation: If the man hurt his back, it is more likely that he would need to rest and recover, which would require him to stay in bed for several days. Seeing a psychiatrist would not be a typical response to a physical injury."}}
{"Q": "I started a fire in the fireplace. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was out of firewood. (B) It was cold in the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It was cold in the house.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for starting a fire in the fireplace is to warm up the house, especially if it is cold outside. Being out of firewood would not be a reason to start a fire, as there are other ways to heat the house."}}
{"Q": "The woman stopped jogging. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She got a cramp in her side. (B) She got a second wind.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She got a cramp in her side.\nExplanation: Getting a cramp in the side is a common occurrence during exercise, especially while jogging. It can cause discomfort and pain, making it difficult to continue jogging. On the other hand, getting a second wind means feeling a sudden burst of energy and being able to continue exercising with ease, which is less likely to cause someone to stop jogging. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I knocked on my neighbor's door. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My neighbor invited me in. (B) My neighbor left her house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My neighbor invited me in.\nExplanation: It is more likely that if you knocked on your neighbor's door, they would invite you in rather than leaving their house. Knocking on someone's door is usually a sign of wanting to talk or visit with them, and it is common for neighbors to invite each other in for a chat or a cup of coffee."}}
{"Q": "The woman sighed with frustration. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her husband misunderstood her concerns. (B) Her husband kissed her goodbye.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her husband misunderstood her concerns.\nExplanation: The use of the word \"frustration\" suggests that the woman is feeling upset or annoyed about something. Option A provides a plausible reason for this, as a misunderstanding between spouses can often lead to frustration. Option B, on the other hand, does not seem like a likely cause for frustration."}}
{"Q": "The teacher commended the student. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The student answered the question correctly. (B) The student hesitated to answer the question.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The student answered the question correctly.\nExplanation: The word \"commended\" means to praise or express approval. Therefore, it is more likely that the teacher commended the student for answering the question correctly rather than hesitating to answer it."}}
{"Q": "The woman ran out of eggs. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She went to the farm. (B) She went to the supermarket.", "R": {"text": "Answer: She went to the supermarket.\nExplanation: Going to the farm to get eggs would be a less likely option as it would take more time and effort. The woman would most likely go to the nearest supermarket to buy eggs."}}
{"Q": "I encountered an old friend. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I revealed a secret to him. (B) I gave him a hug.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I gave him a hug.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that upon encountering an old friend, one would greet them with a hug rather than revealing a secret to them. Hugging is a common way to show affection and reconnect with someone you haven't seen in a while. Revealing a secret, on the other hand, would depend on the nature of the secret and the relationship between the two friends."}}
{"Q": "The woman avoided going in the lake. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She caught a fish. (B) It looked contaminated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It looked contaminated.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the woman avoided going in the lake because it looked contaminated. This suggests that the woman may have seen something in or around the lake that made her believe it was not safe to swim in. It is unlikely that catching a fish would cause her to avoid the lake altogether."}}
{"Q": "The student arrived to class soaking wet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His umbrella was broken. (B) His bike was stolen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His umbrella was broken.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the student got wet due to a broken umbrella as it would have been raining outside. On the other hand, a stolen bike would not necessarily result in the student being wet."}}
{"Q": "The cursor on the computer screen moved. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The user clicked the mouse. (B) The user shifted the mouse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The user clicked the mouse.\nExplanation: When the user clicks the mouse, it sends a signal to the computer to move the cursor on the screen. Shifting the mouse without clicking it would not cause the cursor to move. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The driver took a detour. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An accident occurred on the main road. (B) She followed the truck in front of her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) An accident occurred on the main road.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as accidents on the main road can cause traffic congestion and delays, prompting drivers to take detours to avoid the traffic. Following a truck in front of her may not necessarily lead to a detour, as the truck may still be on the main road."}}
{"Q": "I hung the wet linen on the outdoor clothesline. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The linen dried. (B) The linen stained.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The linen dried.\nExplanation: When wet linen is hung on a clothesline, it is exposed to the sun and wind, which helps to evaporate the moisture and dry the fabric. Staining is not a likely outcome unless the clothesline is dirty or the linen is in contact with something that could cause a stain. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman put on her shades. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sunlight was bright. (B) She hailed a cab.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The sunlight was bright.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for someone to put on shades is to protect their eyes from the bright sunlight. Hailing a cab does not require wearing shades, so option B is not a likely cause."}}
{"Q": "The man gazed at the night sky. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wished it were summer. (B) He thought it was beautiful.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He thought it was beautiful.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the man \"gazed\" at the night sky, which implies that he was looking at it for a prolonged period of time. Additionally, the use of the word \"gazed\" suggests that he was admiring or appreciating the sky. Therefore, it is more likely that the man was gazing at the night sky because he thought it was beautiful, rather than because he wished it were summer."}}
{"Q": "I felt exhausted. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I went to bed early. (B) I stayed up all night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I went to bed early.\nExplanation: When feeling exhausted, the most plausible response would be to rest and recharge by getting a good night's sleep. Staying up all night would only exacerbate the exhaustion and lead to further fatigue. Therefore, going to bed early is the more logical choice."}}
{"Q": "The man went to the barber. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was growing out his hair. (B) His hair was getting long.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His hair was getting long.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that the man went to the barber, which implies that he needed a haircut. Option (B) states that his hair was getting long, which is a common reason for visiting a barber. Option (A) suggests that the man was intentionally growing out his hair, which may not necessarily require a visit to the barber. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy played mean tricks on his new classmate. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boy welcomed the new classmate. (B) The boy disliked the new classmate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The boy disliked the new classmate.\nExplanation: The fact that the boy played mean tricks on his new classmate suggests that he had negative feelings towards him. If he had welcomed the new classmate, he would have been friendly and kind instead of playing mean tricks. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I craved a glass of milk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was eating cookies. (B) I was baking bread.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I was eating cookies.\nExplanation: Milk is often paired with cookies, so it is more likely that the craving for milk was caused by eating cookies rather than baking bread."}}
{"Q": "It began to rain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The driver turned on the headlights. (B) The driver shifted the car into reverse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The driver turned on the headlights.\nExplanation: When it starts to rain, visibility on the road decreases. Therefore, it is important to turn on the headlights to increase visibility and ensure safety while driving. Shifting the car into reverse is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the situation of rain."}}
{"Q": "The parking lot of the building was empty. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I parked across the street. (B) I parked near the entrance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Since the parking lot was empty, it would be more likely that the person would park closer to the building rather than far away across the street. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The writer missed her deadline for the draft submission. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She had writer's block. (B) She edited the draft.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that the writer edited the draft suggests that she was actively working on it, but perhaps spent too much time revising and refining it, causing her to miss the deadline. Writer's block, on the other hand, would imply that she was unable to make any progress on the draft at all."}}
{"Q": "The associate hung up on me. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I asked to speak to a supervisor. (B) I provided my identification number.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I asked to speak to a supervisor.\nExplanation: It is possible that the associate became frustrated or felt unable to handle the situation when the customer requested to speak to a supervisor. This could have led to them hanging up on the customer."}}
{"Q": "The wind blew through the open window. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doorbell rang. (B) The curtains shuddered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The curtains shuddered.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the wind blowing through the open window would cause the curtains to move or shudder rather than the doorbell ringing."}}
{"Q": "The electricity in my house shut off. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I unplugged the lamp. (B) I blew a fuse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I blew a fuse.\nExplanation: If the electricity in the entire house shut off, it is more likely that a fuse was blown rather than just one lamp being unplugged. A blown fuse can occur due to overloading the circuit or a short circuit. It is recommended to check the fuse box and replace any blown fuses."}}
{"Q": "The weightlifter grunted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He flexed his muscles in the mirror. (B) He lifted the bar over his head.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The weightlifter grunted most likely because he was exerting a lot of effort to lift the bar over his head. Grunting is a common sound made by weightlifters when they are lifting heavy weights as it helps them to breathe out forcefully and stabilize their core muscles. Flexing his muscles in the mirror may not necessarily cause him to grunt."}}
{"Q": "The student tried to do the math in his head. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got out a calculator. (B) He got confused.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the student got confused as doing math in one's head can be challenging and lead to errors or confusion. Getting out a calculator would be less likely as the student may have initially attempted to do the math mentally to save time or because a calculator was not readily available."}}
{"Q": "The baby fell asleep. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The father changed the baby's diaper. (B) The father gently rocked the baby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The father gently rocked the baby.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the baby fell asleep because the father gently rocked the baby. Rocking is a common method used to soothe babies and help them fall asleep. Changing a diaper may have made the baby more comfortable, but it is not necessarily a direct cause of the baby falling asleep."}}
{"Q": "The girl threw the water balloon at the boy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boy got a concussion. (B) The boy got soaked.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The boy got soaked.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy got wet as a result of being hit by a water balloon rather than getting a concussion. Water balloons are typically filled with water and are not heavy enough to cause a concussion. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "The photographer forgot to use the flash on the camera. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The photos turned out blurry. (B) Everyone in the photos refused to smile.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The photos turned out blurry.\nExplanation: Without the flash, the camera would have had to use a slower shutter speed to capture enough light, resulting in blurry photos if the subjects moved even slightly during the exposure. The lack of flash would not have affected the subjects' willingness to smile."}}
{"Q": "I declined the invitation to the birthday party. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was lonely. (B) I was out of town.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I was out of town.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if someone is out of town, they physically cannot attend the birthday party. On the other hand, if someone is feeling lonely, they may actually be more likely to attend a social event like a birthday party."}}
{"Q": "I exercised. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I felt energetic. (B) I was scared.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Feeling energetic is a more plausible cause for exercising than being scared. When someone feels energetic, they are more likely to engage in physical activity, whereas being scared may cause someone to freeze or run away rather than exercise."}}
{"Q": "I squeezed the damp sponge. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It soaked up water. (B) Water seeped out of it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Water seeped out of it.\nExplanation: When a sponge is damp, it is already saturated with water. Squeezing it will cause the excess water to be forced out of the sponge, resulting in water seeping out of it. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The vacationers took a ferry to the resort. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The resort was booked. (B) The resort was on an island.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The resort was on an island.\nExplanation: The fact that the vacationers took a ferry to the resort suggests that the resort was located on an island, which would make it inaccessible by car or other means of transportation. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer. Option (A) is unlikely because if the resort was fully booked, the vacationers would have had to find alternative accommodation, not take a ferry to the resort."}}
{"Q": "The teenager got a tattoo. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was afraid of needles. (B) She wanted to rebel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She wanted to rebel.\nExplanation: Teenagers often get tattoos as a way to express their individuality and rebel against societal norms. It is unlikely that someone who is afraid of needles would voluntarily get a tattoo."}}
{"Q": "An unfamiliar car parked outside my house. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I became suspicious. (B) I called the police.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I became suspicious.\nExplanation: It is natural to become suspicious when an unfamiliar car is parked outside your house. However, calling the police may not be necessary unless there is a clear threat or danger. It is better to observe the situation and gather more information before taking any action."}}
{"Q": "The criminal turned himself in. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The evidence implicated him. (B)  There was no evidence against him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that the criminal turned himself in suggests that there was evidence against him that he knew would lead to his arrest and conviction. If there was no evidence against him, he would have no reason to turn himself in."}}
{"Q": "The heavyset man decided to lose weight. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He cut out sweets. (B) He avoided caffeine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Cutting out sweets is a more plausible answer as sweets are often high in calories and cutting them out can lead to weight loss. Avoiding caffeine may have some health benefits, but it is not directly related to weight loss."}}
{"Q": "The girl stepped on the ice. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She slid. (B) She shivered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She slid.\nExplanation: When someone steps on ice, it is likely that they will slide due to the slippery surface. Shivering may occur if the temperature is very cold, but it is not a direct result of stepping on ice. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman had rings under her eyes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She stayed up all night. (B) She put her son to bed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She stayed up all night.\nExplanation: Rings under the eyes are commonly associated with lack of sleep or fatigue. Option A is a more plausible answer as staying up all night can cause dark circles or bags under the eyes. Option B, putting her son to bed, is not a likely cause for rings under the eyes."}}
{"Q": "Lava flowed from the volcano. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The volcano erupted. (B) The volcano was dormant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The volcano erupted.\nExplanation: Lava is molten rock that is expelled from a volcano during an eruption. Therefore, the most plausible cause of lava flowing from a volcano is that the volcano has erupted. Option B, stating that the volcano was dormant, does not explain the presence of lava."}}
{"Q": "The woman put her shoes on. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She knew everyone at the party. (B) She wanted to leave the party.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the woman wanted to leave the party, as putting on shoes is often a sign of preparing to depart. Knowing everyone at the party does not necessarily require putting on shoes, so option A is less likely."}}
{"Q": "I paid the tollbooth attendant. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She let me pass through the tollbooth. (B) She detained me at the tollbooth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She let me pass through the tollbooth.\nExplanation: It is common practice for tollbooth attendants to collect payment and then allow the driver to pass through the tollbooth. There is no reason to believe that the attendant would detain the driver after payment has been made. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The executive went bankrupt. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He sold his company stock. (B) He squandered his fortune.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the executive squandered his fortune, it would make sense that he went bankrupt. Selling his company stock alone may not necessarily lead to bankruptcy, as it depends on the amount of stock sold and the financial state of the company."}}
{"Q": "The man went to the doctor. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor was on leave. (B) The man felt ill.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man went to the doctor because he felt ill. It is common for people to visit a doctor when they are not feeling well and need medical attention. Option A, that the doctor was on leave, does not provide a reason for the man's visit to the doctor."}}
{"Q": "I exited my bedroom through the window. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The house was on fire. (B) The house was empty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the house was on fire, it would be more logical to exit through the door and follow the emergency evacuation plan. Exiting through the window would be a last resort. However, if the house was empty, there would be no one to open the door for the person or they may have lost their key. In this case, exiting through the window would be a plausible option."}}
{"Q": "The boy's fingers became pruny. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He took a long shower. (B) He lathered his hands with soap.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He took a long shower.\nExplanation: When skin is exposed to water for a prolonged period of time, it can cause the outer layer of skin to absorb water and swell, which can lead to the wrinkling or pruning of the skin on the fingers. This is a common occurrence when someone takes a long shower or bath. Lathering hands with soap alone would not cause this reaction."}}
{"Q": "I spit out the milk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The milk tasted sour. (B) My mouth was dry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The milk tasted sour.\nExplanation: If the milk tasted sour, it would be a natural reaction to spit it out. On the other hand, if the person's mouth was dry, they may have had difficulty swallowing the milk, but it would not necessarily cause them to spit it out. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I missed the bus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was early to work. (B) I was late to work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I was late to work.\nExplanation: If you missed the bus, it means you were not able to catch it on time and had to wait for the next one or find an alternative mode of transportation. This delay would have caused you to arrive at work later than expected, making option B the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The truck collided with the car. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The truck sped up. (B) The car got smashed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The car got smashed.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the car would be damaged or smashed as a result of a collision with a larger vehicle like a truck, rather than the truck speeding up."}}
{"Q": "The team rigged the contest in their favor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They won. (B)  They dropped out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They won.\nExplanation: Since the team rigged the contest in their favor, it is likely that they were able to manipulate the outcome and win the contest. It would not make sense for them to drop out if they had already rigged the contest in their favor."}}
{"Q": "The soda bottle hissed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I turned over the bottle. (B) I twisted off the cap.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The hissing sound from a soda bottle is caused by the release of carbon dioxide gas, which is dissolved in the liquid. This gas is under pressure, and when the cap is twisted off, the pressure is released, causing the hissing sound. Turning over the bottle would not necessarily cause the hissing sound, as the gas would still be under pressure and would not be released until the cap is opened. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy was locked out of his house. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He crawled in through an open window. (B) He climbed up to the roof.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He crawled in through an open window.\nExplanation: Climbing up to the roof is a dangerous and unlikely solution to being locked out of the house. Crawling in through an open window is a more plausible solution, as it is a common way for people to enter their homes when they are locked out."}}
{"Q": "The doorbell rang. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The visitor tapped the knocker on the door. (B) The woman peered through the keyhole in the door.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The visitor tapped the knocker on the door.\nExplanation: The doorbell ringing is usually associated with a button or switch that is pressed outside the door, which would result in a sound being produced inside the house. Therefore, it is more plausible that the visitor tapped the knocker on the door to produce the sound rather than the woman peering through the keyhole in the door."}}
{"Q": "The man stained his suit. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He got it dry-cleaned. (B) He hung it in his closet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: He got it dry-cleaned.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man would get his stained suit dry-cleaned to remove the stain rather than just hanging it in his closet and leaving the stain there. Dry-cleaning is a common method for removing stains from clothing, especially for suits which are often made of delicate fabrics."}}
{"Q": "The girl squeezed the tube of toothpaste. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The toothpaste squirted out of the tube. (B) The girl spit out the toothpaste.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The toothpaste squirted out of the tube.\nExplanation: When you squeeze a tube of toothpaste, the toothpaste inside is forced out of the opening. Therefore, it is more plausible that the toothpaste squirted out of the tube rather than the girl spitting it out."}}
{"Q": "Civilian deaths from the war surged. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Pacifists staged a protest. (B) Pacifists held a parade.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Pacifists staged a protest.\nExplanation: It is more likely that pacifists would stage a protest in response to an increase in civilian deaths from the war, as they are opposed to violence and would want to draw attention to the human cost of war. Holding a parade would not be an appropriate response to such a serious issue."}}
{"Q": "The girl yanked the ribbon out of her hair. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She tied the ribbon. (B) The ribbon looked babyish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The ribbon looked babyish.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the girl yanked the ribbon out of her hair, which implies that she did it forcefully and with intention. The reason given for this action is that the ribbon looked babyish, which is a more plausible explanation than her simply untying a ribbon that she had tied herself."}}
{"Q": "The man got plastic surgery. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He aged. (B) He looked younger.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He looked younger.\nExplanation: Plastic surgery is often done to improve one's appearance and reduce the signs of aging. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man looked younger after getting plastic surgery."}}
{"Q": "A baby chicken emerged from the egg. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The egg hatched. (B) I cracked the egg.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The egg hatched.\nExplanation: When a baby chicken emerges from an egg, it means that the egg has hatched. This is a natural process that occurs when the chick inside the egg has developed enough to break through the shell and come out. Cracking the egg would not result in a live baby chicken emerging, as the embryo inside would not have had the opportunity to fully develop."}}
{"Q": "The prisoner starved. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He died. (B) He fled.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He died.\nExplanation: When a person starves, their body does not receive the necessary nutrients and energy to function properly. Eventually, the body will shut down and the person will die. Therefore, it is more plausible that the prisoner died as a result of starvation. Fleeing would require energy and strength, which the prisoner would not have had if they were starving."}}
{"Q": "The man lost his balance on the ladder. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He climbed up the ladder. (B) He fell off the ladder.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He fell off the ladder.\nExplanation: If the man lost his balance on the ladder, it is more likely that he would fall off the ladder rather than continue climbing up it. Losing balance on a ladder can be dangerous and result in falls, which is why it is important to use ladders safely and properly."}}
{"Q": "The child burped. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He took a swig of soda. (B) He opened the soda can.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He took a swig of soda.\nExplanation: Burping is a common reaction to drinking carbonated beverages, such as soda. Therefore, it is more plausible that the child burped because he took a swig of soda rather than simply opening the can."}}
{"Q": "A cold draft came in through the window. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I relaxed. (B) I shivered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I shivered.\nExplanation: When a cold draft comes in through a window, it lowers the temperature in the room and can cause a person to feel cold. Shivering is a natural response to feeling cold as the body tries to generate heat to warm up. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person would shiver rather than relax in response to a cold draft."}}
{"Q": "The student received a scholarship to go to college. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her classmates respected her. (B) She made good grades.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She made good grades.\nExplanation: Scholarships are typically awarded based on academic merit, such as high grades or test scores. While being respected by classmates may be a positive factor, it is not typically the primary reason for receiving a scholarship."}}
{"Q": "The girl poked fun at the boy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She lived next door to him. (B) She had a crush on him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She had a crush on him.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the girl poked fun at the boy because she had a crush on him. Teasing or making fun of someone is often a way to get their attention or show interest in a playful way. Living next door to someone does not necessarily lead to teasing or poking fun at them."}}
{"Q": "The hungry vagrant stole food. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He incited pity. (B) He had no money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He had no money.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for the vagrant to steal food is that he had no money to buy it. This is a common reason for theft, especially among those who are homeless or living in poverty. While it is possible that the vagrant incited pity, this alone would not necessarily lead to stealing food."}}
{"Q": "I called my friend to chat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I wanted privacy. (B) I felt lonely.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I felt lonely.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for calling a friend to chat is because one is feeling lonely and wants to connect with someone. Privacy may be a factor in some cases, but it is not the most likely reason for calling a friend to chat."}}
{"Q": "The man extended his hand to me. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I shook his hand. (B) I slapped him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I shook his hand.\nExplanation: It is a common social norm to shake hands when someone extends their hand towards you. Slapping someone's hand in this situation would be considered rude and inappropriate. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person shook the man's hand."}}
{"Q": "I ducked. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fireworks launched up in the air. (B) The frisbee soared towards my head.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The frisbee soaring towards the head is a more plausible cause for ducking as it poses a direct threat to the person's safety. Fireworks launched up in the air may be loud and startling, but they do not pose a physical danger to the person."}}
{"Q": "The girl bit her nails. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was worried. (B) She was surprised.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She was worried.\nExplanation: Nail biting is a common habit that is often associated with anxiety, stress, or nervousness. Therefore, it is more plausible that the girl was biting her nails because she was worried about something rather than being surprised."}}
{"Q": "I turned the page on the calendar. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I marked an appointment on the calendar. (B) It was the beginning of a new month.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It was the beginning of a new month.\nExplanation: The turning of the page on a calendar is a common occurrence at the start of a new month. It is unlikely that marking an appointment on the calendar would be the cause of turning the page, as appointments can be marked on any day of the month. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The husband discovered that his wife was having an affair. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He fired his lawyer. (B) He filed for divorce.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He filed for divorce.\nExplanation: Discovering that one's spouse is having an affair is a serious breach of trust and can often lead to the breakdown of the marriage. Filing for divorce is a common response in such situations. Firing his lawyer would not be a logical or relevant response to this particular situation."}}
{"Q": "The girl dropped the rubber ball. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The ball bounced. (B) The ball glowed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The ball bounced.\nExplanation: When a rubber ball is dropped, it is likely to bounce due to its elasticity. The energy from the impact of the ball hitting the ground is transferred back to the ball, causing it to bounce back up. Therefore, it is more plausible that the ball bounced rather than glowed."}}
{"Q": "The girl made a mistake on her exam. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She guessed at the answer. (B) She erased her answer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: She erased her answer.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the girl would erase her answer if she made a mistake on her exam, rather than guessing at the answer. Erasing the answer would allow her to correct her mistake and provide a more accurate response. Guessing at the answer would not necessarily address the mistake she made."}}
{"Q": "The player tackled his opponent. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His opponent caught the pass. (B) His opponent hit the ground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. His opponent hit the ground.\nExplanation: If the player tackled his opponent, it is likely that the opponent was unable to maintain possession of the ball and fell to the ground. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer. Option A is less likely as it does not necessarily follow that the opponent caught the pass after being tackled."}}
{"Q": "I picked the tomatoes from the vine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were ripe. (B) I watered them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They were ripe.\nExplanation: Tomatoes are typically picked when they are fully ripe and have reached their peak flavor and texture. Watering the tomatoes may help them grow, but it does not necessarily cause them to be ready for picking. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man wanted to act romantic. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He met his ex-girlfriend for lunch. (B) He bought his girlfriend chocolates.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He bought his girlfriend chocolates.\nExplanation: Buying chocolates is a common romantic gesture, especially on occasions like Valentine's Day or anniversaries. Meeting an ex-girlfriend for lunch may not necessarily be a romantic act and could lead to various outcomes, including negative ones. Therefore, option B seems like a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The mercury in the thermometer rose. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I dropped the thermometer. (B) The weather got warmer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The weather got warmer.\nExplanation: The rise in temperature in the thermometer is most likely due to the increase in temperature in the environment, which is caused by the weather getting warmer. Dropping the thermometer would not cause a rise in temperature."}}
{"Q": "A tornado came through the town. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The roof of the courthouse blew off. (B) The highway became dangerously icy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The roof of the courthouse blew off.\nExplanation: Tornadoes are known for their strong winds and ability to cause significant damage to buildings. It is plausible that the courthouse, being a large and prominent building, would be affected by the tornado and have its roof blown off. On the other hand, the highway becoming dangerously icy is not a likely result of a tornado."}}
{"Q": "The student received tutoring. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His grades improved. (B) He cheated on the exam.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His grades improved.\nExplanation: It is common for students to receive tutoring to improve their understanding of a subject and ultimately improve their grades. Cheating on an exam would not be a likely result of receiving tutoring."}}
{"Q": "I felt comfortable. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I kneeled down on the ground. (B) I wrapped myself in a blanket.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I wrapped myself in a blanket.\nExplanation: Wrapping oneself in a blanket can provide warmth and a sense of security, which can lead to feelings of comfort. Kneeling down on the ground may not necessarily lead to feelings of comfort."}}
{"Q": "I polished the stone. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It became slippery. (B) It became shiny.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It became shiny.\nExplanation: When you polish a stone, you use a substance or tool to smooth and buff the surface, which results in a shiny appearance. It does not necessarily become slippery unless a separate substance is applied to it."}}
{"Q": "I added sugar to the coffee. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The coffee smelled strong. (B) The coffee tasted sweet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The coffee tasted sweet.\nExplanation: Adding sugar to coffee would make it taste sweet, as sugar is a sweetener. It would not affect the smell of the coffee. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man shuffled through the papers. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He got a paper cut. (B) He shredded the papers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: None of the above.\nExplanation: The question does not provide enough information to determine what happened as a result of the man shuffling through the papers. It is possible that he found what he was looking for, organized the papers, or simply continued searching. Without further context, it is impossible to determine a specific outcome."}}
{"Q": "I pounded the nail with the hammer. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The nail sunk into the wood. (B) The nail became rusty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The nail sunk into the wood.\nExplanation: When a nail is pounded with a hammer, the force of the hammer drives the nail into the wood, causing it to sink in. Rust is a chemical reaction that occurs over time due to exposure to moisture and oxygen, and is not a direct result of pounding a nail with a hammer. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The fish bit the line. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fisherman reeled in the fish. (B) The fisherman recast the line.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The fisherman reeled in the fish.\nExplanation: If the fish bit the line, it means that the fish is hooked onto the bait. Therefore, the most plausible result would be that the fisherman would reel in the fish. Recasting the line would not make sense as the fish is already hooked onto the bait."}}
{"Q": "The teenager was embarrassed to go to school. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She got a pimple. (B) She got her braces off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She got a pimple.\nExplanation: Getting a pimple is a common occurrence during teenage years and can cause embarrassment, especially if it is in a noticeable area like the face. On the other hand, getting braces off is usually a cause for celebration as it means the person's teeth are now straightened. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer for why the teenager was embarrassed to go to school."}}
{"Q": "My facial expression lit up. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I received good news. (B) I lost my patience.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I received good news.\nExplanation: When someone receives good news, it is common for their facial expression to light up with happiness or excitement. Losing patience, on the other hand, is more likely to result in a frustrated or angry facial expression. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the facial expression lighting up."}}
{"Q": "I wiped my hands with a towel. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The towel was wet. (B) My hands were wet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. My hands were wet.\nExplanation: If the towel was wet, it would not necessarily mean that I would wipe my hands with it. However, if my hands were wet, it would make sense for me to use a towel to dry them off. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man lost his balance on the stool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The stool wobbled underneath him. (B) He spilled paint on the stool.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The stool wobbled underneath him.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the man lost his balance due to the stool wobbling underneath him rather than spilling paint on the stool. Spilling paint on the stool may make it slippery, but it is not as likely to cause the stool to wobble and throw the man off balance."}}
{"Q": "The teammates directed blame at each other. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They lost their game. (B) Their coach cancelled practice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: They lost their game.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the teammates would direct blame at each other after losing a game rather than their coach cancelling practice. Losing a game can be a frustrating and emotional experience, and it is common for teammates to look for someone to blame in such situations. On the other hand, cancelling practice may cause disappointment or inconvenience, but it is less likely to lead to blaming behavior among teammates."}}
{"Q": "I asked for forgiveness. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I regretted my mistake. (B) I achieved my goal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Asking for forgiveness usually implies that one has done something wrong or hurtful to someone else, and therefore regrets their actions. Option B, achieving a goal, does not necessarily have any connection to asking for forgiveness."}}
{"Q": "The woman became bored with her date. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He asked her questions about herself. (B) He talked incessantly about himself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He talked incessantly about himself.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the woman became bored with her date because he talked too much about himself, rather than because he asked her questions about herself. When someone talks excessively about themselves, it can come across as self-centered and uninterested in the other person. On the other hand, asking questions about the other person shows a genuine interest in getting to know them."}}
{"Q": "The girl flashed a smile. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her cheeks reddened. (B) Her dimples showed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Her dimples showed.\nExplanation: When someone flashes a smile, it usually means they are showing their teeth and their facial muscles are relaxed. Dimples are a common feature that appears when someone smiles, so it is more plausible that her dimples showed as a result of her smile. While blushing or reddening of the cheeks can also happen when someone smiles, it is not always the case and may depend on the individual's skin tone and level of shyness."}}
{"Q": "The enemy ship blew up. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It passed over the mine. (B) It sailed into the harbor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It passed over the mine.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the enemy ship blew up because it passed over a mine, which is a common tactic used in naval warfare. Sailing into a harbor alone would not typically cause a ship to explode."}}
{"Q": "The man punctured his foot. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He walked into a puddle. (B) He stepped on broken glass.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He stepped on broken glass.\nExplanation: Stepping on broken glass is a common cause of foot punctures and is more plausible than simply walking into a puddle, which is unlikely to cause a puncture."}}
{"Q": "The detectives dusted the crime scene for fingerprints. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They discovered the identity of the murderer. (B) They found the weapon at the crime scene.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Dusting for fingerprints can help identify potential suspects, but it does not necessarily lead to the discovery of the murder weapon. It is more likely that the detectives were able to match the fingerprints found at the scene to a suspect in their database, leading to the identification of the murderer."}}
{"Q": "There was a lot of traffic on the highway. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I took a detour. (B) I asked for a ride.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I took a detour.\nExplanation: If there was a lot of traffic on the highway, it would make sense to take a detour to avoid the congestion. Asking for a ride would not necessarily solve the problem of traffic on the highway."}}
{"Q": "The nation's economy declined. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Many people got sick. (B) Many people faced unemployment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Many people faced unemployment.\nExplanation: When the economy declines, businesses may struggle to make profits and may have to lay off workers. This can lead to a rise in unemployment rates as many people lose their jobs. It is unlikely that a decline in the economy would directly cause people to get sick, although it may indirectly impact healthcare access and affordability."}}
{"Q": "The crossing guard blew her whistle at the children. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were about to walk into oncoming traffic. (B) She recognized them from her neighborhood.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the crossing guard blew her whistle at the children because they were about to walk into oncoming traffic. This is a common reason for crossing guards to blow their whistles, as their primary job is to ensure the safety of pedestrians crossing the street. It is unlikely that the crossing guard recognized the children from her neighborhood as a reason for blowing her whistle, as this would not be a safety concern."}}
{"Q": "I rolled my eyes at my friend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He told me the truth. (B) He made a sarcastic remark.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He made a sarcastic remark.\nExplanation: Rolling one's eyes is often a nonverbal expression of annoyance or disbelief. In this case, the most plausible reason for rolling one's eyes at a friend would be if they made a sarcastic remark that was perceived as irritating or insincere. While it's possible that the friend told the truth about something that was unpleasant or difficult to hear, this alone wouldn't necessarily warrant an eye roll."}}
{"Q": "The car ran out of gas. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The driver was stranded on the road. (B) The driver picked up a hitchhiker.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The driver was stranded on the road.\nExplanation: When a car runs out of gas, it cannot continue to run. Therefore, the driver would be unable to continue driving and would be stranded on the road until they can obtain more gas. It is unlikely that the driver would pick up a hitchhiker in this situation as they would be focused on finding a way to get more gas and continue their journey."}}
{"Q": "The woman went into labor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The baby was delivered. (B) The woman had morning sickness.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The baby was delivered.\nExplanation: When a woman goes into labor, it means that the process of giving birth has started. Therefore, the most plausible outcome would be that the baby was delivered. Morning sickness is a common symptom during early pregnancy and is not related to labor."}}
{"Q": "The man's hat blew away. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He took off the hat. (B) It was windy outside.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It was windy outside.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that it was windy outside, which caused the man's hat to blow away. If he had taken off the hat, it would not have blown away on its own. Therefore, the wind is the most likely cause of the hat blowing away."}}
{"Q": "The girl attended her classmate's birthday party. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She received an invitation. (B) She bought a gift.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She received an invitation.\nExplanation: The most common reason for attending a birthday party is receiving an invitation. It is not necessary to buy a gift to attend a party, although it is a nice gesture. Therefore, receiving an invitation is a more plausible reason for the girl attending her classmate's birthday party."}}
{"Q": "The boy's forehead felt hot. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His mother took his temperature. (B) His mother took him to the park.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His mother took his temperature.\nExplanation: When a person's forehead feels hot, it is often a sign of a fever. Therefore, it is more plausible that the mother would take the boy's temperature to confirm if he has a fever or not. Taking him to the park would not be a logical response to a potentially sick child."}}
{"Q": "The man sprayed himself with cologne. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He wanted to impress his date. (B) He put gel in his hair.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He wanted to impress his date.\nExplanation: The act of spraying oneself with cologne is often associated with wanting to smell good and make a good impression on others. In this case, the man likely sprayed himself with cologne in order to impress his date. Choice B, putting gel in his hair, is not a likely cause for spraying oneself with cologne."}}
{"Q": "The electricity in the house shut off. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I looked for a flashlight. (B) I picked up a shovel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I looked for a flashlight.\nExplanation: When the electricity shuts off, it becomes dark and difficult to see. Therefore, the most plausible action would be to look for a flashlight to provide light and visibility. Picking up a shovel would not be a logical response to a power outage."}}
{"Q": "The family moved into a bigger house. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The son graduated from high school. (B) The mother gave birth to twins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The mother gave birth to twins.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the family needed a bigger house to accommodate the new additions to the family, rather than the son graduating from high school. Graduating from high school does not necessarily require a family to move into a bigger house, whereas having twins would require more space for the family to live comfortably."}}
{"Q": "The marathoner kept at a slow pace. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She wanted to conserve her energy. (B) She saw the finish line.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She wanted to conserve her energy.\nExplanation: Marathon runners often pace themselves to conserve their energy and avoid burning out too quickly. By maintaining a slower pace, the runner can ensure that they have enough energy to finish the race strong. Seeing the finish line may motivate the runner, but it is unlikely to cause them to slow down their pace."}}
{"Q": "The boy kicked the vending machine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The machine spit out the change. (B) The bag of chips was stuck.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The bag of chips was stuck.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy kicked the vending machine because the bag of chips was stuck and he was frustrated, rather than the machine spitting out the change, which would not typically cause someone to kick the machine."}}
{"Q": "My friend's dog died. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I rolled my eyes at him. (B) I gave him a hug.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I gave him a hug.\nExplanation: It is more plausible to offer comfort and support to a friend who has lost a beloved pet. Rolling one's eyes would be insensitive and inappropriate in this situation. A hug shows empathy and compassion, and can help the friend feel less alone in their grief."}}
{"Q": "The businessman's credit card got declined. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wrote an IOU. (B) He paid with cash.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He paid with cash.\nExplanation: If the businessman's credit card got declined, it means that the transaction could not be completed using the card. Therefore, the most plausible option would be for him to pay with cash instead. Writing an IOU would not be a practical solution as it would require the other party to trust him to pay later, and it may not be a feasible option depending on the circumstances."}}
{"Q": "The man cursed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He clipped his nails. (B) He stubbed his toe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Stubbing one's toe is a common and painful experience that often elicits a curse or exclamation of frustration. Clipping one's nails, on the other hand, is not typically a cause for cursing."}}
{"Q": "The man felt proud of his brother. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His brother got in an argument with their parents. (B) His brother got accepted into law school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His brother got accepted into law school.\nExplanation: Getting accepted into law school is a significant achievement and requires a lot of hard work and dedication. It is a plausible reason for the man to feel proud of his brother. On the other hand, getting into an argument with their parents may not necessarily be a cause for pride."}}
{"Q": "The girl wanted to learn about the solar system. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She went to the library. (B) She looked at the stars.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She went to the library.\nExplanation: Going to the library is a more plausible answer as it is a common place to find books and resources about the solar system. Looking at the stars may be interesting, but it may not provide the detailed information the girl is seeking."}}
{"Q": "The poster stuck to the wall. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I positioned the poster above the door. (B) I put tape on the back of the poster.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the poster was stuck to the wall because tape was put on the back of it. Positioning the poster above the door may have contributed to it staying in place, but it would not have been the sole cause of it sticking to the wall."}}
{"Q": "The client approved the architect's plans for the building. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The architect constructed the building. (B) The architect adjusted the plans.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The architect constructed the building.\nExplanation: If the client approved the architect's plans for the building, it means that the client was satisfied with the design and gave permission for the architect to proceed with construction. Therefore, the architect would have constructed the building according to the approved plans. Option B, where the architect adjusted the plans, would only be applicable if the client requested changes or modifications to the original plans."}}
{"Q": "The man dropped his spoon. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His hand was shaking. (B) He licked the spoon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man's hand was shaking, causing him to drop the spoon. Licking the spoon would not typically cause someone to drop it, whereas hand tremors or weakness could easily lead to an accidental drop."}}
{"Q": "The CEO of the company resigned. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The board of directors dissolved the company. (B) The board of directors found his replacement.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The board of directors found his replacement.\nExplanation: It is highly unlikely that the resignation of the CEO would result in the dissolution of the entire company. The board of directors would likely have a succession plan in place and would immediately begin the process of finding a replacement for the CEO."}}
{"Q": "I arrived late to the lecture. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I took a seat in the back row. (B) I approached the podium.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I took a seat in the back row.\nExplanation: It is more likely that if someone arrives late to a lecture, they would try to find a seat in the back row rather than approaching the podium, which could be disruptive to the speaker and the audience."}}
{"Q": "The man was released from jail. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His family paid his bail. (B) He attacked a fellow inmate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His family paid his bail.\nExplanation: If the man was released from jail, it is more likely that his family paid his bail rather than him attacking a fellow inmate. Attacking a fellow inmate would likely result in additional charges and a longer stay in jail, not release. On the other hand, if his family paid his bail, he would be able to leave jail and await trial or sentencing outside of custody."}}
{"Q": "The family lost all their belongings. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They sold their house. (B) Their house caught fire.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Their house caught fire.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as losing all belongings due to a fire is a common occurrence. Selling a house would not necessarily result in losing all belongings, as they could have moved their possessions to a new home."}}
{"Q": "I stomped on the aluminum can. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The can was recycled. (B) The can got crushed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The can got crushed.\nExplanation: When you stomp on an aluminum can, the pressure and force applied causes the can to collapse and become crushed. This is a common way to prepare cans for recycling, but simply stomping on a can does not guarantee that it will be recycled."}}
{"Q": "The girl joined the debate team. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She learned to use a computer. (B) She learned communication skills.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She learned communication skills.\nExplanation: Joining the debate team would likely involve practicing and improving communication skills such as public speaking, critical thinking, and persuasive argumentation. Learning to use a computer is not necessarily related to joining a debate team."}}
{"Q": "My mood improved. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I listened to music. (B) I did the dishes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I listened to music.\nExplanation: Listening to music has been shown to have a positive effect on mood by releasing dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. Doing the dishes may provide a sense of accomplishment, but it is less likely to directly impact mood in the same way that music can."}}
{"Q": "The charity made a goal to raise money. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They fed the homeless. (B) They held an auction.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They held an auction.\nExplanation: Since the charity made a goal to raise money, holding an auction would be a more plausible answer as it is a common fundraising event. Feeding the homeless may be a possible outcome of the money raised, but it is not a direct result of the charity's goal to raise funds."}}
{"Q": "The roller coaster plunged down the steep drop. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The passengers giggled. (B) The passengers screamed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The passengers screamed.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the passengers would scream on a roller coaster drop due to the sudden rush of adrenaline and fear. Giggling may occur on less intense parts of the ride, but not during a steep drop."}}
{"Q": "I was furious. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I checked the mailbox upon leaving the house. (B) I slammed the door upon leaving the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I slammed the door upon leaving the house.\nExplanation: Slamming the door is a common physical expression of anger and frustration. Checking the mailbox does not seem like a natural response to being furious."}}
{"Q": "The man wanted to watch the sunrise. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He travelled north. (B) He got up early.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He got up early.\nExplanation: Getting up early is a more plausible answer as watching the sunrise requires waking up before the sun rises. Traveling north may or may not have any impact on watching the sunrise."}}
{"Q": "I folded the paper. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I recycled the paper. (B) The paper creased.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The paper creased.\nExplanation: When you fold a paper, it creates a crease or a bend in the paper. Recycling the paper is not a direct result of folding it."}}
{"Q": "The nation endured a natural disaster. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Leaders of other countries formed an alliance. (B) Leaders of other countries sent emergency relief.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Leaders of other countries sent emergency relief.\nExplanation: When a nation endures a natural disaster, it is common for other countries to send emergency relief to help those affected. This can include supplies such as food, water, and medical aid, as well as personnel to assist with search and rescue efforts. Forming an alliance may be a long-term goal, but immediate aid is typically the first priority."}}
{"Q": "The boy's clothes got soaked. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He climbed out of the pool. (B) He fell into the pool.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the boy fell into the pool, it is more likely that his clothes got soaked than if he simply climbed out of the pool. Climbing out of the pool would not necessarily result in completely soaked clothes, whereas falling into the pool would."}}
{"Q": "The student rushed to finish the book. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was due to be returned to the library. (B) He borrowed it from a friend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It was due to be returned to the library.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the student rushed to finish the book because it was due to be returned to the library. Borrowing a book from a friend may not have a strict deadline, but library books usually have a set return date. Therefore, it is more likely that the student was rushing to finish the book before the due date to avoid any late fees or penalties."}}
{"Q": "The criminal was executed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was thrown in jail. (B) He was convicted of murder.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He was convicted of murder.\nExplanation: The word \"executed\" implies that the criminal was put to death as a punishment for a serious crime. The only plausible option from the given choices is that he was convicted of murder, which is a capital offense in many countries. Being thrown in jail is a possible consequence of being convicted of a crime, but it does not necessarily lead to execution."}}
{"Q": "Sunlight entered the room. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I opened the curtains. (B) I unlocked the door.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I opened the curtains.\nExplanation: Sunlight entering a room is typically caused by the opening of curtains or blinds, allowing the light to pass through the window. Unlocking a door would not necessarily allow sunlight to enter the room unless the door led to an area with windows or an open space. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I yanked the imposter's hair. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her wig came off. (B) She went bald.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her wig came off.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the imposter was wearing a wig and that it came off when their hair was yanked, rather than them going completely bald from one tug."}}
{"Q": "The editor reworded a sentence in the manuscript. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He found the manuscript compelling. (B) He deemed the sentence unclear.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The editor reworded the sentence in the manuscript because he deemed it unclear. This suggests that the original sentence was not effectively communicating its intended meaning, and the editor felt the need to revise it for clarity."}}
{"Q": "The woman cancelled her credit card account. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She realized the card was missing. (B) She realized the card was expired.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She realized the card was missing.\nExplanation: If the woman realized that her credit card was missing, she would likely cancel the account to prevent any unauthorized charges. If the card was expired, she could simply request a new one and continue using the account. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man and woman fell in love. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They attended college. (B) They got married.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They got married.\nExplanation: The most common and expected outcome of two people falling in love is that they will eventually get married. While attending college together could be a possibility, it is not necessarily a direct result of falling in love. Getting married, on the other hand, is a common next step for couples who have fallen in love and want to spend their lives together."}}
{"Q": "The music was too faint to hear. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I turned up the volume. (B) I composed my own song.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I turned up the volume.\nExplanation: If the music was too faint to hear, the most plausible solution would be to turn up the volume so that it becomes audible. Composing a new song would not solve the problem of not being able to hear the current music."}}
{"Q": "The boy's hair was sticking up. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The girl ruffled it. (B) The girl pulled it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The girl ruffled it.\nExplanation: If the girl had pulled the boy's hair, it would have likely caused pain and discomfort, and the boy may have reacted negatively. However, if the girl ruffled the boy's hair, it would have caused the hair to become disheveled and stick up, which is a more plausible explanation for the boy's hair being in that state."}}
{"Q": "The bug got squashed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I sprayed myself with bug repellent. (B) I stepped on the bug.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I stepped on the bug.\nExplanation: The phrase \"got squashed\" implies that the bug was physically crushed, which is more likely to happen if someone steps on it rather than spraying themselves with bug repellent."}}
{"Q": "I opened my eyes. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I woke up. (B) I relaxed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I woke up.\nExplanation: Opening one's eyes is a natural response upon waking up from sleep. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of opening one's eyes is waking up rather than simply relaxing."}}
{"Q": "My neighbor's music was blaring. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I asked him to turn it down. (B) I asked to borrow the CD from him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I asked him to turn it down.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because if someone's music is too loud, the most common and reasonable response would be to ask them to turn it down. Asking to borrow the CD would not address the issue of the loud music and may not be a priority in the moment."}}
{"Q": "The man's family lived in poverty. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was frugal with his earnings. (B) He earned below minimum wage.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He earned below minimum wage.\nExplanation: If the man earned below minimum wage, it would be difficult for him to provide for his family's basic needs and lift them out of poverty. Being frugal with his earnings may help stretch the money, but it would not be enough to overcome the financial struggles of living in poverty."}}
{"Q": "The student graduated from the university. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He looked for a job. (B) He took up a hobby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He looked for a job.\nExplanation: Graduating from university usually means that the student has completed their education and is now ready to enter the workforce. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student would start looking for a job after graduation rather than taking up a hobby."}}
{"Q": "The artist mixed yellow paint into blue paint. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The paint splattered everywhere. (B) The paint turned green.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: When yellow paint is mixed with blue paint, it creates green paint. This is because yellow and blue are primary colors, and when mixed together, they create a secondary color, which is green. Therefore, it is more plausible that the paint turned green rather than splattering everywhere."}}
{"Q": "I changed the topic of conversation. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I ran out of things to talk about. (B) The conversation became tense.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) I ran out of things to talk about.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the change in topic was due to running out of things to talk about rather than the conversation becoming tense. When people run out of things to say, they often try to change the topic to keep the conversation going. On the other hand, if the conversation became tense, it is more likely that the participants would try to resolve the tension rather than abruptly changing the topic."}}
{"Q": "My brother was released from the hospital. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I welcomed him back home. (B) I gave him the cold shoulder.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I welcomed him back home.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the speaker would welcome their brother back home after being released from the hospital, rather than giving them the cold shoulder. It is a common social norm to show care and concern for loved ones who have been ill or hospitalized."}}
{"Q": "The curtain on the stage went up. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The opening scene of the play began. (B) The actors in the play exited the stage.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The opening scene of the play began.\nExplanation: When the curtain on the stage goes up, it is usually an indication that the play is about to start and the audience should focus their attention on the stage. The opening scene of the play usually starts immediately after the curtain goes up. Therefore, it is more plausible that the opening scene of the play began as a result of the curtain going up. Option B is unlikely because it would not make sense for the actors to exit the stage before the play even started."}}
{"Q": "The hostage submitted to the kidnapper's mandates. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The kidnapper threatened to hurt the hostage. (B) The kidnapper left the hostage by himself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is A, as the threat of harm is a common tactic used by kidnappers to control their hostages. The fear of physical harm can be a powerful motivator for someone to comply with their captor's demands. On the other hand, option B does not provide a compelling reason for the hostage to submit to the kidnapper's mandates."}}
{"Q": "A boom reverberated across the stage. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The musician tapped his foot. (B) The musician pounded the drum.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The word \"reverberated\" suggests a loud and prolonged sound, which is more likely to be caused by pounding a drum than tapping a foot."}}
{"Q": "The parents rushed to their child's bedroom. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The child awoke screaming from a nightmare. (B) The child was scared to look under her bed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The child awoke screaming from a nightmare.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as it is common for children to have nightmares and wake up screaming, causing their parents to rush to their bedroom to comfort them. On the other hand, being scared to look under the bed is not necessarily a common occurrence and may not warrant such an immediate response from the parents."}}
{"Q": "The woman communicated with sign language. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was born premature. (B) She was born deaf.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the woman was born deaf, as sign language is commonly used as a means of communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Being born premature does not necessarily lead to deafness or the use of sign language as a primary means of communication."}}
{"Q": "A drought occurred in the region. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The water became contaminated. (B) The crops perished.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The crops perished.\nExplanation: During a drought, there is a lack of rainfall which leads to a shortage of water for crops. Without sufficient water, crops cannot grow and eventually perish. Contamination of water may occur due to other factors such as pollution, but it is not a direct result of a drought."}}
{"Q": "The cat chased the bird. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bird flew away. (B) The bird caught a worm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The bird flew away.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the bird would fly away to escape from the cat rather than catching a worm while being chased."}}
{"Q": "The girl switched schools. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) School let out for the summer. (B) She moved to a new town.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She moved to a new town.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for a girl to switch schools is that she moved to a new town. If school let out for the summer, she would simply be on break and would return to the same school in the fall. Moving to a new town would require her to enroll in a new school."}}
{"Q": "The factory owner refused to raise employees' wages. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The owner appointed a new manager. (B) The employees went on strike.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The employees went on strike.\nExplanation: When the factory owner refuses to raise employees' wages, the employees may feel undervalued and may choose to take action. Going on strike is a common way for employees to protest against their employer's decision and demand better working conditions and wages. Therefore, it is more plausible that the employees went on strike rather than the owner appointing a new manager."}}
{"Q": "The leader antagonized the extremists among his country. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The extremists influenced him. (B) The extremists assassinated him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The extremists assassinated him.\nExplanation: Antagonizing extremists can lead to violent retaliation, as they may feel threatened or provoked. It is not uncommon for leaders who take a strong stance against extremist groups to become targets for assassination. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I walked barefoot on the beach. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sand stuck to my feet. (B) Waves crashed along the shore.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Sand stuck to my feet.\nExplanation: When walking barefoot on the beach, it is common for sand to stick to your feet due to the texture and composition of the sand. Waves crashing along the shore may also occur, but it is not a direct result of walking barefoot on the beach."}}
{"Q": "I woke up in the middle of the night feeling cold. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I put sweatpants on. (B) I drank a glass of water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I put sweatpants on.\nExplanation: Feeling cold in the middle of the night is a common experience, especially during the winter months. Putting on sweatpants is a logical response to feeling cold as it helps to keep the body warm. Drinking a glass of water may be a good idea for hydration, but it is not a direct solution to feeling cold."}}
{"Q": "The mother hushed her son. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her son smirked. (B) Her son whined.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Her son whined.\nExplanation: The word \"hushed\" implies that the mother wanted her son to be quiet. Smirking does not necessarily make noise, but whining does. Therefore, it is more likely that the mother hushed her son because he was whining."}}
{"Q": "A hole ripped in my jeans. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I zipped up the jeans. (B) I tripped on the pavement.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tripping on the pavement is a more plausible cause for a hole in jeans than zipping up the jeans. Zipping up the jeans may cause a small tear or snag, but a significant hole is more likely to result from a fall or scrape against a rough surface like pavement."}}
{"Q": "The boy wore braces. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got a cavity. (B) His teeth became straight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. His teeth became straight.\nExplanation: Braces are orthodontic devices used to straighten teeth and correct bite issues. Therefore, it is more plausible that wearing braces would result in straighter teeth rather than getting a cavity."}}
{"Q": "I worked out at the gym yesterday. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I woke up today with sore muscles. (B) I woke up today with a sore throat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: When you work out at the gym, it is common to experience muscle soreness the next day due to the strain on your muscles during the workout. Sore throat, on the other hand, is not a typical result of a gym workout unless you were exposed to germs or viruses at the gym. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl whispered back and forth to each other at the lunch table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Other students sat down at the lunch table. (B) Other students at the lunch table felt left out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Other students at the lunch table felt left out.\nExplanation: When a group of people whisper back and forth to each other, it can give the impression that they are talking about something secretive or exclusive. This can make others feel left out and excluded from the conversation. Therefore, it is more plausible that other students at the lunch table felt left out rather than them sitting down at the table."}}
{"Q": "The child landed on the trampoline. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She sprung back up into the air. (B) She decided to try to do a flip.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She sprung back up into the air.\nExplanation: When a child lands on a trampoline, the elasticity of the material causes them to bounce back up into the air. This is a common and expected result of landing on a trampoline. It is unlikely that the child would immediately decide to try a flip without first bouncing a few times and gaining momentum."}}
{"Q": "I deposited the letter in the mailbox. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The post office delivered the letter. (B) The post office expedited the letter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The post office delivered the letter.\nExplanation: When a letter is deposited in a mailbox, it is collected by the postal service and delivered to its intended recipient. Expedited delivery is a separate service that must be requested and paid for separately. Therefore, it is more plausible that the letter was simply delivered by the post office."}}
{"Q": "The gambler was confident. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He bet all of his money. (B) He went home broke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He bet all of his money.\nExplanation: Since the gambler was confident, he likely believed that he would win and therefore bet all of his money. This is a more plausible answer than option B, as it is unlikely that someone who is confident would go home broke without having made any bets."}}
{"Q": "The forest fire spread. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The winds became stronger. (B) The arsonists were apprehended.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The winds became stronger.\nExplanation: Strong winds can cause a forest fire to spread quickly by carrying embers and flames to new areas. Arsonists may have started the fire, but the spread of the fire was likely due to the wind."}}
{"Q": "The child skinned his knee. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His mother sent him to his room. (B) His mother put a bandage on the wound.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His mother put a bandage on the wound.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the mother would provide first aid to her child's injury by putting a bandage on the wound rather than punishing him by sending him to his room."}}
{"Q": "The man survived the deadly illness. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He signed his will. (B) He received an organ transplant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He received an organ transplant.\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that the man had a deadly illness, which means that his chances of survival were low. Signing a will has no direct correlation with surviving an illness. On the other hand, receiving an organ transplant can be a life-saving procedure for people with certain illnesses. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I took a sip of the scalding coffee. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I bit my tongue. (B) I burnt my tongue.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I burnt my tongue.\nExplanation: When you take a sip of scalding coffee, it is likely that the temperature of the liquid is too hot for your tongue to handle. This can result in burning your tongue, which can be painful and may cause temporary loss of taste. Biting your tongue is not a likely result of drinking hot coffee, as it would require a separate action or accident to occur."}}
{"Q": "The editor fired the writer. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The writer avoided bias in her stories. (B) The writer missed an important deadline.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The writer missed an important deadline.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the editor fired the writer, which implies that the writer did something wrong. The only reason given in the choices is that the writer missed an important deadline, which is a common reason for termination in the writing industry. The fact that the writer avoided bias in her stories is not relevant to the sentence and does not provide a reason for her firing."}}
{"Q": "I felt exhausted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I slept all day. (B) I studied all day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I studied all day.\nExplanation: Studying for an extended period of time can be mentally and physically draining, leading to exhaustion. While sleeping all day could also cause fatigue, it is less likely to be the cause if the person is still feeling exhausted after waking up."}}
{"Q": "The physician diagnosed the patient. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She identified the patient's symptoms. (B) She prescribed pills to the patient.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She identified the patient's symptoms.\nExplanation: The physician diagnosed the patient by identifying the patient's symptoms and determining the underlying medical condition causing those symptoms. Prescribing pills may be part of the treatment plan, but it is not the cause of the diagnosis."}}
{"Q": "I scratched my skin. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was sweaty. (B) It felt itchy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It felt itchy.\nExplanation: Scratching is a natural response to an itchy sensation on the skin. When the skin feels itchy, it can be due to a variety of reasons such as dryness, insect bites, or allergic reactions. Sweating alone is not a common cause of scratching, but it can exacerbate an existing itchy sensation. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man underwent emergency surgery. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He lost his temper. (B) He suffered a heart attack.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: A heart attack is a medical emergency that can require immediate surgery to save the person's life. Losing one's temper, while it can have negative health effects, is not typically a cause for emergency surgery."}}
{"Q": "The man's arm muscles bulged. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He flexed his arms. (B) He rubbed his arms.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He flexed his arms.\nExplanation: When someone flexes their arms, their muscles contract and become more visible, causing them to bulge. Rubbing one's arms would not cause visible muscle bulging."}}
{"Q": "The man raised his eyebrows. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was surprised. (B) He felt discouraged.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He was surprised.\nExplanation: Raising eyebrows is a common nonverbal cue that indicates surprise or disbelief. It is unlikely that the man would raise his eyebrows if he felt discouraged, as this emotion is typically associated with a downward or furrowed brow. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I excused my colleague's blunder. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I believed his intentions were good. (B) I believed that he knew better.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: By excusing the colleague's blunder, it suggests that the mistake was not intentional. Therefore, the most plausible reason for excusing the mistake is that the person believed their colleague's intentions were good, even if the execution was flawed. Option B suggests that the colleague knew better but still made a mistake, which would not be a valid reason for excusing the blunder."}}
{"Q": "The man quit smoking. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He began exercising more. (B) He started waking up earlier.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He began exercising more.\nExplanation: Quitting smoking often leads to an improvement in overall health and a desire to engage in healthier habits. Exercise is a common choice for individuals who quit smoking as it can help manage cravings and improve lung function. Waking up earlier is not necessarily a direct result of quitting smoking."}}
{"Q": "The woman punched her attacker in the nose. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The attacker's body went lifeless. (B) The attacker started to bleed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The attacker started to bleed.\nExplanation: When someone is punched in the nose, it is common for them to start bleeding due to the sensitive blood vessels in the area. It is unlikely that the attacker's body would go lifeless from a single punch to the nose."}}
{"Q": "The dart missed the bull's eye. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man's aim was off. (B) The man was losing the game.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The man's aim was off.\nExplanation: The sentence clearly states that the dart missed the bull's eye, indicating that the man's aim was not accurate. There is no mention of the man losing the game, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The homeowner requested that an exterminator come to his house. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He discovered rats in the basement. (B) He kept an ant farm in his room.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He discovered rats in the basement.\nExplanation: Rats are a common pest that homeowners may encounter, especially in basements or other areas where there is easy access to food and shelter. Ant farms, on the other hand, are a deliberate choice and not typically a reason to call an exterminator. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I suggested to my houseguest that we go out to dinner. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was too tired to prepare anything. (B) My houseguest overstayed her welcome.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I was too tired to prepare anything.\nExplanation: The fact that I suggested going out to dinner implies that I did not want to cook or prepare anything at home. This is a common reason for suggesting going out to eat, especially if one is tired or busy. The option B, that my houseguest overstayed her welcome, is not a plausible answer as it does not relate to the situation of going out to dinner."}}
{"Q": "The girl caught her brother reading her diary. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She started hiding the diary. (B) She got a new diary.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She started hiding the diary.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the girl would start hiding her diary to prevent her brother from reading it again, rather than getting a new diary altogether. Getting a new diary would not solve the problem of her brother invading her privacy."}}
{"Q": "The woman was short on money for rent. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She worked overtime. (B) She quit her job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She worked overtime.\nExplanation: If the woman was short on money for rent, it is more plausible that she would work overtime to earn extra money rather than quitting her job, which would only worsen her financial situation. Working overtime would allow her to earn more money without completely disrupting her employment."}}
{"Q": "The child's hand quickly recoiled. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He touched the hot stove. (B) He patted the puppy's head.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He touched the hot stove.\nExplanation: The use of the word \"quickly\" suggests a sudden and painful reaction, which is more likely to occur when touching a hot stove than when patting a puppy's head."}}
{"Q": "The company wanted to gauge customer satisfaction. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They offered a discount to new customers. (B) They distributed a survey to customers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They distributed a survey to customers.\nExplanation: The most logical and common way to gauge customer satisfaction is by distributing a survey to customers. This allows the company to gather feedback and insights directly from their customers, which can then be used to improve their products or services. Offering a discount to new customers may attract new business, but it does not necessarily provide information on customer satisfaction."}}
{"Q": "The wood floor became scratched. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The boy threw the cushions off the couch. (B) The boy dragged a chair across the floor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Dragging a chair across the floor is more likely to cause scratches on a wood floor than throwing cushions off a couch. The weight and friction of the chair legs against the floor can easily leave marks, while cushions are typically much lighter and softer."}}
{"Q": "I shielded my face. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My enemy taunted me. (B) My enemy cocked a fist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) My enemy cocked a fist.\nExplanation: Cocking a fist is a physical action that suggests the possibility of a physical attack, which could cause someone to shield their face in anticipation of being hit. Taunting, on the other hand, is a verbal action that may not necessarily lead to physical harm, and therefore may not be a plausible cause for someone to shield their face."}}
{"Q": "The famous statue burned down. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was struck by lightning. (B) People came to venerate it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the statue was struck by lightning, as this is a common cause of fires and damage to structures. People coming to venerate the statue would not likely cause it to burn down unless they were intentionally setting it on fire, which is not mentioned as a possibility in the question."}}
{"Q": "I left the fruit out on the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The fruit shed seeds. (B) Flies swarmed the fruit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Flies swarmed the fruit.\nExplanation: Leaving fruit out on the table can attract flies, especially if the fruit is ripe or starting to spoil. Flies are attracted to the sweet smell of fruit and can quickly swarm around it, making it unappetizing and potentially spreading bacteria. While some fruits may shed seeds over time, it is less likely to be a direct result of leaving them out on the table."}}
{"Q": "The ballerina tore a ligament. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She pointed her toes. (B) She twisted her ankle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She twisted her ankle.\nExplanation: Tearing a ligament is a common injury that occurs when a joint is forced beyond its normal range of motion. While pointing toes can strain the muscles and tendons in the foot and ankle, it is unlikely to cause a ligament tear. On the other hand, twisting an ankle can easily cause a ligament tear as the ligaments are stretched or torn due to the sudden and forceful movement of the joint. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The child's shoelaces came untied. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He learned how to tie them. (B) He ran around on the playground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He ran around on the playground.\nExplanation: Running around on the playground can cause the child's shoelaces to come untied due to the constant movement and friction. Learning how to tie shoelaces properly would actually prevent them from coming untied easily."}}
{"Q": "I became enthralled in the book. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I returned the book. (B) I lost track of time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I lost track of time.\nExplanation: When someone becomes enthralled in a book, it means they are completely absorbed and engrossed in the story. This often leads to losing track of time because the reader is so focused on the book that they forget about everything else around them. It is unlikely that someone would return a book they were enthralled in, so option A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man held similar beliefs to those of his parents. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His parents influenced him. (B) His parents disowned him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His parents influenced him.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the man's beliefs were shaped by his parents' influence rather than being disowned by them. Children often adopt the beliefs and values of their parents, especially if they have a close relationship with them. Disownment, on the other hand, is a severe form of rejection that is less likely to result in the adoption of similar beliefs."}}
{"Q": "The car gradually slowed to a stop. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It ran out of gas. (B) The driver fell asleep.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It ran out of gas.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the car gradually slowed to a stop, which indicates that it was not an abrupt stop. If the driver had fallen asleep, the car would have likely veered off the road or hit something before coming to a stop. Running out of gas is a more plausible explanation for a gradual slowdown and eventual stop."}}
{"Q": "The man ate the ice cream in the sun. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The ice cream lost its flavor. (B) The ice cream dripped from the cone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The ice cream dripped from the cone.\nExplanation: Since the man ate the ice cream in the sun, the heat would have caused the ice cream to melt and drip from the cone. It is a more plausible answer than the ice cream losing its flavor, which is not directly related to eating it in the sun."}}
{"Q": "I hung artwork in the room. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The carpet looked dirty. (B) The walls looked bare.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The walls looked bare.\nExplanation: The statement mentions hanging artwork in the room, which suggests that the reason for doing so was to add decoration or visual interest to the walls. Option (A) about the carpet looking dirty is not relevant to the action of hanging artwork on the walls. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I left work early. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had a headache. (B) My boss held a meeting.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) I had a headache.\nExplanation: A headache is a common reason for leaving work early as it can be debilitating and affect one's ability to focus and work efficiently. On the other hand, a boss holding a meeting is not necessarily a reason to leave work early unless it was an emergency or the employee was directly involved in the meeting."}}
{"Q": "The puppy soiled the carpet. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The owner scolded the puppy. (B) The owner gave the puppy a treat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The owner scolded the puppy.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the owner would scold the puppy for soiling the carpet, as this behavior is undesirable and needs to be corrected. Giving the puppy a treat would only reinforce the behavior and make it more likely to happen again in the future."}}
{"Q": "I apologized to my friend. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My friend forgave me. (B) My friend became infuriated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My friend forgave me.\nExplanation: Apologizing is a way to acknowledge one's mistake and express regret for it. It shows that the person is willing to take responsibility for their actions and make amends. In most cases, when someone apologizes to a friend, the friend is likely to forgive them and move on. It helps to restore trust and strengthen the relationship. While there may be instances where the friend may not forgive immediately, it is unlikely that they would become infuriated unless the apology was insincere or the offense was severe."}}
{"Q": "The man stood out in the crowd. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He carried a backpack. (B) He wore a neon vest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Wearing a neon vest is more likely to make someone stand out in a crowd than carrying a backpack, as it is a bright and attention-grabbing color. Additionally, neon vests are often worn by construction workers or other individuals working in hazardous environments, which could further draw attention to the man."}}
{"Q": "The witness lied under oath. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He completed his testimony. (B) He was charged with perjury.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He was charged with perjury.\nExplanation: Lying under oath is a serious offense and is considered perjury. The witness could face legal consequences for their actions, including being charged with perjury. It is unlikely that they would be allowed to complete their testimony if it was discovered that they had lied."}}
{"Q": "The woman dyed her hair. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She wanted a new look. (B) She wanted to blend in.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She wanted a new look.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the woman dyed her hair, which implies that she made a deliberate choice to change her hair color. The phrase \"wanted a new look\" suggests that she was seeking a change in her appearance, which is a common reason for dyeing one's hair. On the other hand, the option \"wanted to blend in\" does not seem as likely, as dyeing one's hair to blend in with a certain group or environment would require more context or information."}}
{"Q": "The immigrants were caught illegally residing in the country. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They found employment. (B) They were deported.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. They were deported.\nExplanation: If immigrants are caught residing illegally in a country, the most likely consequence is deportation. Finding employment is not a plausible outcome as they would not be legally authorized to work in the country without proper documentation."}}
{"Q": "The public speaker cracked a joke. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The audience laughed. (B) The audience stood up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The audience laughed.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the audience would laugh in response to a joke than stand up. Laughter is a common reaction to humor, while standing up would require a more significant reason, such as a standing ovation or protest."}}
{"Q": "I looked into the sun. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sun blinded me. (B) The sun tanned my skin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The sun blinded me.\nExplanation: Looking directly into the sun can cause damage to the retina, leading to temporary or permanent vision loss. It is not possible for the sun to tan the skin in such a short amount of time. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I felt bored. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I snorted. (B) I yawned.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I yawned.\nExplanation: Yawning is a common physiological response to boredom or tiredness. It is a natural way for the body to increase oxygen intake and stimulate the brain. Snorting, on the other hand, is not typically associated with boredom and would be an unlikely response."}}
{"Q": "The steak was difficult to cut. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The knife was dull. (B) The steak was raw.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The knife was dull.\nExplanation: If the steak was difficult to cut, it is more likely that the knife was dull rather than the steak being raw. A dull knife would not be able to slice through the meat easily, while a raw steak would still be relatively easy to cut through."}}
{"Q": "The woman declared bankruptcy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She received alimony payment. (B) She acquired massive debt.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She acquired massive debt.\nExplanation: Bankruptcy is usually declared when a person or business is unable to pay off their debts. Therefore, it is more plausible that the woman declared bankruptcy due to acquiring massive debt rather than receiving alimony payments."}}
{"Q": "The lights in my friend's apartment were on. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I wondered if he was out. (B) I decided to pay him a visit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I decided to pay him a visit.\nExplanation: If the lights were on in my friend's apartment, it would indicate that someone is likely home. Therefore, it would be more plausible to choose option B and assume that I would decide to pay him a visit rather than wondering if he was out."}}
{"Q": "I put the flower under my nose. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The petals came off the flower. (B) I picked up the flower's scent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I picked up the flower's scent.\nExplanation: When you put a flower under your nose, you are likely to inhale its fragrance or scent. This is because flowers release volatile organic compounds that can be detected by our sense of smell. The petals coming off the flower is not a likely result of simply putting it under your nose."}}
{"Q": "The woman felt nostalgic. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She ran into a childhood friend. (B) She yelled at her children.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She ran into a childhood friend.\nExplanation: Nostalgia is a feeling of longing or wistfulness for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations. Running into a childhood friend would likely trigger memories and emotions associated with that time period, leading to feelings of nostalgia. Yelling at her children would not be a likely cause for nostalgia."}}
{"Q": "The student procrastinated on the paper. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He submitted the paper early. (B) He submitted the paper incomplete.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He submitted the paper incomplete.\nExplanation: If the student procrastinated on the paper, it is unlikely that he submitted it early. It is more plausible that he rushed to complete it and submitted it incomplete. Procrastination often leads to a lack of time to complete tasks properly, resulting in incomplete or subpar work."}}
{"Q": "My car broke down. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I went to the mall. (B) I called a mechanic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I called a mechanic.\nExplanation: When a car breaks down, the most logical and practical solution is to call a mechanic to diagnose and fix the problem. Going to the mall would not solve the issue with the car."}}
{"Q": "I discarded the note. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was anonymous. (B) It was illegible.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It was illegible.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for discarding a note would be that it was illegible, meaning that the handwriting or printing was difficult or impossible to read. If the note was anonymous, it may still contain valuable information or a message that the recipient would want to know, so it would be less likely to be discarded solely for that reason."}}
{"Q": "The bird flapped its wings. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It laid eggs. (B) It ascended upwards.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It ascended upwards.\nExplanation: When a bird flaps its wings, it creates lift which allows it to ascend upwards into the air. This is a common behavior for birds when they are flying or trying to take off. Laying eggs is not a direct result of flapping wings."}}
{"Q": "I parked in the driveway. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The garage was open. (B) The garage was full.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The garage was full.\nExplanation: Since the driveway is an alternative parking spot when the garage is full, it is more plausible that the reason for parking in the driveway was due to the garage being full. If the garage was open, it would have been more convenient to park inside."}}
{"Q": "The criminal aimed the gun at his victim. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The criminal put down the gun. (B) The victim put his hands up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The victim put his hands up.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the victim would react to the threat of a gun by putting his hands up in a defensive gesture, rather than the criminal suddenly deciding to put down the weapon."}}
{"Q": "I looked forward to the weekend. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I planned to attend my uncle's funeral. (B) I planned to attend my friend's wedding.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is B because attending a friend's wedding is typically a happy and enjoyable event, while attending a funeral is usually a sad and somber occasion. Therefore, it is more likely that someone would look forward to a weekend that includes a wedding rather than a funeral."}}
{"Q": "I lost track of time. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was daydreaming. (B) I was nauseous.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Daydreaming is a more plausible answer as it is common for people to lose track of time when they are lost in thought or imagination. Nausea, on the other hand, is unlikely to cause someone to lose track of time."}}
{"Q": "The document printed out illegibly. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The printer was low on ink. (B) The print was out of paper.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The printer was low on ink.\nExplanation: If the document printed out illegibly, it is more likely that the printer was low on ink rather than out of paper. When a printer runs low on ink, the text or images may appear faded, streaky, or incomplete. On the other hand, if the printer runs out of paper, it will simply stop printing altogether. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The stadium played the national anthem. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fans turned to the flag. (B) The fans rushed the field.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The fans turned to the flag.\nExplanation: It is a common practice for fans to turn towards the flag and stand at attention during the playing of the national anthem as a sign of respect for their country. Rushing the field would be an inappropriate and unlikely response to the national anthem being played."}}
{"Q": "The dip tasted bland. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I served it. (B) I put salt in it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I put salt in it.\nExplanation: If the dip tasted bland, it means it lacked flavor. Adding salt is a common way to enhance the flavor of food, so it is more plausible that the person added salt to the dip to improve its taste. Serving the dip despite it being bland would not make sense."}}
{"Q": "I set the paper towel on the spill. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The towel absorbed the liquid. (B) The spill left a sticky residue.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The towel absorbed the liquid.\nExplanation: Paper towels are designed to absorb liquids, so it is more plausible that the towel absorbed the spill rather than leaving a sticky residue."}}
{"Q": "The woman was interrupted in the midst of reading her book. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She bookmarked her page. (B) She reread the book.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She bookmarked her page.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the woman would simply bookmark her page and resume reading later, rather than rereading the entire book due to being interrupted."}}
{"Q": "The plane hit some turbulence. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man tightened his seatbelt. (B) The man looked out the window.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The man tightened his seatbelt.\nExplanation: When a plane hits turbulence, it can cause sudden and unexpected jolts or drops in altitude. To ensure safety, passengers are advised to keep their seatbelts fastened at all times, but especially during turbulence. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man would tighten his seatbelt in response to the turbulence rather than simply looking out the window."}}
{"Q": "The boy flinched. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The girl ignored him. (B) The girl poked him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the girl poked him, as physical contact is more likely to cause someone to flinch than being ignored."}}
{"Q": "The doctors gave the patient an artificial limb. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They amputated her leg. (B) They monitored her vitals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They amputated her leg.\nExplanation: The use of an artificial limb is typically necessary when a patient has lost a limb, either through amputation or a congenital condition. Monitoring vitals would not typically result in the need for an artificial limb. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The boy pinched the girl's elbow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She shrugged her shoulders at him. (B) She jerked her arm away from him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the girl would jerk her arm away from the boy after being pinched on the elbow, as it is a natural reflex to move away from pain or discomfort. Shrugging her shoulders would not be a typical response to being pinched on the elbow."}}
{"Q": "I asked my friend for advice. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I valued his opinion. (B) I knew I was right.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that the person asked their friend for advice suggests that they value their friend's opinion and are seeking guidance or input from someone they trust. Option B, which suggests that the person already knows they are right, does not align with the act of seeking advice."}}
{"Q": "The boy stepped in mud. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The mud stuck to his shoes. (B) The mud hit him in the face.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The mud stuck to his shoes.\nExplanation: When someone steps in mud, it is more likely that the mud will stick to their shoes rather than hit them in the face. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The town received several inches of snow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Schools shut down. (B) People hid underground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Schools shut down.\nExplanation: It is common for schools to close when there is heavy snowfall as it can make it difficult and dangerous for students and staff to travel to and from school. People hiding underground is not a plausible answer as there is no reason for them to do so in response to snowfall."}}
{"Q": "The employee's shift ended. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He went home for the day. (B) He threatened to quit the job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He went home for the day.\nExplanation: It is a common practice for employees to end their shift and go home for the day. There is no indication in the question that the employee had any issues or conflicts that would lead to them threatening to quit their job. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The tree damaged the house. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The tree fell onto the roof. (B) The tree shaded the backyard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The tree fell onto the roof.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the tree caused damage to the house by falling onto the roof rather than simply shading the backyard. Falling trees are a common cause of damage to houses during storms or high winds."}}
{"Q": "The wood split in half. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I stacked the wood in the fireplace. (B) I swung the axe down to the wood.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible cause of the wood splitting in half is that someone swung an axe down onto it, which is option B. Stacking the wood in the fireplace, as in option A, would not cause the wood to split in half."}}
{"Q": "The family congratulated the couple. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The couple announced that they were separating. (B) The couple announced that they were having a baby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The couple announced that they were having a baby.\nExplanation: It is common for families to congratulate a couple when they announce that they are expecting a baby. On the other hand, it is unlikely for a family to congratulate a couple who announced that they were separating. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl sent the boy a valentine. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She liked him. (B) She kissed him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She liked him.\nExplanation: Sending a valentine is a common way of expressing romantic interest or affection towards someone. Kissing someone is also a way of showing affection, but it is not necessarily the cause of sending a valentine. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I nodded my head at my friend's statement. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was confused. (B) I agreed with him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Nodding one's head is commonly understood as a nonverbal gesture of agreement or affirmation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker nodded their head because they agreed with their friend's statement rather than being confused by it."}}
{"Q": "The friends flipped a coin. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They wanted to find a compromise. (B) They wanted to make a fair decision.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Flipping a coin is a common way to make a fair decision when there are two options and both parties are unable to come to a consensus. Therefore, it is more plausible that the friends flipped a coin to make a fair decision rather than to find a compromise."}}
{"Q": "The timer in the kitchen went off. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The man unloaded the groceries into the refrigerator. (B) The man took the pizza out of the oven.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The man took the pizza out of the oven.\nExplanation: The timer in the kitchen is usually set to remind someone that something is cooking or baking in the oven. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man took the pizza out of the oven as a result of the timer going off."}}
{"Q": "The woman set an ambitious goal. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She slacked off. (B) She worked hard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She worked hard.\nExplanation: If the woman set an ambitious goal, it is more likely that she would work hard to achieve it rather than slack off. Ambitious goals require dedication and effort to accomplish, so it is reasonable to assume that the woman would work hard to reach her goal."}}
{"Q": "The wealthy man died of old age. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His son got into legal trouble. (B) His son inherited his fortune.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His son inherited his fortune.\nExplanation: It is a common practice for wealthy individuals to leave their fortune to their children or heirs after their death. Therefore, it is more plausible that the son inherited his father's fortune rather than getting into legal trouble."}}
{"Q": "The woman stomped on the flames. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The flames went out. (B) Smoke arose from the flames.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The flames went out.\nExplanation: When someone stomps on flames, it is likely that the flames will be extinguished. Therefore, it is more plausible that the flames went out rather than smoke arising from the flames."}}
{"Q": "The woman's car was in the shop. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her driver's license was revoked. (B) She got in a car accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She got in a car accident.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as car accidents are a common reason for cars to be in the shop for repairs. Revoked driver's license would not necessarily result in the car being in the shop, as the woman could have someone else drive her car or have it towed to a different location."}}
{"Q": "I slept through my alarm. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I made breakfast. (B) I missed breakfast.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I missed breakfast.\nExplanation: If you slept through your alarm, it means you woke up later than intended and likely did not have time to make or eat breakfast before starting your day. Therefore, missing breakfast is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The public figure got out of the limousine. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cameras flashed in his direction. (B) His family attended the press conference.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Cameras flashed in his direction.\nExplanation: It is common for cameras to flash when a public figure gets out of a limousine, especially if they are attending a public event or press conference. This is because the media wants to capture images of the person and their arrival. It is less likely that the public figure's family would attend the press conference, as this would depend on the nature of the event and their involvement in it."}}
{"Q": "The woman lingered in the bathtub. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bathwater became lukewarm. (B) The bathwater drained out of the tub.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The bathwater became lukewarm.\nExplanation: If the woman lingered in the bathtub, it is likely that the hot water would have cooled down over time, resulting in lukewarm water. There is no indication in the sentence that the bathwater drained out of the tub."}}
{"Q": "The college student wanted to meet other students on campus. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He joined a fraternity. (B) He majored in engineering.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Joining a fraternity is a common way for college students to meet other students on campus. Majoring in engineering is not necessarily related to meeting other students."}}
{"Q": "I lifted up the couch cushions. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was looking for loose change. (B) I was rearranging the living room.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I was looking for loose change.\nExplanation: It is a common practice to lift up couch cushions to look for loose change that may have fallen between the cushions. It is less likely that someone would lift up the couch cushions to rearrange the living room. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The wasp flew towards the boy. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The boy ran away. (B) The boy picked a flower.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The boy ran away.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy would run away from the wasp to avoid getting stung rather than picking a flower."}}
{"Q": "The woman was found guilty of a misdemeanor. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was sentenced to perform community service. (B) She was put on death row.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She was sentenced to perform community service.\nExplanation: A misdemeanor is a less serious crime than a felony, and typically carries a punishment of a fine, probation, or community service. Death row is reserved for the most serious crimes, such as murder, and would not be a plausible punishment for a misdemeanor. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."}}
{"Q": "I stirred the sugar into the hot tea. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The tea steamed. (B) The sugar dissolved.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The sugar dissolved.\nExplanation: When sugar is stirred into hot tea, it dissolves due to the heat and agitation. This creates a homogeneous mixture where the sugar molecules are evenly distributed throughout the tea. The tea may steam as well, but that is not a direct result of stirring in the sugar."}}
{"Q": "The veteran walked with a limp. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was drafted for the war. (B) He was injured in battle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He was injured in battle.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the veteran's limp was caused by an injury sustained during battle rather than simply being drafted for the war. Many soldiers return from war with physical injuries, and a limp is a common symptom of leg injuries."}}
{"Q": "The criminal ran away from the police. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The police attended to the victim. (B) The police chased the criminal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The police chased the criminal.\nExplanation: Since the criminal ran away from the police, it is more plausible that the police would chase after the criminal in an attempt to apprehend them. Attending to the victim would not be the immediate action taken in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "The laptop wouldn't turn on. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I dropped it. (B) I charged it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Dropping the laptop could have caused internal damage to the hardware or disconnected components, leading to it not turning on. Charging the laptop is a normal and necessary function, so it is unlikely to be the cause of it not turning on."}}
{"Q": "The woman ran out of room in her closet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She acquired an extensive wardrobe. (B) She folded her laundry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She acquired an extensive wardrobe.\nExplanation: The sentence states that the woman ran out of room in her closet, which implies that there is not enough space to store her clothes. The most plausible reason for this is that she has acquired an extensive wardrobe, meaning she has accumulated a lot of clothes over time. Folding laundry may take up some space, but it is unlikely to be the sole cause of running out of room in a closet."}}
{"Q": "The man was heartbroken. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His wife gave birth. (B) His wife left him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. His wife left him.\nExplanation: If the man's wife gave birth, it would typically be a happy occasion rather than a cause for heartbreak. On the other hand, if his wife left him, it would be a more plausible reason for him to feel heartbroken."}}
{"Q": "The man obtained a degree. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He became qualified for the job he wanted. (B) His job offer was rescinded.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He became qualified for the job he wanted.\nExplanation: Obtaining a degree usually means that a person has gained the necessary knowledge and skills to perform a certain job. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man became qualified for the job he wanted after obtaining his degree. It is unlikely that his job offer would be rescinded after obtaining a degree, unless there were other factors involved."}}
{"Q": "The man's voice projected clearly throughout the auditorium. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He greeted the audience. (B) He spoke into the microphone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He spoke into the microphone.\nExplanation: The use of a microphone amplifies the sound of the speaker's voice, making it clearer and easier to hear throughout the auditorium. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man's clear projection was due to him speaking into the microphone."}}
{"Q": "I tossed a coin into the fountain of water. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The coin sunk to the bottom. (B) The coin broke in half.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The coin sunk to the bottom.\nExplanation: When a coin is tossed into a fountain of water, it is more likely to sink to the bottom due to the weight of the coin and the buoyancy of the water. It is less likely for the coin to break in half as it is not subjected to any external force that could cause it to break. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The player hit the ball toward the hole. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The ball went in the hole. (B) The ball retreated back to the player.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The ball went in the hole.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the ball went in the hole as hitting the ball towards the hole is the objective of the game of golf. The ball retreating back to the player would be an unlikely outcome unless there was some sort of obstacle or obstruction in the way."}}
{"Q": "I breathed in the dust in the attic. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I hiccupped. (B) I sneezed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Breathing in dust can cause irritation in the nasal passages, leading to sneezing as a natural reflex to expel the irritants. Hiccups are not a common reaction to inhaling dust."}}
{"Q": "The store cashier called security. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The customer used counterfeit money. (B) The customer left his headlights on.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The customer used counterfeit money.\nExplanation: The use of counterfeit money is a serious offense and can result in legal consequences. It is a plausible reason for the store cashier to call security. On the other hand, leaving headlights on is a minor issue and does not require the involvement of security."}}
{"Q": "I took the garbage out. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The garbage made the kitchen smell bad. (B) I accidentally threw away my shopping list.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The garbage made the kitchen smell bad.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the cause of taking out the garbage was due to the unpleasant smell it was emitting rather than accidentally throwing away a shopping list. Taking out the garbage is a common solution to eliminate bad odors in the kitchen."}}
{"Q": "The family went to the zoo. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The children admired the animals. (B) The children chased the animals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The children admired the animals.\nExplanation: Going to the zoo is usually a fun and educational experience for children. They get to see different animals up close and learn about their habitats and behaviors. It is unlikely that the children would chase the animals as it is not allowed and can be dangerous for both the animals and the visitors. Therefore, it is more plausible that the children admired the animals during their visit to the zoo."}}
{"Q": "The man's breathing was loud. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His kidneys were failing. (B) His lungs were congested.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His lungs were congested.\nExplanation: Loud breathing is often a symptom of congested or obstructed airways, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as allergies, infections, or lung diseases. Kidney failure, on the other hand, is unlikely to directly cause loud breathing. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I had an extra ticket for the concert. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I asked my friend for directions to the venue. (B) I asked my friend if he was interested in going.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I asked my friend if he was interested in going.\nExplanation: Since the statement mentions having an extra ticket, it is more plausible that the person would ask a friend if they were interested in going rather than asking for directions to the venue."}}
{"Q": "The air conditioner in the house broke. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I brought out blankets. (B) I opened the windows.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I opened the windows.\nExplanation: Opening the windows would be a more plausible answer as it would allow fresh air to circulate and cool down the house. Bringing out blankets would not address the issue of the broken air conditioner and would not provide any relief from the heat."}}
{"Q": "The boy's back ached. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His backpack was open. (B) His backpack was heavy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His backpack was heavy.\nExplanation: Carrying a heavy backpack for a prolonged period of time can cause back pain and discomfort. An open backpack may cause items to shift and create an uneven weight distribution, but it is less likely to cause significant back pain compared to a heavy backpack."}}
{"Q": "I bought my mother a present. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I baked her a cake. (B) It was her birthday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It was her birthday.\nExplanation: Buying a present for someone is a common practice on their birthday, so it is more plausible that the cause of buying a present for the mother was her birthday. Baking a cake could also be a reason for a present, but it is not explicitly stated in the question."}}
{"Q": "The daffodils in the garden were destroyed. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A bee stung the gardener. (B) Squirrels dug up the bulbs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Squirrels dug up the bulbs.\nExplanation: Squirrels are known to dig up bulbs in gardens, especially in the fall when they are storing food for the winter. Daffodil bulbs are a common target for squirrels, as they are easy to dig up and provide a good source of nutrients. A bee sting would not have caused the destruction of the daffodils, as bees do not typically damage plants in this way."}}
{"Q": "I struck the match. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The flame faded out. (B) The match produced a flame.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The match produced a flame.\nExplanation: When a match is struck, the friction between the match head and the striking surface creates heat, which ignites the chemicals on the match head and produces a flame. Therefore, it is more plausible that the match produced a flame rather than the flame fading out."}}
{"Q": "The disputing parties reached a settlement. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They didn't want to debate in court. (B) They wanted to repair their personal relationship.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They didn't want to debate in court.\nExplanation: The fact that the parties reached a settlement suggests that they were able to come to an agreement outside of court. This implies that they did not want to go through the time, expense, and uncertainty of a court battle. Option B is less likely because the question does not provide any information about the nature of the dispute or the relationship between the parties."}}
{"Q": "The children were sent to an orphanage. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their parents died. (B) Their parents spoiled them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Their parents died.\nExplanation: The most plausible reason for children to be sent to an orphanage is if their parents have died and there are no other family members or guardians who can take care of them. It is unlikely that children would be sent to an orphanage simply because their parents spoiled them."}}
{"Q": "A meteorite landed in the ocean. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A tsunami occurred. (B) It began to hail.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A tsunami occurred.\nExplanation: When a meteorite lands in the ocean, it can create a large wave or tsunami due to the impact. The force of the impact can displace a large amount of water, causing a wave to form and travel outward from the impact site. This can result in a tsunami that can cause significant damage to coastal areas. Hail, on the other hand, is formed by thunderstorms and has no connection to meteorite impacts."}}
{"Q": "The hiker encountered a poisonous snake. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She became dehydrated. (B) She panicked.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She panicked.\nExplanation: When encountering a poisonous snake, it is common for people to experience fear and panic. This can lead to a fight or flight response, which can cause physical symptoms such as increased heart rate and sweating. It is unlikely that encountering a snake would directly cause dehydration, unless the hiker was already in a situation where they were not properly hydrated."}}
{"Q": "The oven became hot. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I turned the oven on. (B) I put the dish in the oven.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I turned the oven on.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the oven becoming hot is that it was turned on. Putting a dish in the oven may contribute to the oven becoming hotter, but it is not the initial cause of the oven heating up."}}
{"Q": "I squeezed the lemon wedge. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The lemon got moldy. (B) The lemon squirted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The lemon squirted.\nExplanation: When you squeeze a lemon wedge, the pressure applied to the lemon causes the juice to be released, resulting in the lemon squirting. Mold growth is not a direct result of squeezing a lemon wedge."}}
{"Q": "The country discovered new land. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The country abandoned the land. (B) The country colonized the land.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The country colonized the land.\nExplanation: Historically, when a country discovered new land, they often claimed it as their own and established colonies on the land. This was a common practice during the Age of Exploration, when European countries discovered and colonized new territories in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Therefore, it is more plausible that the country would colonize the land rather than abandon it."}}
{"Q": "The glass toppled off the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It shattered all over the floor. (B) It landed in a pile of laundry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: When a glass topples off a table, it is likely to break and shatter into pieces. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B is less likely as it would require the glass to have fallen onto a pile of laundry that was conveniently placed nearby."}}
{"Q": "The table wobbled. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The floor was uneven. (B) The floor was slippery.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The floor was uneven.\nExplanation: An uneven floor is more likely to cause a table to wobble than a slippery floor. If the floor is not level, one or more legs of the table may not be making full contact with the ground, causing the table to wobble. A slippery floor may cause someone to slip and fall, but it is less likely to affect the stability of a table."}}
{"Q": "The father caught his son lying. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His son confessed the truth. (B) The father trusted his son.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His son confessed the truth.\nExplanation: If the father caught his son lying, it is more likely that the son would confess the truth rather than the father trusting him immediately. Trust needs to be rebuilt after a lie, and the son would need to take responsibility for his actions by confessing."}}
{"Q": "The man's head throbbed with pain. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He took cough syrup. (B) He took aspirin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He took aspirin.\nExplanation: Aspirin is a common pain reliever that is often used to alleviate headaches. Cough syrup, on the other hand, is used to treat coughs and other respiratory symptoms, and would not be effective in treating a headache. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man would take aspirin to relieve his headache."}}
{"Q": "The train slowed down. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was approaching the station. (B) It was running behind schedule.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It was approaching the station.\nExplanation: Trains typically slow down when approaching a station to prepare for stopping and allowing passengers to board or disembark. Running behind schedule may cause a train to speed up in order to make up time, rather than slowing down. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man went through therapy. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mental illness ran in his family. (B) He was diagnosed with depression.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He was diagnosed with depression.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because therapy is a common treatment for depression. Mental illness running in his family may be a contributing factor, but it does not necessarily mean that he would need therapy."}}
{"Q": "The woman clutched her throat. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She swallowed her food. (B) She choked on her food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She choked on her food.\nExplanation: The act of clutching one's throat is a common sign of choking, which occurs when food or other objects become lodged in the airway and obstruct breathing. Swallowing food, on the other hand, is a normal bodily function and would not typically cause someone to clutch their throat in distress. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The woman had a sore throat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her voice sounded raspy. (B) She spoke with an accent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her voice sounded raspy.\nExplanation: A sore throat can cause inflammation and irritation in the vocal cords, leading to a hoarse or raspy voice. Speaking with an accent is not a common result of a sore throat."}}
{"Q": "The dog eyed the juicy steak on the table. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It drooled. (B) It laid down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It drooled.\nExplanation: Dogs often drool when they see or smell food that they want. This is a natural response to the anticipation of eating. Laying down may be a possible reaction, but it is less likely than drooling in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "The woman's business succeeded. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She fired her employees. (B) She became wealthy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the woman became wealthy as a result of her business succeeding, rather than firing her employees. Success in business often leads to financial gain, which would make the woman wealthy. Firing employees would not necessarily be a direct result of the business succeeding."}}
{"Q": "The students exited the classroom. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bell rang. (B) The teacher assigned homework.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The bell rang.\nExplanation: The most common reason for students to exit a classroom is when the bell rings, indicating the end of class. It is less likely that the teacher assigning homework would cause all the students to leave the classroom at the same time."}}
{"Q": "The woman claimed she saw a ghost. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her acquaintances expressed skepticism. (B) Her acquaintances related to her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her acquaintances expressed skepticism.\nExplanation: Since the claim of seeing a ghost is often met with skepticism and disbelief, it is more plausible that her acquaintances expressed skepticism rather than related to her."}}
{"Q": "The man lost his hearing. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He nearly drowned in the ocean. (B) He was nearly killed in an explosion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man lost his hearing due to being nearly killed in an explosion, as explosions can cause damage to the ears and result in hearing loss. While drowning can also cause damage to the ears, it is less likely to result in complete hearing loss."}}
{"Q": "The child let go of the balloon string. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The balloon deflated. (B) The balloon rose into the air.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The balloon rose into the air.\nExplanation: When a balloon is released, it rises into the air due to the buoyancy of the helium gas inside it. The balloon does not deflate immediately unless it is punctured or damaged in some way. Therefore, it is more plausible that the balloon rose into the air when the child let go of the string."}}
{"Q": "The man lost his ability to speak. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He had a stroke. (B) He took a deep breath.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He had a stroke.\nExplanation: A stroke can cause damage to the brain, including the areas responsible for speech. This can result in difficulty speaking or even complete loss of the ability to speak. Taking a deep breath, on the other hand, is unlikely to cause such a significant and sudden loss of speech."}}
{"Q": "The woman tripped on the sidewalk. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There was a crack in the cement. (B) She heard her name being called.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There was a crack in the cement.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the woman tripped on the sidewalk due to a crack in the cement rather than hearing her name being called. Tripping on a crack in the sidewalk is a common occurrence and can easily cause someone to lose their balance, while hearing one's name being called would not typically cause someone to trip."}}
{"Q": "The man did a canon ball into the pool. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The lifeguard jumped in after him. (B) The man soaked the lifeguard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since the man did a canon ball into the pool, it is more likely that he would create a big splash and soak the lifeguard rather than the lifeguard immediately jumping in after him."}}
{"Q": "I took antibiotics. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My infection cleared up. (B) My infection spread.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My infection cleared up.\nExplanation: Antibiotics are medications that are used to treat bacterial infections. They work by killing or stopping the growth of bacteria. Therefore, taking antibiotics would most likely result in the clearing up of the infection. It is unlikely that the infection would spread as a result of taking antibiotics."}}
{"Q": "The traffic light turned yellow. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The driver pushed the brake. (B) The driver honked his horn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The driver pushed the brake.\nExplanation: When the traffic light turns yellow, it indicates that the signal is about to turn red. Therefore, the driver should slow down and prepare to stop. The most plausible action in this situation would be to push the brake to slow down the vehicle and stop at the signal. Honking the horn would not be a necessary or appropriate action in this situation."}}
{"Q": "The plastic container melted. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I soaked the container in warm water. (B) I placed the container on the hot stove.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Placing the plastic container on a hot stove would generate enough heat to melt the plastic. Soaking the container in warm water would not generate enough heat to melt the plastic. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The car got dented. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The driver hit a telephone pole. (B) The driver ran a red light.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The driver hit a telephone pole.\nExplanation: A dent in a car is more likely to be caused by a collision with a stationary object like a telephone pole than by running a red light, which would typically result in a more severe accident with multiple points of impact."}}
{"Q": "The boy studied all night. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He skipped the exam. (B) He passed the exam.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He passed the exam.\nExplanation: Since the boy studied all night, it is more likely that he was well-prepared for the exam and therefore passed it. Skipping the exam would not be a logical result of studying all night."}}
{"Q": "The young boy clung to the ledge of the pool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He feared learning to swim. (B) The lifeguard was on duty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He feared learning to swim.\nExplanation: The fact that the young boy is clinging to the ledge of the pool suggests that he is afraid of being in the water. The presence of a lifeguard does not necessarily explain why he is clinging to the ledge. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I put my hand to my chest. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I felt my heartbeat. (B) My heart rate sped up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I felt my heartbeat.\nExplanation: When you put your hand to your chest, you are likely to feel your heartbeat. This is because the heart is located in the chest and pumps blood throughout the body, causing a rhythmic pulsation that can be felt through the chest wall. It is unlikely that putting your hand to your chest would cause your heart rate to speed up, as this is typically a response to physical activity or stress."}}
{"Q": "The building adjacent to my office was under construction. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My office was crowded. (B) My office was noisy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. My office was noisy.\nExplanation: Construction work is often associated with loud noises from machinery, drilling, and hammering. Therefore, it is more plausible that the building under construction would cause noise disturbance in the adjacent office rather than crowding."}}
{"Q": "The family wanted to get to know their new neighbors. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The family invited the neighbors over for dinner. (B) The family waved to the neighbors from their yard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The family invited the neighbors over for dinner.\nExplanation: Getting to know someone usually involves some form of interaction or communication. While waving to the neighbors from their yard is a friendly gesture, it may not necessarily lead to a deeper connection or relationship. Inviting the neighbors over for dinner, on the other hand, allows for more meaningful conversation and a chance to get to know each other better. Therefore, it is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Water splashed up from the pool. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The swimmer dove into the pool. (B) The swimmer floated in the pool.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The swimmer dove into the pool.\nExplanation: When a swimmer dives into a pool, they create a force that pushes the water out of the way, causing it to splash up. On the other hand, if a swimmer is just floating in the pool, they are not creating any force that would cause water to splash up. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I bit into a slice of watermelon. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I accidentally swallowed a seed. (B) I accidentally chipped my tooth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I accidentally swallowed a seed.\nExplanation: It is more common to accidentally swallow a seed while eating watermelon than to chip a tooth. Watermelon seeds are small and can easily be swallowed without noticing, while chipping a tooth would require a significant amount of force and is less likely to happen while eating a soft fruit like watermelon."}}
{"Q": "The boy tripped. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His jacket was unzipped. (B) His shoelaces were untied.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His shoelaces were untied.\nExplanation: Tripping is a common consequence of having untied shoelaces, whereas an unzipped jacket is unlikely to cause someone to trip. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cause of the boy's trip was his untied shoelaces."}}
{"Q": "The woman put earplugs in. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was distracted by noise. (B) She got her ears pierced.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the woman put earplugs in because she was distracted by noise. Earplugs are commonly used to block out unwanted noise and create a quieter environment. Getting her ears pierced would not be a reason to use earplugs."}}
{"Q": "I refilled my water bottle. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I drank all the water in it. (B) I kept it in the fridge.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the person drank all the water in the bottle, which is a common reason for refilling a water bottle. Keeping it in the fridge may make the water colder, but it does not necessarily require a refill."}}
{"Q": "The television show was censored. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It contained vulgar language. (B) It had a complicated plot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most likely cause of censorship on a television show is the use of vulgar language, as this is a common reason for censorship in the media. A complicated plot would not typically be a reason for censorship."}}
{"Q": "The ship wrecked. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The crew drowned. (B) The crew encountered pirates.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The crew may have survived but faced challenges due to the shipwreck.\nExplanation: While it is possible that the crew drowned, it is also possible that they survived the shipwreck but faced challenges such as being stranded on an island or having to navigate dangerous waters to reach safety. The option of encountering pirates seems less likely as it is not directly related to the shipwreck itself."}}
{"Q": "The boy felt stumped by the riddle. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He solved the riddle. (B) He requested a hint.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He requested a hint.\nExplanation: Since the boy felt stumped by the riddle, it is more likely that he would ask for a hint rather than solve the riddle on his own."}}
{"Q": "The phone rang. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The man hung up the phone. (B) The man picked up the phone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The man picked up the phone.\nExplanation: When the phone rings, it is a natural response to pick it up to answer the call. Hanging up the phone would not make sense as the person on the other end has not had a chance to speak yet. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man picked up the phone."}}
{"Q": "The woman was staring at me. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I hugged her. (B) I felt uncomfortable.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I felt uncomfortable.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the woman's stare made the person feel uncomfortable rather than prompting them to hug her. Staring can be seen as intrusive or intimidating, and it is a common reaction to feel uneasy or self-conscious when someone is staring at you."}}
{"Q": "The group left the museum. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They took pictures of the exhibits. (B) They viewed all the exhibits.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They viewed all the exhibits.\nExplanation: Since the sentence states that the group left the museum, it implies that they have finished their visit. Option (A) does not provide a reason for leaving the museum, whereas option (B) suggests that they left because they had seen all the exhibits. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man started an argument with me. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My friend introduced me to the man. (B) My friend stood up for me.", "R": {"text": "Answer: My friend stood up for me.\nExplanation: If the man started an argument with the speaker, it is likely that the friend would stand up for them and defend them. It is less likely that the friend would introduce the speaker to someone who just started an argument with them."}}
{"Q": "The tire on my bike was flat. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I pumped air into the tire. (B) I switched gears on the bike.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I pumped air into the tire.\nExplanation: If the tire on the bike was flat, the most logical solution would be to pump air into the tire to inflate it. Switching gears on the bike would not have any effect on the flat tire."}}
{"Q": "The girl looked pale. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her father read her a story. (B) Her father felt her forehead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Her father felt her forehead.\nExplanation: If the girl looked pale, it could be a sign of illness or fatigue. Feeling her forehead would be a logical next step to check for a fever, which could indicate an illness. Reading her a story would not necessarily address the cause of her paleness."}}
{"Q": "The pen ran out of ink. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I used a pencil. (B) I signed my name.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I used a pencil.\nExplanation: Since the pen ran out of ink, it would not be possible to continue using it. Therefore, the most plausible option would be to switch to a different writing instrument, such as a pencil. Signing one's name would not be possible without ink, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The man was denied for a loan. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was in debt. (B) He started a business.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He was in debt.\nExplanation: Being in debt is a common reason for loan denial as it indicates a higher risk for the lender. Starting a business may or may not affect loan approval depending on the lender's policies and the financial stability of the business. However, being in debt is a more plausible reason for loan denial."}}
{"Q": "The girl stayed home from school. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She had chicken pox. (B) She enjoyed learning math.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She had chicken pox.\nExplanation: Chicken pox is a common illness that can cause a person to stay home from school due to its contagious nature and discomfort. Enjoying learning math is not a valid reason for missing school."}}
{"Q": "The trash bag was full. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I took it to the dumpster. (B) I dumped it down the sink.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I took it to the dumpster.\nExplanation: It is common practice to dispose of full trash bags in a dumpster or garbage can. Dumping it down the sink would not be a logical or appropriate solution."}}
{"Q": "I vacuumed the carpet. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My roommate spilled punch. (B) My dog shed hair.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. My dog shed hair.\nExplanation: Vacuuming the carpet is a common task to remove pet hair and dander. It is more plausible that the cause of vacuuming the carpet was due to the dog shedding hair rather than the roommate spilling punch."}}
{"Q": "The man lost his temper. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He turned off his computer. (B) He threw a chair across the room.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Losing one's temper can lead to impulsive and irrational behavior, such as throwing objects. Turning off a computer is a relatively calm response compared to throwing a chair, which suggests a more intense emotional reaction. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girl threw a twig into the campfire. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The twig burned. (B) The fire went out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The twig burned.\nExplanation: When a twig is thrown into a campfire, it is highly likely that it will catch fire and burn. The heat from the fire will ignite the twig, causing it to burn and turn to ash. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer. Option B, on the other hand, is unlikely as throwing a twig into a campfire would not be enough to put out the fire."}}
{"Q": "The man got out of the shower. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The hot water was gone. (B) He couldn't find a towel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He couldn't find a towel.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man got out of the shower because he couldn't find a towel to dry himself off, rather than the hot water suddenly running out. It is common for people to misplace or forget to bring a towel into the bathroom, leading them to have to get out of the shower to find one."}}
{"Q": "The parents wanted their children to go to college. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They set aside a savings fund for tuition. (B) They encouraged their children to play outside.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They set aside a savings fund for tuition.\nExplanation: If the parents wanted their children to go to college, it is likely that they would take steps to make that happen, such as saving money for tuition. Encouraging their children to play outside would not necessarily be related to their desire for their children to attend college."}}
{"Q": "The man unlaced his shoes. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The shoes loosened. (B) The shoes became worn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The shoes loosened.\nExplanation: When the man unlaced his shoes, the laces were no longer holding the shoes tightly to his feet, causing them to loosen. This is a logical and expected result of unlacing shoes. Option B, that the shoes became worn, does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the act of unlacing caused any damage to the shoes."}}
{"Q": "The man ate half of the entree. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He refrigerated the leftovers. (B) He saved the recipe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He refrigerated the leftovers.\nExplanation: If the man ate half of the entree, it is likely that there were leftovers. Therefore, it makes sense that he would refrigerate them for later consumption. Saving the recipe would not be a direct result of eating half of the entree."}}
{"Q": "My ankle was swollen. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I put ice on it. (B) I rubbed lotion on it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I put ice on it.\nExplanation: When an ankle is swollen, it is usually due to inflammation caused by an injury or strain. Applying ice to the affected area can help reduce swelling by constricting blood vessels and decreasing blood flow to the area. Rubbing lotion on the swollen ankle would not have any effect on reducing the swelling."}}
{"Q": "My office door was open. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I talked to my colleague at my desk. (B) I overheard the conversation in the hall.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I overheard the conversation in the hall.\nExplanation: If the office door was open, it is more likely that someone passing by in the hall would be heard rather than a colleague at the desk. Additionally, if the person at the desk wanted to talk to the colleague, they could have gone to their office or called them."}}
{"Q": "I had to wait in line. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I took a seat. (B) I skimmed a magazine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I skimmed a magazine.\nExplanation: Since the statement mentions waiting in line, it is more plausible that the person would pass the time by reading a magazine rather than taking a seat, which may not have been available or necessary. Skimming a magazine is a common way to pass time while waiting in line."}}
{"Q": "The man swatted at the fly. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fly buzzed away. (B) The fly stayed still.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The fly buzzed away.\nExplanation: When someone swats at a fly, it is a natural reaction for the fly to fly away to avoid being hit. Therefore, it is more plausible that the fly buzzed away as a result of the man swatting at it."}}
{"Q": "The man wrote a will. What was the cause of this?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was dying. (B) He was a widower.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the man was dying, as writing a will is typically done in preparation for one's death. While being a widower may also prompt someone to write a will, it is not as strong of a reason as facing one's own mortality."}}
{"Q": "The runner sensed his competitor gaining on him. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He dropped out of the race. (B) He sped up his pace.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He sped up his pace.\nExplanation: It is common for runners to increase their speed when they sense their competitor gaining on them. This is because they want to maintain their lead or try to overtake their competitor. Dropping out of the race would not be a likely response in this situation."}}
{"Q": "I thought carefully about the problem. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I asked for advice. (B) I came up with a solution.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Thinking carefully about a problem often leads to coming up with a solution. While asking for advice may also be a helpful step, it is not necessarily the immediate result of thinking carefully about the problem."}}
{"Q": "The traveler walked on the shaky suspension bridge. What happened as a result?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He felt terrified. (B) He felt ecstatic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He felt terrified.\nExplanation: Walking on a shaky suspension bridge can be a nerve-wracking experience for many people. The uncertainty of the bridge's stability and the height can cause fear and anxiety in the traveler. Therefore, it is more plausible that the traveler felt terrified rather than ecstatic."}}
{"Q": "The man anticipated the team's victory. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He met his friends to watch the game. (B) He made a bet with his friends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The sentence only states that the man anticipated the team's victory, but it does not suggest that he made a bet with his friends. Meeting his friends to watch the game is a more plausible answer as it is a common social activity to watch sports games with friends."}}
{"Q": "The boy couldn't fall asleep. What happened as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He set his alarm clock. (B) He counted sheep.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He counted sheep.\nExplanation: Counting sheep is a common technique used to help people fall asleep. It involves visualizing a flock of sheep jumping over a fence one by one, which can be a calming and repetitive activity that helps to quiet the mind and induce sleep. Setting an alarm clock would not necessarily help the boy fall asleep, as it only ensures that he wakes up at a certain time."}}
