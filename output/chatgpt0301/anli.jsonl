{"Q": "Ron started his new job as a landscaper today. Which event could cause Ron is immediately fired for insubordination?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ron ignores his bosses's orders and called him an idiot. (B) Ron's boss called him an idiot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Ignoring orders and insulting one's boss is a clear act of insubordination and would likely result in immediate termination. On the other hand, if Ron's boss called him an idiot, it would be unprofessional and inappropriate, but it would not necessarily be grounds for immediate termination unless it was part of a pattern of abusive behavior."}}
{"Q": "Sandy lived in New York. Which event could cause Sandy was prepared?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It stormed in New York. (B) She partied all night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It stormed in New York.\nExplanation: Living in New York, Sandy would likely be aware of the potential for storms and would take precautions such as having emergency supplies on hand. Therefore, if a storm were to occur, it is more likely that Sandy would be prepared for it. Partying all night would not necessarily require any preparation."}}
{"Q": "Mary's mom came home with more bananas than they could possibly eat. Which event could cause That was the best way ever to eat a banana?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary and her mom decided to make chocolate covered frozen bananas to avoid waste. (B) So Mary made pineapple splits for everyone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Mary's mom came home with more bananas than they could possibly eat, it makes sense that they would try to find a way to use them before they go bad. Making chocolate covered frozen bananas is a creative and delicious way to use up extra bananas, and it's possible that Mary and her mom enjoyed them so much that they declared it the best way ever to eat a banana. On the other hand, making pineapple splits doesn't necessarily involve bananas, and it seems less likely that this event would lead to the statement about the best way to eat a banana."}}
{"Q": "Jim was working on a project. Which event could cause Luckily, he found it on a nearby shelf?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim found he was missing an item. (B) Jim needed a certain animal for it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jim found he was missing an item.\nExplanation: If Jim found he was missing an item, it would make sense that he would search for it and eventually find it on a nearby shelf. On the other hand, needing a certain animal for the project does not necessarily relate to finding an item on a nearby shelf."}}
{"Q": "Sean was sitting at his desk. Which event could cause After a minute, he was able to put the chair back together?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He noticed the chair leg was falling off. (B) He leaned too far back and his chair tipped over.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Sean noticed that the chair leg was falling off, he would have had to take the chair apart to fix it. After fixing it, he would be able to put the chair back together. On the other hand, if Sean leaned too far back and his chair tipped over, it is unlikely that he would be able to put the chair back together in just one minute."}}
{"Q": "Pablo likes to eat worms. Which event could cause Pablo does not enjoy eating worms?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Pablo thought that worms were a delicious source of protein. (B) Pablo then learned what worms really are.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Pablo then learned what worms really are.\nExplanation: Once Pablo learns what worms really are, he may no longer find them appetizing or enjoyable to eat. This is a more plausible answer as it is common for people to change their food preferences once they learn more about the ingredients or where the food comes from."}}
{"Q": "There was a scientist who wanted to collect bacteria samples. Which event could cause The bacteria was non harmful?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The scientist collected samples of the bacteria and tested them. (B) He collected the bacteria and froze it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The scientist would need to test the bacteria samples to determine if they were harmful or not. Freezing the bacteria would not necessarily make it non-harmful."}}
{"Q": "I joined the Navy. Which event could cause That angered me so I hit him and was arrested by the military police?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My commanding officer told me I wasn't doing bad at my job. (B) My drill sergeant insulted my mother.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) My drill sergeant insulted my mother.\nExplanation: Insulting someone's mother is a serious offense in many cultures and can be seen as a personal attack. In the military, disrespect towards a superior officer or drill sergeant is not tolerated and can result in disciplinary action. It is plausible that this event could have caused the individual to react with anger and violence, leading to their arrest by the military police."}}
{"Q": "Dotty was being very grumpy. Which event could cause She felt much better afterwards?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dotty ate something bad. (B) Dotty call some close friends to chat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Dotty called some close friends to chat.\nExplanation: It is more likely that social interaction with close friends would improve Dotty's mood than eating something bad, which could potentially make her feel worse. Talking to friends can provide emotional support and a sense of connection, which can help alleviate grumpiness."}}
{"Q": "Ali's mom enrolled her in a karate class. Which event could cause Ali was so embarrassed she didn't tell any of her friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ali did not want to take karate. (B) Ali did horribly in her last class.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Ali did horribly in her last class.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ali would be embarrassed to tell her friends if she did poorly in her last class, rather than not wanting to take karate at all. If she didn't want to take karate, she could simply tell her friends that she didn't enjoy it. However, if she did poorly in her last class, she may feel ashamed and not want to share that with her friends."}}
{"Q": "A sob escaped Cory's lips. Which event could cause When he got home, he curled into a ball in the corner and cried?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cory was teased by some of the kids in his classroom. (B) Cory ran away from home as fast as he could.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Being teased by classmates can be emotionally distressing and can cause someone to feel embarrassed, ashamed, or hurt. This could lead to Cory feeling overwhelmed with emotions and crying when he got home. Running away from home would not necessarily cause him to curl up in a ball and cry in the corner."}}
{"Q": "Many young adults play in the marching band in school. Which event could cause Dennis loves his marching band and enjoys entertaining the fans?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People went to watch the band play. (B) Dennis has been a member for ten seconds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) People went to watch the band play.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Dennis's enjoyment of entertaining fans. If people didn't come to watch the band play, Dennis wouldn't have the opportunity to perform and entertain them. Additionally, the fact that Dennis loves his marching band suggests that he has been a member for a longer period of time than just ten seconds, making option (B) less likely."}}
{"Q": "Deb wanted to go shopping. Which event could cause She found everything she needed and had money left over?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Deb went to a matinee movie instead. (B) Deb had a lot of coupons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Deb had a lot of coupons.\nExplanation: If Deb had a lot of coupons, she would be able to save money on the items she needed to buy, which would leave her with money left over. Going to a matinee movie instead would not have any impact on her shopping trip."}}
{"Q": "My cousin Kory was working at the airport. Which event could cause He is now serving out his sentence?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kory stole from the airport. (B) He got caught anti-shoplifting from passengers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Kory stole from the airport.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Kory was caught stealing from the airport, as this is a more serious offense than shoplifting from passengers. Additionally, working at the airport would provide Kory with more opportunities to steal from the airport itself, such as from luggage or merchandise, rather than from individual passengers."}}
{"Q": "Daniel wanted to buy a toy plane, but he didn't have any money. Which event could cause He bought his toy plane, and kept working so he could buy another?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He opened a lemonade stand. (B) Daniel stayed home and didn't want to buy a plane.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Opening a lemonade stand is a plausible event that could allow Daniel to earn money to buy his toy plane. It shows that he is taking initiative and working hard to achieve his goal. On the other hand, staying home and not wanting to buy a plane does not provide a solution to Daniel's problem of not having money."}}
{"Q": "Jenna hit the weight hard in the gym. Which event could cause She took a cold bath in order to alleviate her pain?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her neck pain stopped because of this. (B) Jenna pulled a muscle lifting weights.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Taking a cold bath is a common remedy for muscle soreness and pain, which suggests that Jenna may have pulled a muscle while lifting weights. It is less likely that a cold bath would alleviate neck pain unless it was related to muscle soreness or tension in the neck."}}
{"Q": "It was lunch time and Kat was hungry. Which event could cause Kat and her coworkers enjoyed a nice lunch outside?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kat went to get a salad. (B) Kat decided to take a nap instead of eating.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Kat went to get a salad.\nExplanation: If Kat went to get a salad, it is possible that she invited her coworkers to join her for lunch outside. They could have enjoyed a nice meal together while taking a break from work. However, if Kat decided to take a nap instead of eating, it is unlikely that her coworkers would have joined her for lunch outside."}}
{"Q": "Cosmo was a pudgy cat. Which event could cause Now he's fit and muscular?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His owner gave him a lower fat cat food. (B) The vet put Cosmo on a treadmill.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His owner gave him a lower fat cat food.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a change in diet would lead to weight loss and muscle gain in a cat rather than putting them on a treadmill. While exercise is important for cats, it is unlikely that a vet would prescribe a treadmill as the sole solution for weight loss. A change in diet, on the other hand, is a common and effective way to help cats lose weight and become more fit."}}
{"Q": "Tim was a boy scout, and went on many camping trips with his friends. Which event could cause Eventually, Tim had to go home without any socks?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim became very sick one day. (B) Tim could not find his socks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tim could not find his socks.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tim simply lost or misplaced his socks while on a camping trip, rather than becoming very sick and having to leave without them. Losing or forgetting items while camping is a common occurrence, and socks are a small item that could easily be misplaced."}}
{"Q": "One day Adam bought two BB guns. Which event could cause Adam took the gun away from Christian?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Adam's brother Christian was afraid of the guns. (B) Christian grabbed the gun and shot Adam in the eye.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Adam took the gun away from Christian because he was afraid of it, rather than Christian grabbing the gun and shooting Adam in the eye. The latter scenario is dangerous and unlikely, while the former scenario is a common reason for someone to take a gun away from someone else."}}
{"Q": "My friend is a hunter. Which event could cause The elk was nowhere to be found?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She set up a hunting blind in the woods. (B) My friend who is a hunter found lots of elk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Setting up a hunting blind in the woods does not guarantee that elk will be present in that specific area. It is possible that the elk have migrated to a different location or have been scared off by other hunters or predators. Therefore, it is more plausible that the elk was nowhere to be found due to natural factors rather than the hunter finding lots of elk."}}
{"Q": "I walked into my math class. Which event could cause I ended up failing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I saw the string by the door. (B) I didn't study for the test.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I didn't study for the test.\nExplanation: Not studying for the test is a more plausible reason for failing a math class than simply seeing a string by the door. While the string may be a distraction, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on one's ability to perform well in the class. On the other hand, not studying for the test means that the student is not adequately prepared for the material covered on the exam, which could result in a poor grade and ultimately lead to failing the class."}}
{"Q": "In 1989, our company started using personal computers. Which event could cause When she got her pc later she did not know how to use it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) we bought the owners grandmother a new pc. (B) Our founder Rachel only uses the PC.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that the company started using personal computers in 1989 does not necessarily mean that every employee received one at the same time. It is more plausible that Rachel, as the founder, was the first to start using a PC and therefore had more experience with it. This would explain why the person in question did not know how to use it when she received it later."}}
{"Q": "Mary doesn't like cold weather. Which event could cause At least until she can afford to move to warmer state?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary wears two jackets. (B) It seemed that the cold weather stopped for two months.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It seemed that the cold weather stopped for two months.\nExplanation: Wearing two jackets may provide some temporary relief, but it is not a long-term solution. Moving to a warmer state is also not an immediate option. Therefore, the most plausible event that could provide some relief for Mary is a break in the cold weather for a period of time. This would allow her to enjoy some warmer temperatures until she can make a more permanent change."}}
{"Q": "Amy and her friends were out at 3 AM. Which event could cause They stayed there breathing hard, and praying they hadn't been seen?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They started getting followed by a policeman, ran, and hid behind a building. (B) The decided to break into the football field. When suddenly they saw a flashlight comming towards them. They all started running for the bleachers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that they were being followed by a policeman and had to hide, rather than randomly deciding to break into a football field and getting caught. Additionally, the fear of being seen by a policeman would explain why they were breathing hard and praying they hadn't been seen."}}
{"Q": "Bob's parents grounded him. Which event could cause He came back home but his parents didn't even know he left?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob got caught sneaking out. (B) Bob got away with sneaking out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Bob got away with sneaking out.\nExplanation: If Bob got caught sneaking out, it is unlikely that his parents would not know he left. However, if Bob got away with sneaking out, he could have left and returned without his parents noticing, leading to them grounding him without realizing he had already left the house."}}
{"Q": "Amy worked in the stockroom at Marshall's. Which event could cause Amy decided she would push herself to meet her new quota?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy won an award for how much work she accomplished and was given the same quota. (B) Amy's boss said she needed to do more.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Amy's boss telling her she needed to do more would cause her to push herself to meet her new quota, rather than winning an award and being given the same quota. When given a challenge or directive from a superior, it is common for employees to strive to meet or exceed expectations."}}
{"Q": "Jason had always admired the fast movements of boxers he saw on TV. Which event could cause He won his first fight by knockout?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He didn't let his inspiration go to waste, he trained and trained. (B) Jason learned to knit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He didn't let his inspiration go to waste, he trained and trained.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Jason's admiration for boxers and his desire to emulate their fast movements led him to train hard and improve his skills, eventually resulting in his first knockout victory. Learning to knit, on the other hand, has no direct correlation to boxing and would not likely lead to a knockout victory."}}
{"Q": "Erin tried to learn how to draw. Which event could cause So she joined a drawing class?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Erin, practiced drawing at home with no luck. (B) Erin, practiced drawing at home and became recognized for her talent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Erin, practiced drawing at home with no luck.\nExplanation: If Erin was not successful in learning how to draw on her own, it would make sense for her to seek out a drawing class for guidance and instruction. Option B suggests that Erin became recognized for her talent, which would not necessarily motivate her to join a class."}}
{"Q": "Jon decided to steal a police car. Which event could cause Jon went to prison for three years?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jon crashed the police car into a telephone poll. (B) Jon wasn't caught.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Jon crashed the police car into a telephone poll, he would likely be caught and charged with stealing a police car and causing damage to public property. This would result in a prison sentence of three years or more, depending on the severity of the damage and any injuries caused. On the other hand, if Jon wasn't caught, he would not face any consequences and would not go to prison."}}
{"Q": "I used to procrastinate about studying. Which event could cause Now, I never procrastinate studying?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I failed a big test. (B) After getting a good grade, I learned an easy lesson.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Failing a big test can be a wake-up call and a motivation to change one's study habits. It can make a person realize the consequences of procrastination and the importance of studying regularly. On the other hand, getting a good grade without much effort may not necessarily teach the lesson of discipline and hard work. Therefore, failing a big test is a more plausible event that could cause a change in study habits."}}
{"Q": "Jacob hated walking to school. Which event could cause Jacob was able to buy himself a used truck after 5 months of saving?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jacob decided to buy himself a car. (B) Jacob couldn't afford a car.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Jacob decided to buy himself a car.\nExplanation: If Jacob decided to buy himself a car, it would make sense that he saved up for it and was able to purchase a used truck after 5 months of saving. This event is more plausible than Jacob not being able to afford a car, as it is stated that he was able to buy one after saving for a period of time."}}
{"Q": "Roy went to the park to watch Little League baseball. Which event could cause The visiting team developed performance issues as a result?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He yelled at the players for every home run. (B) Roy made the other team uncomfortable.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Roy making the other team uncomfortable could cause them to develop performance issues as they may feel intimidated or distracted. Yelling at the players for every home run may not necessarily affect the visiting team's performance unless they were the ones hitting the home runs."}}
{"Q": "Stan started to feel sick at school one day. Which event could cause Stan finally recovered but said he wanted a flu shot from now on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Stan was out of school for a week with the stomach ache. (B) The school nurse sent Stan home from school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the school nurse sent Stan home, it is more likely that he was diagnosed with a contagious illness such as the flu. This experience may have prompted him to want to get a flu shot in the future to prevent getting sick again. On the other hand, being out of school for a week with a stomach ache could be caused by a variety of factors and may not necessarily lead to wanting a flu shot."}}
{"Q": "Lisa and Tim had been married for a long time. Which event could cause It worked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa and Tim went to a fertility clinic to get pregnant. (B) They decided to try the advice given in a book about guitar playing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They decided to try the advice given in a book about guitar playing.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that Lisa and Tim were able to work together and achieve a common goal, which could strengthen their relationship. Additionally, learning a new skill together can be a fun and rewarding experience, which could bring them closer together. On the other hand, going to a fertility clinic to get pregnant may not necessarily improve their relationship, and it is not guaranteed to work."}}
{"Q": "Adam loves to eat sandwiches when he drinks. Which event could cause Adam choked to death because he forgot to take off the cheese wrapper?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Adam made himself a sandwich using bread, turkey, and a slice of American cheese. (B) Adam made himself a pb&j sandwich.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: In choice A, Adam used a slice of American cheese which typically comes wrapped in plastic. If he forgot to take off the wrapper before eating the sandwich, he could potentially choke on the plastic and suffocate. Choice B, a pb&j sandwich, does not typically involve any plastic wrapping that could cause choking."}}
{"Q": "Tom was painting his fence. Which event could cause Tom left his fence half painted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom got tired of painting after he finished. (B) Tom heard a game was on and left.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom heard about a game and left his painting halfway done, as it is a common distraction and can be a tempting reason to stop working on a task. Getting tired of painting after finishing is less likely to cause someone to leave a task halfway done."}}
{"Q": "Amy decided to move from Wisconsin to Florida. Which event could cause However the experience was no fun without her friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She would be with her friends out there. (B) Amy wanted to live by the beadch.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) She would be with her friends out there.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the statement mentions that the experience was no fun without her friends, implying that Amy values her friendships and enjoys spending time with them. Therefore, it is more likely that she would want to be with her friends in Florida rather than just living by the beach."}}
{"Q": "Roger wanted to play tennis as well as Roger Federer. Which event could cause No one ever told Roger all his balls never landed in the court?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Roger overslept and lounged most the day. (B) Roger tried but he wasn't as good as his idol.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Roger tried but he wasn't as good as his idol.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Roger's lack of skill and ability to play tennis at the same level as Roger Federer would cause him to not realize that his balls were not landing in the court. If he overslept and lounged most of the day, he wouldn't have had the opportunity to play tennis and therefore wouldn't have realized his mistake."}}
{"Q": "Julie had a coworker named Barry who loved to make trouble for others. Which event could cause Julie was incredibly embarrassed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Barry did not tell anyone that Julie farted. (B) Barry laughed at Julie's unzipped pants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Barry laughed at Julie's unzipped pants.\nExplanation: While passing gas is a natural bodily function, having one's pants unzipped can be seen as a more embarrassing situation. Additionally, Barry's tendency to make trouble for others suggests that he would find amusement in embarrassing Julie in this way."}}
{"Q": "Bob decided to hike in the jungles of Indonesia. Which event could cause Bob had also forgotten his shoes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob stopped in the middle of the hike because he had no bug spray. (B) Bob stopped in the middle of his hike to tie his shoes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bob forgot his shoes because he did not have bug spray, which is a necessary item for hiking in the jungle to avoid insect bites and diseases. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Bob would forget his shoes and only realize it in the middle of the hike when he needs to tie them."}}
{"Q": "Lucy got all her friends together for a pizza party. Which event could cause When the pizzas were done, they had a taste and were delicious?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy decided to make the pizzas at home. (B) Lucy started ordering the pizza.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Lucy ordered the pizza from a reputable pizzeria, it is more likely that the pizzas would taste delicious. However, if she made them at home, there is a chance that they may not have turned out as well. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It was a very windy day. Which event could cause Jim wished he hadn't gone out in his new hat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim found his new hat in a storm. (B) Jim's hat blew away in the wind.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jim's hat blew away in the wind.\nExplanation: Since it was a very windy day, it is more likely that Jim's hat blew away in the wind rather than him finding his new hat in a storm. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Trevor went to the lake one day to fish. Which event could cause Trevor was forced to go home after he lost his fishing pole?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The water was perfect for all levels of fishing. (B) The water was spitting up poles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The water was spitting up poles.\nExplanation: If the water was spitting up poles, it is likely that Trevor's fishing pole was also lost due to this phenomenon. This would be a plausible reason for him to be forced to go home, as he would not be able to continue fishing without a pole. Option (A) does not provide a reason for Trevor to go home, as it suggests that the water was perfect for fishing."}}
{"Q": "My sister lived at the top of a highrise apartment. Which event could cause I realized I was afraid of such massive heights and I fainted?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I went to visit her and stepped out onto the balcony of her apartment with a great view. (B) I looked down from her balcony to see the clouds.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Stepping out onto the balcony with a great view would be a more plausible event to trigger a fear of heights and fainting, as it involves physically being in a high place and looking down. Looking at the clouds from the safety of the balcony would not necessarily cause the same level of fear and physical reaction."}}
{"Q": "Allister was practicing her with her bow. Which event could cause It ended up coming straight down and landing on the instructor's foot?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Allister was still a novice at the bow. (B) Allister was a pro at the bow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Allister was still a novice at the bow.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a novice would have less control over their bow and accidentally release an arrow in an unintended direction, such as straight down. A pro would have more experience and control over their bow, making it less likely for such an accident to occur."}}
{"Q": "Billy was going to have his boss over for dinner. Which event could cause He was still vacuuming when his boss arrived?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Billy played games and forgot about cleaning until 5PM. (B) Billy got home from work early.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Billy got home from work early.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if Billy got home from work early, he would have had less time to clean before his boss arrived. It is possible that he was still vacuuming when his boss arrived because he was trying to finish cleaning before the scheduled dinner time. On the other hand, if Billy played games and forgot about cleaning until 5PM, he would have had plenty of time to clean before his boss arrived and it would be less likely that he was still vacuuming when his boss arrived."}}
{"Q": "Maya was walking alongside a river, looking for frogs. Which event could cause Luckily, she was able to get back up and walk home safely?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She ended up falling into the river. (B) Maya slipped on some rocks and broke her back.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Falling into the river is a plausible event that could happen while walking alongside a river. However, breaking her back from slipping on rocks seems less likely and more severe, making it less plausible for her to be able to walk home safely."}}
{"Q": "Susan was making a soup. Which event could cause She did her best to cut away the bad parts?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She had to put in some broth. (B) She had to put in some chicken.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. She had to put in some chicken.\nExplanation: If Susan was making a soup with chicken, it would be necessary for her to cut away any bad parts of the chicken before adding it to the soup. Adding broth alone would not require cutting away bad parts."}}
{"Q": "Lulu felt so preoccupied lately. Which event could cause But she was prepared to send her because the school was excellent?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lulu's daughter was going to go to school for the first time. (B) Lulu's mom was thinking of sending her to a new house despite her objections.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lulu's daughter was going to go to school for the first time.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause preoccupation for Lulu as it involves her child's education and well-being. Sending a child to school for the first time can be a big step for both the child and the parent, and it is understandable that Lulu may feel preoccupied about it. On the other hand, the second option of Lulu's mom thinking of sending her to a new house does not directly involve Lulu's own life and decisions, and therefore may not be as likely to cause preoccupation for her."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to create a video game. Which event could cause Indeed, Java was terrible for programming video games?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I programmed with Java for robot game. (B) I programmed with Java for robot game because it was easy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Programming for a robot game may not require the same level of graphics and real-time processing as a video game. Therefore, Java's limitations for video game programming may become more apparent when attempting to create a more complex and visually appealing game."}}
{"Q": "My best friend got married and moved to Hawaii. Which event could cause We celebrated for days and I left for home at the end of the week?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My best friend visited me on a vacation. (B) I went with her to celebrate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that \"we celebrated for days\" which implies that the speaker was present during the celebration. Also, the statement mentions \"I left for home at the end of the week\" which suggests that the speaker was away from home for a week. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker went with her friend to Hawaii to celebrate her wedding rather than her friend visiting the speaker on a vacation."}}
{"Q": "Tom went to an electronics store to buy earphones. Which event could cause Tom decided to always buy more expensive ear phones?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was an elitist. (B) Tom bought costly ones but they broke right away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Tom bought costly earphones but they broke right away, he may assume that cheaper earphones are not durable and may not provide good sound quality. This could lead him to believe that more expensive earphones are worth the investment for better quality and longevity. On the other hand, there is no evidence to suggest that Tom is an elitist, so option (A) is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Kaya needed to buy a new dress for the upcoming Spring Formal. Which event could cause She couldn't resist so she bought the antique vase?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At the store, Kaya saw a very beautiful vase. (B) Kaya could not find a single thing at the store,.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) At the store, Kaya saw a very beautiful vase.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Kaya was tempted by something she saw while shopping for a dress, which is a common occurrence. It is more likely that Kaya would be distracted by a beautiful vase than not finding anything at all. Additionally, the fact that the vase is described as \"antique\" suggests that it may have been a unique and valuable find, making it even harder for Kaya to resist."}}
{"Q": "Sam came home to find water all over his kitchen floor. Which event could cause Sam restocked his new fridge with all his favorite food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam put a towel under the leaky fridge. (B) Sam dishwasher broke and was leaking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sam's dishwasher broke and was leaking.\nExplanation: If Sam's dishwasher broke and was leaking, it could have caused water to spread all over the kitchen floor. This event would also make sense for Sam to restock his new fridge with all his favorite food, as he may have had to clean out his old fridge due to water damage from the dishwasher leak. Putting a towel under a leaky fridge may help contain the water, but it would not necessarily lead to restocking the fridge with food."}}
{"Q": "Anna had a bad headache. Which event could cause Thankfully, when she awoke, the headache was gone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anna took a few asprins and laid down and took a nap. (B) She went to a concert to get rid of it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Anna took a few aspirins and laid down and took a nap.\nExplanation: Aspirin is a common pain reliever and can help alleviate headaches. Rest and sleep can also help reduce headache symptoms. Going to a concert is unlikely to help with a headache and may even make it worse due to loud noises and bright lights."}}
{"Q": "Last night I had a dream about biking. Which event could cause I woke up, bitterly disappointed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) my dream was very real and I was on a fun bike tour. (B) I actually have a bike.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the dream was very real and enjoyable, it is more likely that the disappointment would come from waking up and realizing it was just a dream. Having a bike in real life may not necessarily lead to disappointment upon waking up from a dream about biking."}}
{"Q": "It was starting to get late outside. Which event could cause Her parents grounded her for a week for being late?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She forgot what time it was and was home late. (B) She was supposed to be home an hour after she arrived.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that she simply forgot what time it was and was home late, rather than intentionally staying out an hour longer than she was supposed to. Forgetting the time is a common mistake, while purposefully disobeying her parents' rules would likely result in a more severe punishment than just being grounded for a week."}}
{"Q": "Kim wanted to buy a car. Which event could cause Kim was hired to a job and saved enough money for her car?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kim needed more money than she could get. (B) Kim applied for jobs to make money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Kim applied for jobs to make money.\nExplanation: If Kim applied for jobs and was hired, she would have a source of income to save up for her car. This is a more plausible event than Kim needing more money than she could get, as it implies that Kim was actively working towards her goal of buying a car."}}
{"Q": "Joe was running late for school. Which event could cause Joe had a tasty, healthy breakfast of apples and bananas?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe had plenty of time to cook something. (B) Joe didn't have time to cook something.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Joe didn't have time to cook something.\nExplanation: If Joe was running late for school, it is more plausible that he didn't have enough time to cook something and opted for a quick and easy breakfast of apples and bananas."}}
{"Q": "Tim needed a fruit to eat. Which event could cause Finally, he found some fresh grapes to eat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He went to the near by super market. (B) Tim looked for a long time in the messy fridge.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tim looked for a long time in the messy fridge.\nExplanation: Since Tim needed a fruit to eat and he found fresh grapes, it is more plausible that he searched for it in his fridge rather than going to a nearby supermarket. The fact that the fridge was messy suggests that he had to search for a while before finding the grapes."}}
{"Q": "Gina's mom had taken a rap tape from her kids. Which event could cause He stood smiling as his tape was smashed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The rap tape was mean and rude. (B) Gina  take their new tape.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Gina take their new tape.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gina took her siblings' new tape as revenge for her mom taking her rap tape. This would cause the siblings to be upset and angry, leading to one of them standing and smiling as their tape was smashed. Option (A) is less likely as it does not explain why the tape was smashed or why someone would be smiling about it."}}
{"Q": "Kelly loves to eat sweet desserts. Which event could cause We all ate the brownie sundae for dessert?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We ordered a dessert everyone would like. (B) We ordered appetizers everyone would like.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. We ordered a dessert everyone would like.\nExplanation: Since Kelly loves sweet desserts, it is likely that the group would choose a dessert that would appeal to her taste. Ordering a dessert that everyone would like would increase the chances of Kelly enjoying the brownie sundae and the group finishing it for dessert. Ordering appetizers would not necessarily have an impact on the dessert choice."}}
{"Q": "Ora had always been overweight. Which event could cause With their help, Ora lost over twenty pounds?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ora decided to eat healthy for a month. (B) Ora decided she wanted to maintainer her weight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Ora decided to eat healthy for a month.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a sustained effort to eat healthy over a period of time would result in significant weight loss, rather than simply deciding to maintain one's weight. Additionally, the fact that Ora had always been overweight suggests that a more significant change in behavior would be necessary to achieve weight loss."}}
{"Q": "Priya decided to try a new restaurant. Which event could cause Priya thought her food was delicious?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She ordered two shrimp dishes. (B) The food that Priya ordered was microwaved and precooked.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) She ordered two shrimp dishes.\nExplanation: If Priya ordered two shrimp dishes and found them to be delicious, it is a more plausible answer as shrimp is a popular and tasty dish. On the other hand, if the food was microwaved and precooked, it is less likely to be delicious as it may have lost its flavor and texture during the reheating process."}}
{"Q": "Jamie and Candice were going on a date. Which event could cause Finally, they settled on ice cream?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jamie and Candice did not know what movie to see. (B) Jamie and Candice couldn't decide what to do.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jamie and Candice couldn't decide what to do.\nExplanation: If Jamie and Candice couldn't decide what to do, they may have suggested getting ice cream as a compromise or a fun activity they both enjoy. It is less likely that their indecision about a movie would lead them to settle on ice cream as a date activity."}}
{"Q": "Scott has felt increasingly unhappy in his last few Year's in New York. Which event could cause Driving out of New York, Scott feels both relieved and nostalgic?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Scott found a job in New York. (B) The daily grind, extreme traffic and rude city dwellers left Scott longing for small town living.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The daily grind, extreme traffic and rude city dwellers left Scott longing for small town living.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it explains why Scott was unhappy in New York and why he felt relieved to leave. It also explains why he felt nostalgic, as he may have had some positive experiences in New York despite the negative aspects. Option (A) does not provide a reason for Scott's unhappiness or his mixed emotions upon leaving."}}
{"Q": "I went to the store one day to buy clothes. Which event could cause I went home and the jeans fit much better?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I got larger sizes. (B) I bought jeans thought they were a bit expensive.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) I got larger sizes.\nExplanation: If the person got larger sizes, it is possible that the jeans fit better because they were not too tight or uncomfortable. It is also possible that the person tried on different sizes and found the perfect fit. On the other hand, buying expensive jeans (option B) does not necessarily guarantee a better fit."}}
{"Q": "Sam was on a date with her boyfriend. Which event could cause When her boyfriend asked if she wanted to hang out, she yelled at him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They ran into a cute friend of Sam's on the way to dinner. (B) The date went bad, they went home on good terms.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Sam ran into a cute friend on the way to dinner, she may have felt embarrassed or self-conscious in front of her boyfriend and reacted by yelling at him. This scenario is more plausible than the date going bad and them going home on good terms, as it doesn't make sense for Sam to suddenly yell at her boyfriend if everything was going well."}}
{"Q": "Pam does surveys daily to try to win prizes on Survey Monkey. Which event could cause Pam did not seem to think there was anything wrong with that?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Pam tried her best to be as honest as possible. (B) Pam wasted time with doing her surveys.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Pam tried her best to be as honest as possible.\nExplanation: Since Pam is doing surveys to win prizes, it is important for her to be honest in her responses. If she is not honest, she may not qualify for the prizes or may be disqualified later on. Therefore, it is reasonable for Pam to try her best to be as honest as possible while doing the surveys. This event would not cause Pam to think there was anything wrong with doing surveys daily."}}
{"Q": "Lydia had a strange dream last night. Which event could cause Lydia wished the dream were real?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) In Lydia's dream, she was poor and lonely. (B) In Lydia's dream, she was rich and famous.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) In Lydia's dream, she was rich and famous.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Lydia would wish her dream were real if she was rich and famous, as this is often seen as a desirable state. Being poor and lonely, as in option (A), is generally not something people would want to experience in real life. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Dana always wanted to ride a bike. Which event could cause They were riding around together within minutes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dana asked a neighbor to ride with her. (B) Her friend asked Dana to teach her how to ride.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Dana asked a neighbor to ride with her.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it implies that Dana already knows how to ride a bike and has access to one. By asking a neighbor to ride with her, it suggests that the neighbor also has a bike and is willing to ride with Dana. This scenario would allow them to start riding together within minutes. On the other hand, option B suggests that Dana would have to teach her friend how to ride, which could take a significant amount of time and may not result in them riding together within minutes."}}
{"Q": "Kelly wanted to try out for soccer this year. Which event could cause Kelly celebrated by getting pizza?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly tried out for the soccer team but was cut. (B) Kelly made it onto the team.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Kelly made it onto the team.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Kelly would celebrate with pizza if she made it onto the team rather than being cut from the team. Making the team is a positive outcome and a reason to celebrate, while being cut would likely be disappointing and not a cause for celebration."}}
{"Q": "Tom was excited to use his new gas grill. Which event could cause Tom's garage and grill were both destroyed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom didn't check the grills gas. (B) Tom didn't check the grill's safety.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Tom didn't check the grill's gas, there could be a gas leak that could cause an explosion, which could destroy both the garage and the grill. Checking the grill's safety would not necessarily prevent this specific event from happening."}}
{"Q": "Martin went to camp with his friends. Which event could cause Martin caught many fish so that everyone could eat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Martins friends went fishing without martin. (B) He was the best fisherman of the group.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He was the best fisherman of the group.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Martin's fishing skills were the reason for catching many fish. If his friends went fishing without him, it would not explain how Martin caught many fish. Therefore, option (B) is a more logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "Sam was excited to get his car washed. Which event could cause He had forgotten to close the window in all the excitement?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) After the car wash Sam noticed his car seats were all soaking wet. (B) He rolled up all his windows and began daydreaming of how well his car would look after the wash.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Sam had forgotten to close the window, it is more likely that his car seats would be soaking wet after the car wash. Option (B) suggests that he had already rolled up all his windows, so forgetting to close one window would not have caused any noticeable damage."}}
{"Q": "May really wanted to go to the concert that was playing next week. Which event could cause A kind reader wrote back to offer her two free tickets to the concert?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) May sent out tweets looking for tickets. (B) So she bought 2 tickets online.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: May's desire to go to the concert is established in the first sentence. Option A is more plausible because May actively sought out tickets by sending out tweets, which could have caught the attention of a kind reader who offered her two free tickets. Option B is less likely because if May had already bought tickets, she would not need someone to offer her free tickets."}}
{"Q": "Mindy decided to go over jake's house. Which event could cause She panicked and ran screaming out of his house?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When Mindy walked in the door, Jake was naked. (B) Mindy scared Jake when she came into the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Walking into someone's house and finding them naked is a more plausible reason for someone to panic and run screaming out of the house than simply scaring the person. It is a shocking and unexpected event that could cause Mindy to feel uncomfortable and unsafe in Jake's presence."}}
{"Q": "I was having trouble finding my comfortable slippers. Which event could cause Finders keepers, she told me?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The dog stole the slippers. (B) My sister stole my slippers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The dog stole the slippers.\nExplanation: Finders keepers is a common phrase used when someone finds something that was lost or abandoned. In this scenario, if the dog stole the slippers and hid them somewhere, whoever finds them first can claim them as their own (hence, finders keepers). On the other hand, if the sister stole the slippers, it would be considered theft and not a matter of finders keepers."}}
{"Q": "I did not like the color of my lips. Which event could cause Over time, people at school accepted me for the person I wished to be?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I used a marker to paint them bright pink. (B) I wanted to have normal lips. I painted them red and people liked it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I wanted to have normal lips. I painted them red and people liked it.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that painting the lips a more natural color like red would be more accepted by others than painting them an unnatural bright pink with a marker. Additionally, the statement about being accepted for who they wished to be suggests that the change in lip color was a part of a larger effort to express themselves authentically, rather than just a random decision to change their appearance."}}
{"Q": "A family went shopping together. Which event could cause The father bought the boy a new computer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Their son was very well behaved. (B) The boy needed a new cell phone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The boy needed a new computer.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the father bought the boy a new computer because he needed it, rather than just because he was well behaved. Additionally, the fact that they went shopping together suggests that they were likely looking for specific items, such as a new computer for the boy. The option about needing a new cell phone is not relevant to the purchase of a computer."}}
{"Q": "I was working on my laptop one day. Which event could cause After paying the bill, I no longer experienced issues?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) i got an e-mail saying my cable bill was current and service would be upgraded. (B) The internet was very slow and then stopped completely.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since the question mentions paying a bill, it is more likely that the issue was related to internet service. Option A suggests that the bill was paid and service was upgraded, which could have resolved the issue. Option B suggests that the internet stopped completely, which would not have been resolved simply by paying a bill."}}
{"Q": "Isa was getting married but couldn't afford a bouquet. Which event could cause Isa ended up with a beautiful hand picked bouquet?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Isa went to the country site and found some flowers. (B) Isa forgot about the bouquet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Isa went to the country site and found some flowers.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Isa would go out of her way to find flowers for her wedding rather than forgetting about the bouquet altogether. Additionally, going to the countryside to pick flowers is a common and cost-effective way to create a beautiful bouquet."}}
{"Q": "There is a beaver that has been building a dam by our school. Which event could cause The beaver decided to leave the area and went further down stream?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People destroyed the dam the beaver was building. (B) Everyone was all over the hotel, trying to see him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Beavers are known to be very territorial and protective of their dams. If people were to destroy the dam the beaver was building, it would be a threat to the beaver's territory and could cause it to leave the area in search of a safer location. On the other hand, people being interested in seeing the beaver would not necessarily cause it to leave, as long as they were not disturbing its habitat or causing any harm."}}
{"Q": "My family was on vacation in Italy. Which event could cause It was our favorite picture of the vacation?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We took a beautiful picture of Spain. (B) We took a photo next to the coliseum in Rome.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) We took a photo next to the coliseum in Rome.\nExplanation: Since the family was on vacation in Italy, it is more plausible that a picture taken in Italy would be their favorite. The coliseum is a famous landmark in Rome and a popular tourist destination, so it is likely that the family enjoyed visiting it and taking a photo there."}}
{"Q": "I told Bill not to go to Lansing. Which event could cause He got in an accident on the highway, he should of listened?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) bill said he would be fine and left. (B) Bill went to Lansing via air anyways.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Bill said he would be fine and left, it implies that he went to Lansing by car despite being warned not to. This makes it more likely that he got in an accident on the highway and should have listened to the warning. On the other hand, if he went to Lansing via air anyways, it would not have put him at risk of getting in an accident on the highway."}}
{"Q": "Liv wanted to dance ballet. Which event could cause Liv's classmates her so jealous and shocked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Liv's mother signed her up. (B) She was not very talented.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She was not very talented.\nExplanation: If Liv's classmates were jealous and shocked, it would most likely be because they believed Liv was not very talented but still managed to get a spot in the ballet class. This would make them feel like Liv was taking away a spot that could have gone to someone more deserving. If Liv's mother signed her up, it would not necessarily cause jealousy or shock among her classmates."}}
{"Q": "A little boy sick in a hospital worshiped a famous basketball player. Which event could cause Standing in front of the coffee shop was the ball player?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) One day a nurse said they should go to the coffee shop for a treat. (B) The baseball player looked out the window at a coffee shop.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The baseball player looked out the window at a coffee shop.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the basketball player happened to be at the coffee shop and the little boy saw him through the window, rather than a nurse randomly suggesting they go to the coffee shop and the basketball player being there at the same time."}}
{"Q": "Jake was off roading. Which event could cause He had to get help to get out?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jake ended up getting free from the mud. (B) Jake got stuff in the mud.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jake got stuck in the mud and couldn't get out on his own, it is more likely that he needed help to get out. Option A suggests that he was able to get free from the mud on his own, which would not require him to get help. Option B suggests that he got something stuck in the mud, which could have caused him to get stuck and need assistance to get out."}}
{"Q": "I got a new racing game yesterday. Which event could cause Finally after hours of playing I stopped?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was so fun, I was a clown. (B) I sat down to test out the game.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I sat down to test out the game.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the reason for stopping playing the game after hours of playing is due to exhaustion or needing a break, rather than becoming a clown from having too much fun. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Freda is the boss of her office. Which event could cause Freda can't understand why people have a problem with her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She doesn't ask nicely to get things indefinite. (B) She doesn't ask nicely to get things done.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She doesn't ask nicely to get things done.\nExplanation: If Freda doesn't ask nicely to get things done, it could cause people to have a problem with her because they may feel disrespected or undervalued. As the boss, it's important for Freda to communicate effectively and respectfully with her employees to maintain a positive work environment. If she is not doing so, it could lead to tension and conflict. On the other hand, option (A) is not as plausible because it is unclear what \"things indefinite\" means and it is not a common phrase or situation in the workplace."}}
{"Q": "Carly had just called her kids in from playing outside. Which event could cause Then, she put some medicated lotion on her and hoped it would pass?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One of them had a bad cough. (B) Carly, noticed her daughter had gotten into Poison Ivy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that Carly put medicated lotion on herself suggests that she may have also noticed her daughter had gotten into Poison Ivy, which would require treatment. A bad cough would not require medicated lotion, so option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Alexis had cut down a Christmas tree in the woods. Which event could cause When she put it up, it was the right size for her ceiling?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alexis made sure the tree wasn't under 20 feet tall. (B) Alexis was worried it would be too big.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Alexis made sure the tree wasn't under 20 feet tall.\nExplanation: If Alexis had made sure the tree wasn't under 20 feet tall, then it is more likely that the tree would fit in her ceiling. If the tree was too tall, she would have had to cut it down to size, which would have been mentioned in the question. Option B suggests that Alexis was worried the tree would be too big, but it doesn't explain how the tree ended up being the right size for her ceiling."}}
{"Q": "Francine had always dreamed of being a fashion designer. Which event could cause She was so proud that she followed her dreams?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Francine decided to go to school to pursue her dreams. (B) francine applied to business school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Francine decided to go to school to pursue her dreams.\nExplanation: Pursuing her dreams by going to school shows that Francine is taking concrete steps towards achieving her goal of becoming a fashion designer. This decision demonstrates her commitment and determination to follow her passion, which would make her proud of herself. Applying to business school, on the other hand, may not necessarily align with her dream of becoming a fashion designer and may not evoke the same sense of pride."}}
{"Q": "Jack went to his first basketball game with his dad. Which event could cause As the crowd cheered, Jack knew they'd never forget his first game?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack caught a ball that bounced over the fence. (B) Jack saw how wild the crowd was getting.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the excitement and energy of the crowd would leave a lasting impression on Jack, rather than him catching a ball that bounced over the fence. The experience of being part of a passionate crowd at a live sporting event is often a memorable one, especially for someone attending their first game."}}
{"Q": "Nathan bullied a lot of other boys at school. Which event could cause Nathan knew his violence would never prevent his own abuse?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nathan never got into a fight. (B) Nathan got detention in school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Nathan never got into a fight, it is more likely that he realized his violence would never prevent his own abuse through some other means, such as observing the consequences of violence in others or through therapy or counseling. Getting detention in school may not necessarily lead to this realization."}}
{"Q": "Mike made homemade pasta one day. Which event could cause Pasta is now a regular staple of Mike's diet?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike found pasta hard to make. (B) Mile loves italian food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Mike loves Italian food.\nExplanation: If Mike loves Italian food, it is more likely that he will continue to make and eat pasta regularly. Enjoying the taste and variety of Italian cuisine would be a stronger motivator than finding pasta difficult to make."}}
{"Q": "Randy's friend gave him directions to his house. Which event could cause Randy told his friend how relieved he was he found it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Randy knew the area well. (B) He didn't know that part of town very good.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He didn't know that part of town very well.\nExplanation: If Randy didn't know that part of town very well, it would make sense for him to feel relieved when he found his friend's house. On the other hand, if Randy knew the area well, he would not have had much trouble finding his friend's house and would not have felt relieved."}}
{"Q": "Cay had a crush on a boy in her class. Which event could cause He smiled at her after and said he liked her too?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cat sent a love note to the boy. (B) She told him she did not like him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Sending a love note to the boy would indicate to him that Cay has feelings for him, which could prompt him to smile and confess his own feelings. On the other hand, telling him she did not like him would likely result in him not reciprocating her feelings and not smiling at her."}}
{"Q": "Lacy and Karen got in a fight. Which event could cause Karen apologized too so they could be friends again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Karen missed Lacy so much, she couldn't bear not talking to her friend. (B) Lacy missed Karen so much, she couldn't bear not talking to her friend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Karen missed Lacy so much, she couldn't bear not talking to her friend.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it shows that Karen is taking responsibility for her actions and is willing to apologize to Lacy in order to repair their friendship. It also shows that Karen values their friendship and wants to make things right, which is a positive step towards reconciliation. Option B puts the burden solely on Lacy to reach out and make amends, which may not be fair or realistic."}}
{"Q": "My friend had an announcement to make. Which event could cause So, I put on a smile and wished him the best of luck?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My friend told us he had cancer and was expected to die in a week. (B) my friend usually talks about some business deal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the announcement is related to a business deal, as it is a common topic of discussion among friends. The announcement of cancer and impending death is a serious and somber event, which would not be appropriate to respond to with just a smile and well wishes."}}
{"Q": "George was about to participate in his first professional fight. Which event could cause George proved his skills and won his first match?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) George trained hard for two days before the fight. (B) George was the underdog, but he had been training months to compete in this event.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that George's months of training would have prepared him better for the fight than just two days of hard training. Being the underdog also adds to the excitement and drama of the match, making it more likely that George's victory would be seen as a testament to his skills and determination."}}
{"Q": "Bob and his kids love football. Which event could cause Bob and his kids share a hug to celebrate the win?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The team that Bob and his kids like won. (B) They played basketball out back all afternoon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The team that Bob and his kids like won.\nExplanation: Since Bob and his kids love football, it is more plausible that they would share a hug to celebrate the win of their favorite team rather than playing basketball out back all afternoon. Winning a game that they are passionate about would bring them joy and excitement, which could lead to a celebratory hug."}}
{"Q": "Alex was at target with his mom. Which event could cause He begged his mother to buy it until she gave in?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He didn't see the toy he really wanted in any of the aisles. (B) Alex saw a game he really wanted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Alex saw a game he really wanted, it is more likely that he would beg his mother to buy it until she gave in. Seeing a toy he really wanted in any of the aisles may not necessarily lead to begging his mother to buy it."}}
{"Q": "Nova dreamed of being a professional dancer. Which event could cause Nova's second choice accepted her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nova applied to a few dance schools but was denied by her first choice. (B) Nova applied to one dance school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Nova's first choice denied her, it is possible that she applied to other dance schools and was accepted by her second choice. This shows that she is determined to pursue her dream and is willing to explore other options. On the other hand, if she only applied to one dance school and was denied, it is less likely that her second choice would accept her without any other factors involved."}}
{"Q": "Carla and Sam spent the morning building a sand castle. Which event could cause The tide had rolled in, smashing it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) An unexpected event happened when the tide didn't come in that day. (B) The sand castle was built right on the shore.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If the sand castle was built right on the shore, it is likely that the tide would eventually come in and wash it away. This is a common occurrence when building sand castles on the beach. On the other hand, if the tide didn't come in that day (choice A), it wouldn't have caused the sand castle to be smashed. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tami was in the 8th grade. Which event could cause Tami made up her mind to try out for the JV Volleyball team?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She wanted to be less involved and lose friends. (B) Tami was tall for her age.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tami being tall for her age is a more plausible reason for her to try out for the JV Volleyball team as height is an advantage in volleyball. Option A, wanting to be less involved and lose friends, does not make sense as it goes against the idea of joining a team and being part of a group."}}
{"Q": "Donald is running for president. Which event could cause Hopefully he loses the election?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Donald is a selfless, wonderful person. (B) Donald is not the candidate I want for president.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is based on personal preference and opinion, which can greatly influence voting decisions. If a significant number of voters share the same opinion, it could lead to Donald losing the election. On the other hand, option A is unlikely to cause him to lose the election as being a selfless and wonderful person may actually attract more voters."}}
{"Q": "I was very out of shape. Which event could cause After weeks of jumping rope, I began to feel excellent?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had rope that I used for jumping at home. (B) I committed to exercise every month by jumping rope.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Committing to exercise every month by jumping rope is a more plausible answer as it suggests a consistent effort towards improving fitness. Using a rope at home may not necessarily lead to feeling excellent as it depends on the frequency and intensity of the exercise."}}
{"Q": "Ora's mom told her that the family had a very high gas bill. Which event could cause Ora was unhappy, but she understood?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ora's family needed to use more gas. (B) Ora's mom kicked her out of the house so their gas bill would reduce.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Ora being unhappy but understanding suggests that there was a valid reason for the high gas bill. Option A suggests that the family needed to use more gas, which could be due to weather conditions or other factors beyond their control. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Ora's mom took extreme measures to reduce the gas bill, which is unlikely to be a reasonable or practical solution. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Some dog kept me awake till I could not take it anymore. Which event could cause I gave the puppy the food and I went back to bed, both of us happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The puppy was given to me by a stork. (B) I got up and tried to find out why they kept barking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I got up and tried to find out why they kept barking.\nExplanation: If the dog was keeping the person awake, it is likely that they would try to find a solution to the problem. Giving the puppy food may have helped to calm them down and stop barking, allowing both the person and the puppy to go back to sleep. Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it involves a fictional scenario."}}
{"Q": "Dan entered an eating contest at his local fair. Which event could cause Dan lost the contest, and was sick for days?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan ate a lot of food very slowly, hoping to win. (B) Dan tried to eat 30 cold hot dogs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Eating 30 cold hot dogs in a short amount of time could cause Dan to lose the contest and potentially get sick afterwards due to the large amount of food and the fact that they were cold, which could make them harder to digest. Eating slowly may not result in winning the contest, but it is less likely to cause Dan to get sick."}}
{"Q": "Melissa's friend was coming for a visit. Which event could cause Luckily, when Melissa pointed this out, her friend apologized?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Melissa was being rude. (B) Melissa's friend insisted they go out to eat somewhere Melissa hated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Melissa's friend insisted they go out to eat somewhere Melissa hated, it could cause tension or frustration between them. When Melissa pointed out the issue, her friend may have realized their mistake and apologized. This scenario seems more plausible than Melissa being rude for no reason, which would not necessarily prompt an apology from her friend."}}
{"Q": "Nell's teacher admired her artistic student. Which event could cause The teacher was impressed that Nell drew an X-ray of an animal?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nell studied biology to draw an animal. (B) Nell was told to do something unexpected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Nell studied biology to draw an animal.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Nell's teacher was impressed with her drawing of an X-ray of an animal because Nell had studied biology and had a better understanding of the animal's anatomy. This shows that Nell put in effort and research into her artwork, which would impress her teacher. On the other hand, option (B) is less likely as it does not necessarily relate to Nell's artistic abilities or her teacher's admiration for her work."}}
{"Q": "Eli didn't know how to tie his shoes. Which event could cause Eli learned and now ties like a pro?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His dad asked Eli how to tie his shoes. (B) eli asked his dad how to tie his shoes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Eli would ask his dad how to tie his shoes, as it is a common way for children to learn new skills. It is less likely that his dad would ask Eli how to tie his shoes, as it is typically the parent who teaches the child."}}
{"Q": "When Francine was a little girl, her favorite treat was cotton candy. Which event could cause She purchased a bag to share with her friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was anxious to buy some today. (B) Francine saw bananas for sale at the fair.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Seeing bananas for sale at the fair is not directly related to purchasing cotton candy, so it is less likely to be the cause of Francine buying a bag to share with her friends. However, if she was at a fair or carnival where cotton candy is commonly sold, seeing the bananas may have reminded her of her childhood favorite treat and prompted her to buy some to share with her friends."}}
{"Q": "Ben went to the beach on a sunny day. Which event could cause Ben crawled into his tent and napped?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben spent hours sitting in the sun. (B) Ben pitched a large tent on the sand to block out the sun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Ben spent hours sitting in the sun.\nExplanation: Sitting in the sun for hours can cause sunburn, dehydration, and exhaustion, which can make someone feel tired and want to take a nap. Pitching a large tent on the sand to block out the sun seems like a proactive measure to avoid getting too much sun, so it is less likely to be the cause of Ben's nap."}}
{"Q": "Tili wanted to escape from prison. Which event could cause Tili's escape attempt was stopped and punished?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tili ran for the prison gate one night. (B) Doug formulated a plan.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Tili running for the prison gate one night is a more plausible event that could cause her escape attempt to be stopped and punished. It is likely that there would be guards or security measures in place to prevent prisoners from escaping, and if Tili was caught attempting to escape, she would likely face punishment such as solitary confinement or additional time added to her sentence. On the other hand, Doug formulating a plan does not necessarily mean that Tili attempted to escape or that she was caught, so it is not a clear event that would result in punishment."}}
{"Q": "Sam had to pay off his credit card debt. Which event could cause Sam eventually made enough to pay off his credit card debt?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam lost his job and could not make the payment. (B) Sam decided to work two jobs to pay off his debt.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Sam decided to work two jobs to pay off his debt.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sam's decision to work two jobs would eventually lead to him making enough money to pay off his credit card debt. Losing his job would make it more difficult for him to make payments and could potentially lead to further financial struggles. Working two jobs, on the other hand, would increase his income and allow him to allocate more funds towards paying off his debt."}}
{"Q": "Katie had let her kitchen get pretty messy. Which event could cause She used bleach to be sure that it was clean and safe?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The kitchen got so bad mold might grow. (B) Katie needed to hurry and get it clean.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Katie's kitchen had gotten so bad that mold might grow, it would be important for her to use bleach to ensure that it was clean and safe. Mold can be harmful to one's health, so it is important to take steps to prevent it from growing in the kitchen. On the other hand, if Katie simply needed to hurry and get the kitchen clean, she may not have necessarily needed to use bleach specifically."}}
{"Q": "Randy's friend gave him directions to his house. Which event could cause Randy saw the house but kept on driving and didn't come back?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The directions took Randy thru a great part of town. (B) The house had boarded windows and looked bad.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The house had boarded windows and looked bad.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Randy saw the condition of the house and decided not to stop rather than being deterred by driving through a great part of town. Boarded windows and a run-down appearance could indicate that the neighborhood is unsafe or the house is abandoned, which could make Randy feel uncomfortable or unsafe."}}
{"Q": "I was driving on the highway when my car suddenly broke down. Which event could cause Turns out my insurance covered the tow truck and the rest was cheap?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was worried about how to tow. (B) I called my insurance company to see if I could get assistance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I called my insurance company to see if I could get assistance.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the event that caused the insurance coverage was the driver calling their insurance company for assistance, rather than simply worrying about how to tow the car. By calling the insurance company, the driver was able to utilize their coverage and receive assistance with the tow truck, resulting in a cheaper overall cost."}}
{"Q": "Tia was in college and went home for the holidays. Which event could cause Before she left her father told her that they were getting a divorce?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tia had dinner with her parents. (B) Tia thought something seemed good between her parents.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tia had dinner with her parents.\nExplanation: If Tia had dinner with her parents, it would be a plausible event for her father to tell her about the divorce before she left for college. It would also explain why Tia may have been upset or emotional during her visit home. On the other hand, option B does not seem plausible as it contradicts the fact that Tia's father had already told her about the divorce."}}
{"Q": "Joe's mother bugged him constantly to tie his shoelaces. Which event could cause As he lay at the bottom of the stairs he wished he'd listened?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe tripped down the stairs with his shoes untied. (B) Joe tied them and fell down the stairs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Joe's shoelaces were untied and he tripped down the stairs, it would be a logical consequence of not listening to his mother's advice to tie his shoelaces. On the other hand, if he tied his shoelaces and still fell down the stairs, it would not be related to his mother's advice and would not make sense in the context of the question."}}
{"Q": "Nita was playing rummy with her dad. Which event could cause Nita was so happy she finally beat her dad at rummy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nita practiced playing rummy with a dog. (B) Nita was never able to beat her Dad.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Nita was never able to beat her dad before, finally beating him would be a significant accomplishment and could cause her to feel very happy. Practicing with a dog would not necessarily lead to beating her dad, so option A is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Fred had a job at the fair to fill the balloons. Which event could cause The balloon popped in his face?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Fred saw a child come over with a pin. (B) Fred fill one balloon too small.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the balloon popped in Fred's face because a child came over with a pin, rather than Fred filling one balloon too small. Filling a balloon too small would not necessarily cause it to pop in his face, whereas a pin would easily puncture the balloon and cause it to pop. Additionally, it is common for children to be fascinated by balloons and want to play with them, including popping them with a pin."}}
{"Q": "Samantha's dad always taught her how to be self-sufficient. Which event could cause Samantha was very grateful to be able to get home safely?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Samantha found some friends who gave her a ride. (B) She had a flat tire and changed it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Samantha's dad taught her to be self-sufficient, it is more likely that she would be grateful for being able to change a flat tire and get home safely on her own, rather than relying on friends to give her a ride. This event would demonstrate her ability to handle unexpected situations and rely on her own skills, which aligns with her father's teachings."}}
{"Q": "I used my ruined treehouse to build a fort. Which event could cause The new fort is twice as good as the old treehouse?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The tree fell on my fort. (B) It was the right size.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the tree fell on the fort, it could have provided more materials for building and potentially stronger ones. This could result in a fort that is twice as good as the old treehouse. On the other hand, the size of the fort being right may not necessarily make it twice as good as the old treehouse."}}
{"Q": "Mike had to go to the doctor. Which event could cause All the blood work came back clear and he was relieved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike was having blood drawn because he needed a routine checkup. (B) Mike complained of soreness in his kidneys.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Mike was having blood drawn for a routine checkup, it is more likely that all the blood work would come back clear and he would feel relieved. On the other hand, if he complained of soreness in his kidneys, it is possible that the blood work could reveal a problem or issue, causing him to feel anxious or worried. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Everyone thought it was funny that Rocky played hockey. Which event could cause Well, Rocket prefers the term Aerospace Engineer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rocky was very good at playing hockey. (B) Rocky was a rocket scientist, and he hated rockets.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Rocky was a rocket scientist, and he hated rockets.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it provides a reason for why Rocky would prefer the term Aerospace Engineer over being associated with rockets. It also adds a layer of irony to the situation, making it more humorous. If Rocky was very good at playing hockey, it wouldn't necessarily explain why people found it funny that he played hockey or why he prefers a different job title."}}
{"Q": "Arnold was scared of girls. Which event could cause He nearly fainted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Arnold saw a boy. (B) A girl came up to hug him one day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Arnold's fear of girls suggests that he may have a phobia or anxiety around them. Therefore, it is more plausible that a girl coming up to hug him would cause him to nearly faint, as it would be a direct confrontation with his fear. Seeing a boy would not necessarily trigger the same response."}}
{"Q": "Six year old Bobby wanted a cat very badly. Which event could cause Bobby was overjoyed when his mother said the cat could stay?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bobby found a cat in the garden. (B) Bobby begged his mom for a feral cat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Bobby finding a cat in the garden is a more plausible event that could cause him to be overjoyed when his mother said the cat could stay. It shows that Bobby had a connection with the cat and had already formed a bond with it, making him very happy to be able to keep it as a pet. On the other hand, begging for a feral cat may not be as likely to result in Bobby being overjoyed, as feral cats can be difficult to tame and may not make the best pets."}}
{"Q": "There was a unique pair of louboutin sandals Lucy had to have. Which event could cause Finally by chance, she stumbled across a pair?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucky looked for them in one store. (B) Lucy looked for the sandals everywhere, but could never find them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Lucy had looked for the sandals in just one store, it would not be considered \"by chance\" when she finally found them. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Lucy had been searching for the sandals everywhere, indicating that she had exhausted all possible options before stumbling across them by chance. This makes it a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My dad and I like to hunt for worms. Which event could cause My dad and I decided to sell some worms and use the rest for fishing?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We love to go fishing. (B) We found one of them in the backyard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. We love to go fishing.\nExplanation: Since the statement mentions that the speaker and their dad like to hunt for worms, it is likely that they use the worms for fishing. Therefore, it makes sense that if they have a surplus of worms, they would decide to sell some and use the rest for fishing. Choice A provides a plausible reason for why they would want to use the worms for fishing. Choice B is not related to the topic of hunting for worms or fishing, so it is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "We decided to move to a new town next year. Which event could cause It will be a fun adventure?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We grew fond of this town. (B) We got sick of this town.", "R": {"text": "Answer: We grew fond of this town.\nExplanation: If we grew fond of this town, it means we have positive memories and experiences here. Moving to a new town would then be seen as an exciting adventure to explore new places and create new memories. It is more plausible than getting sick of this town, which would imply negative experiences and a desire to leave rather than a sense of adventure."}}
{"Q": "Heather stole Ryan's phone. Which event could cause Ryan snatched his phone back and reported Heather to administration?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ryan was mad at Kim for stealing his phone. (B) Heather kept the phone away from Ryan.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Heather kept the phone away from Ryan.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ryan would snatch his phone back and report Heather to administration if she kept the phone away from him, rather than if he was mad at someone else for stealing his phone. If Heather was intentionally withholding Ryan's phone from him, it would be a clear violation of his property rights and could lead to him taking action to retrieve it and report her actions."}}
{"Q": "Tracy E Warren keeps his house cleaner than any woman. Which event could cause Finally I just asked him and he said he has a maid so now I know?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tracy spends his days scrubbing and cleaning. (B) I asked him how it is so clean.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I asked him how it is so clean. \nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly addresses the question of how Tracy keeps his house so clean. Option (A) is unlikely because it suggests that Tracy spends all his time cleaning, which is not a sustainable or practical way to maintain a clean house."}}
{"Q": "Kya was trying to be vegan. Which event could cause Before long, being vegan was effortless?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kya learned many new steak recipes. (B) At first it was hard, but she persevered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B states that Kya persevered despite the initial difficulties, which implies that she continued to make an effort to be vegan. Over time, this effort would have become a habit, making it easier for her to maintain a vegan lifestyle. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that Kya learned new recipes for steak, which is not relevant to her goal of being vegan. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Today I bought a solar panel system for my house. Which event could cause I hope the system pays for itself within ten years?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The system was very expensive to have installed. (B) This month, my electric bill was double  what is used to be.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) This month, my electric bill was double what it used to be.\nExplanation: If the electric bill has doubled, it means that the household is consuming more electricity than before. With the solar panel system, the household can generate its own electricity and reduce its reliance on the grid. This can lead to significant savings on the electric bill over time, which can help the system pay for itself within ten years. On the other hand, the cost of installation (option A) may not necessarily impact the system's ability to pay for itself, as it depends on the savings generated by the system over time."}}
{"Q": "My parents live a few blocks from me. Which event could cause Somehow there was enough room and it was a lot of fun?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We all had dinner at my big house. (B) We all had dinner at my tiny house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: We all had dinner at my big house.\nExplanation: If everyone had dinner at a big house, there would be enough room for everyone to be comfortable and have fun. If everyone had dinner at a tiny house, it would be unlikely that there would be enough room for everyone to have a good time."}}
{"Q": "Lilly sent a lovely table for her dinner party. Which event could cause She didn't tell anyone the cat had been licking it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There wasn't any food on a plate. (B) there was a piece of steak on a plate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) there was a piece of steak on a plate.\nExplanation: If there was a piece of steak on a plate, it is more likely that someone would notice the cat hair or saliva on the table, especially if they were cutting the steak and using the table as a surface. If there wasn't any food on a plate, it is less likely that anyone would have noticed the cat hair or saliva on the table."}}
{"Q": "Helen hung up the stocking on the railing. Which event could cause And someone had put presents in her stocking?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Helen went to the store. (B) Helen went to sleep.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that someone put presents in Helen's stocking while she was asleep, as it is a common tradition for Santa Claus or family members to fill stockings with gifts during the night before Christmas. It is less likely that Helen would have received presents in her stocking while she was out shopping."}}
{"Q": "Tim wanted to mail a gift to his mom in a different state. Which event could cause Tim left an apology in her voicemail and promised to call her later?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim forgot the gift in his car until after her birthday. (B) Tim realized it would barely make it in time for her birthday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Tim forgot the gift in his car until after her birthday, it would be a more plausible reason for him to apologize and promise to call her later. Forgetting the gift would be a bigger mistake than just barely making it in time, and it would be understandable for Tim to feel bad about it and want to make it up to his mom."}}
{"Q": "Greg was arrested for manslaughter. Which event could cause So Greg was convicted?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) greg had not called the police right away. (B) Greg's lawyer made a compelling defense case.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Greg had not called the police right away.\nExplanation: If Greg had not called the police right away, it could be seen as negligence on his part and could be used as evidence against him in court. This could show that he did not take immediate action to prevent the death of the victim, which could lead to a conviction for manslaughter. On the other hand, a compelling defense case by Greg's lawyer may not be enough to overturn the evidence presented against him."}}
{"Q": "Joe could not remember his address. Which event could cause After that he always remembered it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe could not have a pizza delivered. (B) He made up a a rhyme that included his phone number.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Joe could not have a pizza delivered.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is a practical and urgent situation that would require Joe to remember his address. Being unable to have a pizza delivered due to not knowing his address would likely cause Joe to feel embarrassed or frustrated, motivating him to make a conscious effort to remember his address in the future. On the other hand, making up a rhyme that includes his phone number may not necessarily help him remember his address."}}
{"Q": "Nadia needed new ballet shoes. Which event could cause After her first dance show, she paid him back?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nadia's friend gifted her the money for new shoes. (B) A friend bought Nadia a pair.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) A friend bought Nadia a pair.\nExplanation: Since Nadia needed new ballet shoes, it is more plausible that a friend bought her a pair after her first dance show. It is less likely that Nadia's friend gifted her the money for new shoes since she would have had to go out and purchase them herself. Additionally, it is common for friends to give gifts after a successful performance, so it is more likely that a friend bought Nadia a pair of ballet shoes as a gift."}}
{"Q": "Michael loved to play basketball, but wasn't very good. Which event could cause He made the team and went on to be a star?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Matthew read the basketball rules and practiced the game. (B) He practiced and tried out for a role.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He practiced and tried out for a role.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Michael's hard work and dedication to practicing basketball paid off when he tried out for the team and was able to improve his skills enough to become a star player. Reading the rules and practicing alone may have helped him improve, but it is unlikely that it would have been enough to make him a star player without the opportunity to play on a team and compete against others."}}
{"Q": "Mike was an incredible Chess player. Which event could cause Joseph won the chess game and Mike was humbled?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike entered a contest partnering with Joseph. (B) Joseph could tell Mike was playing too over-confidently.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joseph won the chess game and humbled Mike because he could tell that Mike was playing too over-confidently. This suggests that Mike may have underestimated Joseph's skills or become too complacent in his own abilities, leading to his defeat. On the other hand, it is less likely that Mike would lose a game while partnering with Joseph, as they would be working together and could potentially cover each other's weaknesses."}}
{"Q": "Lisa was going home. Which event could cause The next day Lucy missed Lisa when she saw their drawings?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) All flights were grounded to Lisa couldn't leave for a couple of days. (B) Lucy shared supplies in art class with Lisa, they bonded.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) All flights were grounded to Lisa couldn't leave for a couple of days.\nExplanation: If all flights were grounded, Lisa would not be able to leave and would have to stay for a couple of days longer than planned. This would cause Lucy to miss Lisa the next day when she saw their drawings because she was expecting Lisa to be there. On the other hand, option (B) is not a plausible answer as bonding over shared supplies in art class would not necessarily cause Lucy to miss Lisa the next day when she saw their drawings."}}
{"Q": "Martha was a terrible cook and her boyfriend knew it. Which event could cause After a while, everything Martha cooked was delicious?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Martha's boyfriend enrolled himself in cooking classes. (B) Martha worked hard to learn some recipies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Martha worked hard to learn some recipes.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Martha herself worked hard to improve her cooking skills rather than her boyfriend enrolling in cooking classes. Martha may have taken cooking classes, watched cooking shows, or practiced cooking more frequently to improve her skills. It is also possible that she received advice or tips from friends or family members who were good cooks. Therefore, option (B) is a more likely event that could have caused Martha's cooking to improve."}}
{"Q": "Lucy was at home waiting for her husband. Which event could cause Lucy's husband was excited and thrill?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her husband did not expect Lucy to be home yet. (B) she couldn't wait to tell him she wanted a divorce.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Lucy's husband did not expect her to be home yet, it could mean that he has a surprise or something exciting planned for her. This could cause him to be excited and thrilled, as he may have been looking forward to this moment. On the other hand, if Lucy wanted a divorce, it is unlikely that her husband would be excited or thrilled about it. It would be a more negative and emotional event for him. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kelsi was new at school and wanted to make new friends. Which event could cause Lucy was happy she was able to have a best friend finally?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelsi and Thomas met at school. (B) Kelsi saw Lucy was reading the same book she was.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Kelsi saw Lucy was reading the same book she was.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Kelsi and Lucy bonded over a shared interest in a book, as this is a common way for people to connect and start a conversation. Meeting someone new at school (choice A) may not necessarily lead to an immediate close friendship."}}
{"Q": "I saved up money for a long time. Which event could cause I took the boat out on the lake and felt happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) i had enough money to spend on food and extra stuff. (B) I bought my dream cat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Having enough money to spend on food and extra stuff may have given the person a sense of financial security and freedom, which could have led to them feeling happy and able to enjoy their time on the boat without worrying about their finances. Buying a dream cat, while exciting, is not directly related to the experience of being on a boat and feeling happy."}}
{"Q": "Jake had a new toy Spiderman silly string web slinger. Which event could cause Dan's mother posted photo's on Facebook of Dan covered in silly strin?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jake immediately threw his new toy in the trash. (B) Jake decided Dan was the Green Goblin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Jake immediately threw his new toy in the trash.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jake, feeling guilty or ashamed for covering Dan in silly string, would throw away the toy that caused the mess. It is unlikely that he would suddenly decide that Dan was a villain from the Spiderman comics and act on that belief."}}
{"Q": "Margo was going to the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Which event could cause Eventually, the show was over?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Margo sat down to watch. (B) Margo left the show.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Margo left the show.\nExplanation: If Margo left the show, it would be a plausible reason for the show eventually being over for her. If she sat down to watch, it doesn't necessarily mean the show would end anytime soon."}}
{"Q": "Barry loves playing baseball. Which event could cause Barry also bought a hot dog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Barry's team won the game today. (B) Barry went to the bar for a game.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Barry's team won the game today.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Barry would buy a hot dog to celebrate his team's victory after playing baseball rather than going to a bar for a game. Buying a hot dog is a common way to celebrate a win at a baseball game."}}
{"Q": "Erina's first day at her new job was today. Which event could cause Her new boss complimented her on her performance?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Erina gave it her all and did well. (B) Erina took too many breaks the first day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that Erina's boss would compliment her if she did well and gave it her all on her first day, rather than taking too many breaks. Taking too many breaks would not be seen as a positive performance."}}
{"Q": "Penny was five Year's old and loved to play video games. Which event could cause The screen cracked and she was unable to play for a month?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Penny dropped her game on accident. (B) She accidentally sold her game console.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Penny accidentally dropped her game console, causing the screen to crack and making it unusable for a month. Accidentally selling the game console seems less likely as it would require Penny to actively participate in the sale and not realize what she was doing."}}
{"Q": "Amy went to get frozen yogurt on her break. Which event could cause Amy ended up throwing most of the yogurt in the trash?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy robbed the frozen yogurt store and ate all of the yogurt. (B) Amy was called back to work and her frozen yogurt melted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Amy's frozen yogurt melted due to being called back to work, rather than her robbing the store and eating all of the yogurt. It is also more likely that she would throw away melted yogurt rather than robbed yogurt."}}
{"Q": "Ellen wanted to know if she could wear leggings while tap dancing. Which event could cause Ellen decided to wear whatever she wanted in the future?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ellen realized that she could. (B) Ellen was told there was a dress code.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Ellen realized that she could wear leggings while tap dancing, she would feel more confident in her decision to wear them in the future. On the other hand, if she was told there was a dress code, she may feel restricted and less likely to wear leggings. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lily wanted a new Halloween costume. Which event could cause She ended up making a rabbit costume?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lily decided to make her costume a bear costume. (B) All the costumes were gone though.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) All the costumes were gone though.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because if all the costumes were gone, Lily would have had to come up with a new idea for her costume. Making a rabbit costume could have been a creative solution to the problem of not being able to find a pre-made costume. Choosing to make a bear costume instead (option A) would not explain why Lily ended up with a rabbit costume."}}
{"Q": "Once there was a girl named Mia who could spell well. Which event could cause Mia won the spelling bee and felt more sure of herself afterwards?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She studied hard because she wanted to spell. (B) Mia entered the spelling bee but didn't practice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) She studied hard because she wanted to spell.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Mia's hard work and dedication to studying for the spelling bee would lead to her winning and feeling more confident in her abilities. If she didn't practice and just entered the spelling bee, it would be unlikely for her to win and feel more sure of herself afterwards."}}
{"Q": "Everyone at my bus stop were waiting for the bus. Which event could cause My teacher told me to stand outside since I came too late?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The bus was late and so was I to school. (B) bus showed up early and I was late for class.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The bus was late and so was I to school.\nExplanation: If everyone at the bus stop was waiting for the bus, it is more likely that the bus was late rather than showing up early. If the bus was late, it would have caused the student to arrive late to school, which could have resulted in the teacher telling them to stand outside."}}
{"Q": "Jean wanted to travel to Africa. Which event could cause Jean's trip to Africa was better than she had hoped?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jean booked her trip and went. (B) Jean ended up having a bad time in Africa.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Jean booked her trip and went, it means that she was able to successfully plan and execute her trip to Africa. If she had a good time during her trip, it would exceed her expectations and make it better than she had hoped. On the other hand, if she had a bad time in Africa, it would not meet her expectations and would not be better than she had hoped. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mary had never made rice before. Which event could cause She resolved to read directions next time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary ended up overcooking the pasta. (B) The rice Mary put on the stove out over and burned on the stove.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Mary had never made rice before, it is more plausible that she would burn the rice on the stove and realize that she needs to read the directions next time. Overcooking pasta may not necessarily lead to the realization that she needs to read directions for rice."}}
{"Q": "Brad woke up late this morning. Which event could cause He had worn 2 different pairs of shoes to work this morning?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Brad rushed to work. (B) He was in such a slow mood, he didn't dress correctly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Brad rushed to work.\nExplanation: If Brad woke up late, he may have been in a hurry to get ready and may not have paid close attention to what he was putting on his feet. Rushing can lead to mistakes like wearing mismatched shoes. Option B suggests that Brad was intentionally not dressing correctly, which is less likely than simply making a mistake while rushing."}}
{"Q": "I was getting ready to leave my hotel room for the day. Which event could cause I was relieved that it was only a drill?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I left all my stuff out on the bed. (B) I heard loud fire alarm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the person heard a loud fire alarm, it would be a plausible reason for them to be relieved that it was only a drill. Leaving their stuff out on the bed would not necessarily be affected by a drill or a real emergency."}}
{"Q": "For a lark I started dragging my foot behind me at work. Which event could cause He told me to knock it off?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My shoes made a really loud sound in front of my boss. (B) I fell and broke my leg.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Dragging your foot behind you at work could be seen as unprofessional or distracting, but it is unlikely to cause serious harm or injury. However, if your shoes made a loud sound in front of your boss, it could draw unwanted attention and potentially disrupt the workplace. Therefore, it is more plausible that your boss would tell you to knock it off in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Tony liked art. Which event could cause Tony then went back to school and found a different major?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) However, he was not very talented, and his hair did not sell very well. (B) Tony applies for a lot of art gallery jobs and got rejected.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tony applied for a lot of art gallery jobs and got rejected, it could have caused him to reconsider his career path and possibly switch to a different major. This is a more plausible answer than option A, which suggests that Tony's lack of talent and unsuccessful hair sales would lead him to change his major, which may not necessarily be related to his interest in art."}}
{"Q": "I found a $600 dollar envelope in the mail today. Which event could cause I am honest?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I turned the $600 dollars to the authorities. (B) I returned the empty envelope to the person it was addressed to.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I returned the empty envelope to the person it was addressed to.\nExplanation: Returning the empty envelope to the person it was addressed to shows honesty because it demonstrates that the person did not keep the money for themselves and made an effort to return the item to its rightful owner. Turning the money over to authorities could also be seen as honest, but it is less likely as the person could have kept the money for themselves before turning it in."}}
{"Q": "Becky has a nephew named Dominick. Which event could cause Becky and Dominick can now play Uno together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dominick moved his house away from Becky's house. (B) Dominick shifted their house near the Becky house so.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Dominick shifted their house near the Becky house so.\nExplanation: If Dominick's house is near Becky's house, it would be easier for them to meet and play Uno together. If Dominick moved his house away from Becky's house, it would be more difficult for them to meet and play together."}}
{"Q": "Tom was accidentally shot by his teammate in the army. Which event could cause He ends up being homeless?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom developed emotional problems affecting his division. (B) Tom was unable to find work being in a wheelchair.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Tom developed emotional problems after being accidentally shot by his teammate, it could affect his ability to perform his duties in the army and lead to his discharge. This could result in him being unable to find work and eventually becoming homeless. On the other hand, being in a wheelchair may limit his job opportunities, but there are still many jobs that he could do from a wheelchair, so it is less likely to be the sole cause of him becoming homeless."}}
{"Q": "Tommy was having a bad day. Which event could cause Tommy had good friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tommy's friends cheered him up. (B) Tommy's friends didn't pay attention to him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tommy's friends cheered him up.\nExplanation: If Tommy's friends cheered him up, it shows that they care about him and want to make him feel better. This indicates that they are good friends who are there for him during tough times. On the other hand, if Tommy's friends didn't pay attention to him, it suggests that they are not very supportive or caring, which would not make them good friends. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jay wanted to vote. Which event could cause That is, until he got older and did it again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jay wasn't sure how to vote. (B) Jay swore he'd never vote again.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Jay wasn't sure how to vote.\nExplanation: It is common for young adults to be unsure about the voting process and how to participate in elections. As Jay got older, he may have become more informed and confident in his ability to vote, leading him to try again. On the other hand, there is no context or reason given for Jay to swear off voting altogether, making option (B) less plausible."}}
{"Q": "I was really nervous before my first middle school dance. Which event could cause Now, she won't even talk to me?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My date threw up on me. (B) I threw up on my date.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My date threw up on me.\nExplanation: While both options are embarrassing and could potentially ruin the night, it is more plausible that the other person throwing up on you would cause them to avoid talking to you afterwards. It would be understandable for them to feel embarrassed and want to distance themselves from the situation."}}
{"Q": "My four-year-old nephew loves to wake us up. Which event could cause As I screamed, he yelled cold hands?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Today I was ready for him. When he came into our room a jumped out and tickled him. (B) He would jump on our ear to get our attention.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He would jump on our ear to get our attention.\nExplanation: If the nephew is jumping on the person's ear to wake them up, it is likely that the person would scream in surprise or pain. The nephew yelling \"cold hands\" could be a result of him touching the person's ear with his cold hands while jumping on them. Option (A) does not seem to fit the scenario as tickling the nephew would not necessarily cause the person to scream and yell."}}
{"Q": "I loved to make my wife laugh. Which event could cause I started making her laugh again and she became happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The my wife became sad. (B) My husband was sad so I thought I would cheer her up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the wife became sad, it is more likely that the husband would try to make her laugh and cheer her up. It is a natural response to try to lift the spirits of someone who is feeling down. On the other hand, if the husband was sad, it may not necessarily lead to him trying to make his wife laugh. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Rachel was cooking dinner. Which event could cause Then she pulled herself together and took care of the cut?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rachel burned her hand. (B) She cut her finger when chopping vegetables.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She cut her finger when chopping vegetables.\nExplanation: Cutting a finger while chopping vegetables is a common kitchen accident that can happen to anyone. It is a plausible event that could cause Rachel to pull herself together and take care of the cut. Burning her hand could also be a possible event, but it may not necessarily require her to pull herself together and take care of the burn immediately."}}
{"Q": "Sam loved striped clothes. Which event could cause She began to wear stripes every day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam got lots of complaints about her clothing. (B) She decided to go out and buy and entire outfit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She decided to go out and buy an entire outfit.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sam's love for stripes would lead her to buy an entire outfit rather than getting complaints about her clothing. If she received complaints, it is unlikely that she would continue to wear stripes every day. However, if she decided to buy an entire outfit, it shows a deliberate choice and commitment to her love for stripes."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy's phone ringed in class. Which event could cause As a result, she called the security guard to take him away?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He ended up getting in trouble. (B) Jimmy talked on the phone and wouldn't stop, delighting the professor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He ended up getting in trouble.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jimmy's phone ringing in class would be seen as a disruption and a violation of classroom rules, leading to him getting in trouble. The fact that the teacher called the security guard to take him away suggests that his behavior was not acceptable and required intervention. Option B, where Jimmy talks on the phone and delights the professor, seems unlikely as it goes against typical classroom norms and expectations."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was cooking dinner for her parents for the first time. Which event could cause Everyone laughed and they joked about it for years?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She severely undercooked the chicken and badly burned the potatoes. (B) Kelly's dinner was tasty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Severely undercooking the chicken and badly burning the potatoes is a common mistake for inexperienced cooks and can lead to a humorous and memorable dinner experience. It is also a mistake that can be easily fixed by ordering takeout or going out to eat, making it a funny story to tell in the future. On the other hand, if Kelly's dinner was tasty, it may have been a pleasant surprise but not necessarily a memorable event that would be joked about for years."}}
{"Q": "Amber was scared about her future. Which event could cause She was no longer worried about her future?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amber talked to her academic advisor. (B) Amber talked to her psychic advisor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Amber talked to her academic advisor.\nExplanation: Talking to an academic advisor is a more plausible answer as they can provide practical advice and guidance on career paths, job opportunities, and educational options. On the other hand, talking to a psychic advisor may not provide concrete solutions to Amber's concerns and may not be a reliable source of information."}}
{"Q": "The day of the big game had arrived. Which event could cause Terry scored 2 goals that day and got his team the victory?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terry practiced for a long time. (B) terry was so big.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Terry practiced for a long time.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Terry's hard work and dedication in practicing led to his success in scoring 2 goals and helping his team win the game. Being big alone does not necessarily guarantee success in sports."}}
{"Q": "Sara wanted a new puppy really badly. Which event could cause A raccoon sprang out and Sara never wanted an animal again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sara was outside looking at the neighbor's dog. (B) Sara was outside looking at the neighbor's underwear.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it involves Sara being outside and potentially encountering a raccoon, which could scare her and make her not want an animal again. Option B, on the other hand, is unlikely and irrelevant to the situation."}}
{"Q": "Monica was at the library with her boyfriend. Which event could cause She kicked them out because they were loitering?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Children brought food and left their trash laying on the reading table. (B) The librarian noticed Monica and her boyfriend were just hanging out reading.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The event that could cause Monica and her boyfriend to be kicked out of the library is that children brought food and left their trash laying on the reading table. This is a plausible reason for being kicked out of the library as it goes against the library's rules and can be disruptive to other patrons. Loitering alone is not a valid reason for being kicked out of the library."}}
{"Q": "When Jen is 10 years old she wants to wear makeup. Which event could cause Jen learns her lesson?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jen applied her mother's makeup and looked like a clown. (B) Jen's mother let her put on her own makeup but Jen's friends complimented her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Jen applies her mother's makeup and looks like a clown, she will likely learn that makeup application requires skill and practice. This experience may make her realize that she needs to learn more about makeup before she can wear it confidently. On the other hand, if Jen's mother lets her put on her own makeup and her friends compliment her, she may feel encouraged to continue wearing makeup without learning the necessary skills and techniques. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Every night the alarm would go off at Ted's house. Which event could cause It turns out a stray cat set off the alarm?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He would run outside but nobody would be there. (B) Ted got sick of being woken up, so he stayed up all night to moved out of his house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the alarm was set off by a stray cat than Ted moving out of his house because of being woken up. Running outside and finding nobody there suggests that it was a false alarm, which could easily be caused by a curious cat triggering the motion sensor. Ted moving out of his house seems like an extreme and unlikely response to a nightly alarm."}}
{"Q": "Neil had tried to see the Loch Ness Monster on his trip to Scotland. Which event could cause They said they did not believe in the monster at all?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They saw the monster themselves. (B) Neil asked the locals where to find it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If someone saw the monster themselves, it would be difficult for them to deny its existence. Therefore, it is more plausible that if someone said they did not believe in the monster at all, it is because they did not see it themselves. Option B, Neil asking the locals where to find it, does not necessarily indicate whether or not the person believes in the monster."}}
{"Q": "I woke up one morning and went outside to grab the newspaper. Which event could cause I went outside and quickly grabbed my newspaper?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was a tornado outside. (B) It was raining and I did not want to get wet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It was raining and I did not want to get wet.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is a common occurrence for people to quickly grab their newspaper when it is raining outside to avoid getting wet. Tornadoes are rare and dangerous weather events that would likely cause someone to seek shelter instead of going outside to grab a newspaper."}}
{"Q": "Jim was incredibly tired one morning. Which event could cause After he woke up, he saw a steaming, boiling pot on the stove?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim's wife knew he was tired and made coffee. (B) jim made breakfast.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jim's wife knew he was tired and made coffee for him, rather than Jim making breakfast and forgetting about the pot on the stove. Additionally, the fact that the pot was steaming and boiling suggests that it was recently heated, which further supports the idea that someone else had prepared it for Jim."}}
{"Q": "The family prepared the food and packed it away. Which event could cause The family had a horrible day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) After the picnic, it started raining. (B) Popped a tire and spent their picnic time waiting for a tow-truck.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Popped a tire and spent their picnic time waiting for a tow-truck.\nExplanation: This event could cause the family to have a horrible day because they were not able to enjoy their picnic as planned and had to spend their time waiting for a tow-truck. It could have been frustrating and disappointing for them, especially after they had already prepared the food and packed it away. On the other hand, while rain could have also ruined their picnic, it is not necessarily a more plausible answer as it is a common occurrence and the family could have prepared for it by bringing umbrellas or finding shelter."}}
{"Q": "Tim never locked his bathroom window. Which event could cause Tim was glad he kept the window unlocked?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim was able to break through the window. (B) Tim lost his keys to the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tim lost his keys to the house, he would be locked out and the unlocked bathroom window would provide a way for him to enter his house. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Tim would need to break through his own bathroom window, making option A less plausible."}}
{"Q": "A friend of the family has an old farm. Which event could cause No sane dog chases a pack of wild coyotes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The people that live on the old farm has a dog that fears nothing. (B) There is an old dog on the farm who has lost its mind and barks all day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The people that live on the old farm has a dog that fears nothing.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the dog on the farm is well-trained and knows not to chase after wild coyotes, rather than an old dog losing its mind and barking all day. Additionally, it is common for dogs to be trained not to chase after wild animals for their own safety."}}
{"Q": "Oren needs to earn extra money for school. Which event could cause Oren feels great that he will be earning extra money?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Oren got a part time job delivering pizza. (B) he went inside and got a part time job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Oren got a part time job delivering pizza.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it specifically mentions that Oren will be earning extra money, which is his goal. Additionally, delivering pizza is a common part-time job for students and can provide flexible hours that work around his school schedule. Going inside and getting a part-time job could mean anything and may not necessarily guarantee extra money."}}
{"Q": "Beth was a model in a fashion show at her school. Which event could cause Beth missed the show, and was unable to tell anyone she wasn't coming?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Beth passed out from overeating. (B) Beth went out and broke her phone with no ride home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Beth went out and broke her phone with no ride home.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because if Beth passed out from overeating, someone would have noticed and been able to inform the organizers of the fashion show. However, if Beth broke her phone and had no way to contact anyone, she would have no way of letting them know she couldn't make it. This is a more realistic scenario that could happen in real life."}}
{"Q": "Overnight there was a huge lightning storm that knocked out the power. Which event could cause Everyone was late and had to hurry?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Everyone realized that the power was out for a long time. (B) When I awoke, I rolled over and saw the alarm clock flashing 6 o'clock and I knew I'd missed my interview.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the power was out for a long time, it would be unlikely that everyone would be late and have to hurry. However, if someone missed their alarm clock due to the power outage, they would likely be late and have to hurry to make up for lost time."}}
{"Q": "Amelia wanted to be friends with Kiku. Which event could cause They had both wanted to be friends with each other?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were both very shy, but were attracted to eachother without even knowing!. (B) She went under to say hello.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible as it suggests that both Amelia and Kiku were attracted to each other without even knowing, which could have led to them both wanting to be friends with each other. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide enough context or explanation to suggest why they both wanted to be friends with each other."}}
{"Q": "A man was thrown out of every residence he could find. Which event could cause Now he is homeless, and society at large is poorer for it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) the man failed to get a job, until recently. (B) The man eventually gave up on looking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the man eventually gave up on looking for a residence, it is likely that he faced multiple rejections and difficulties in finding a place to live. This could be due to various reasons such as a bad credit score, criminal record, or lack of references. As a result, he became homeless, which not only affects his own well-being but also has a negative impact on society as a whole. Homelessness can lead to increased crime rates, health issues, and strain on public resources. Therefore, society is poorer for it when individuals are unable to find stable housing."}}
{"Q": "Chad was recently visiting his sister for Christmas. Which event could cause Chad decided he would not be eating the piece of cake?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chad ate so much at dinner that he was getting heartburn, then his sister brought out a cake. (B) Chad didn't eat cause he had the flu.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Chad would not eat the cake because he was already feeling full and experiencing heartburn from eating too much at dinner. It is less likely that he would not eat the cake because he had the flu, as this would likely affect his appetite for all foods, not just cake."}}
{"Q": "Amber loves to read. Which event could cause She went to the library instead?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ambers friends wanted to see her at the library one night. (B) Amber liked having a book in her hand.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Amber liked having a book in her hand.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Amber's love for reading. It is common for avid readers to prefer physical books over digital copies, and Amber's desire to have a book in her hand could be a strong enough reason for her to go to the library instead of doing something else. On the other hand, there is no indication that Amber's friends regularly meet at the library, making option (A) less likely."}}
{"Q": "Dave decided he would wash his dad's car that weekend. Which event could cause His dad wasn't mad but told Dave to be careful next time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dave accidentally scratched his dad's car, but told him. (B) dave almost damaged the car while washing it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Dave accidentally scratched his dad's car but was honest and told him, his dad may not be happy about the scratch but would appreciate Dave's honesty and caution in the future. On the other hand, if Dave almost damaged the car while washing it, his dad may be more upset and caution him to be more careful next time. However, the fact that his dad wasn't mad suggests that Dave was honest about any mistakes he made, making option A the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Chloe loved the book she was reading. Which event could cause She went three pages without remembering what she read?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One night, Chloe had the tv on while she was reading her book. (B) The book couldn't get her attention.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Chloe had the TV on while reading, it could have distracted her and caused her to lose focus on the book, leading to her going three pages without remembering what she read. On the other hand, if the book couldn't get her attention, it is less likely that she would have enjoyed it enough to forget what she read. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mike was running out of closet space. Which event could cause Mike realized that he didn't have enough coat hangers?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mike kept getting more clothes. (B) Mike discovered excess coat hangers took up most of the closet space.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Mike kept getting more clothes.\nExplanation: If Mike kept getting more clothes, it would make sense that he would eventually run out of closet space and realize he didn't have enough coat hangers. On the other hand, if Mike discovered excess coat hangers taking up most of the closet space, he would have already known he had enough hangers and the problem would be with the excess hangers taking up space."}}
{"Q": "I took a shovel to the woods and buried my brother's birthday present. Which event could cause He had so much fun, that now it's an annual tradition?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I made a big game hunt for him to hunt in. (B) My brother was surprised on the birthday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the surprise of finding a buried birthday present in the woods would lead to a fun and memorable experience for the brother, which could then become an annual tradition. A big game hunt may also be fun, but it is less likely to become an annual tradition as it requires more planning and resources."}}
{"Q": "Mimi was an old lady when I met her. Which event could cause That's a little hard to believe since she is less than 5 feet tall?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mimi told me that she used to play pool. (B) Mimi told me she used to be a star basketball player.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mimi used to play pool, as height is not a significant factor in playing pool. On the other hand, being a star basketball player would require a certain level of height and physical ability, which may be unlikely for someone who is less than 5 feet tall."}}
{"Q": "A man was looking to adopt a new cat. Which event could cause He immediately adopted this cat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He went to a store for pets and saw a cute cat. (B) The man saw a pretty cat that really liked him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man would adopt a cat if he went to a store specifically for pets and saw a cute cat, rather than just stumbling upon a pretty cat that liked him. Going to a pet store shows that the man was actively seeking to adopt a cat, and the sight of a cute cat would likely seal the deal."}}
{"Q": "Rona was doing research into natural language processing. Which event could cause Rona found it delicious, with a dash of pepper and a pinch of salt?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She went into the research to document her findings. (B) Rona took a break from her research and made some Kraft macaroni and cheese.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rona took a break from her research and made some Kraft macaroni and cheese, which she found delicious with a dash of pepper and a pinch of salt. This event is unrelated to her research into natural language processing and is a more likely cause of her enjoyment of the food."}}
{"Q": "Arnold was scared of rabbits. Which event could cause Arnold nearly fainted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A deer approached him. (B) Arnold's mother made rabbit soup for dinner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Arnold's mother made rabbit soup for dinner.\nExplanation: Since Arnold is scared of rabbits, the thought of eating them in soup form could be enough to cause him to nearly faint. A deer approaching him may startle him, but it is not directly related to his fear of rabbits."}}
{"Q": "Billy wanted to become a doctor. Which event could cause He was so depressed, he became an alcoholic?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Instead, he spent his life chasing women and doing drugs. (B) Billy dropped out of school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Billy dropped out of school.\nExplanation: Dropping out of school could have caused Billy to feel like he had failed in achieving his dream of becoming a doctor, leading to depression and turning to alcohol as a coping mechanism. This scenario is more plausible than the alternative of Billy completely abandoning his aspirations and engaging in reckless behavior."}}
{"Q": "My sister was in an open relationship. Which event could cause My sister dumped him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My sister cheated on her boyfriend anyways. (B) My sister dumped the person she was in an open relationship with.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) My sister dumped the person she was in an open relationship with.\nExplanation: While cheating is a possibility, it is not necessarily the only reason for ending an open relationship. It is possible that my sister simply decided that the open relationship was not working for her and that she wanted to end things with her partner. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a lack of emotional connection or a desire for a more traditional monogamous relationship. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My mom promised me that we would go to a restaurant on Friday. Which event could cause She apologized for being dishonest to me in the past?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She said the same thing last week so I didn't believe her. (B) My mom and me had a long talk there about the present.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the mom had promised the same thing last week and didn't follow through, it would make sense for her to apologize for being dishonest in the past. This suggests that the mom has a history of not keeping her promises, which would make the child skeptical of her current promise to go to the restaurant."}}
{"Q": "Rick was an older man with a large family. Which event could cause He passed away while he was sleeping and had a smile on his face?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rick had lived a sad, boring life. (B) Rick's family visited him while he was ill.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Rick's family visited him while he was ill.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rick passed away peacefully with a smile on his face after spending time with his loved ones. This suggests that he was surrounded by family members who brought him joy and comfort during his final moments. It is less likely that he would have had a smile on his face if he had lived a sad and boring life."}}
{"Q": "Simon noticed a moving truck in front of the house next door. Which event could cause He hung out with her all day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Simon's friend Ann was moving away. (B) Simon's friend Ann was moving in with him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Simon's friend Ann was moving away, it would make sense for him to spend the day with her before she left. If she was moving in with him, it would be unlikely that he would spend the whole day with her since they would be living together."}}
{"Q": "The entire group of teens clambered into the raft. Which event could cause They had such an amazing time on the river that day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They were looking foward to going around the rapids. (B) they all spent rafting all day long and went home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) They were looking forward to going around the rapids.\nExplanation: The fact that the entire group of teens clambered into the raft suggests that they were excited and eager to go on this adventure. The mention of rapids also implies that they were seeking a thrilling experience. Therefore, it is more plausible that they had an amazing time because they were able to fulfill their expectations of going around the rapids. Option (B) is less likely because spending the entire day rafting without any specific excitement or adventure mentioned would not necessarily guarantee an amazing time."}}
{"Q": "Sara worked very hard as a restaurant manager. Which event could cause She was able to quit her management job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she went to school at night and got a degree in computer programming. (B) Sara won nothing in the lottery.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Sara went to school at night and got a degree in computer programming, she may have found a new job in that field that she was more interested in pursuing. This would be a plausible reason for her to quit her management job. On the other hand, winning nothing in the lottery would not be a significant enough event to cause her to quit her job."}}
{"Q": "Ada was emptying the trash one night. Which event could cause Ada had to pick up all the trash from the floor?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) the bag broke as Ada was walking out the door. (B) The trash bag ripped open from a hole in the top.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The trash bag ripped open from a hole in the top.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because if the bag had simply broken as Ada was walking out the door, it would have been easier for her to gather the trash back into the bag. However, if the bag ripped open from a hole in the top, the trash would have spilled out onto the floor and Ada would have had to pick it all up. This scenario is more likely to result in Ada having to pick up all the trash from the floor."}}
{"Q": "Steve was concerned because his bills were piling up. Which event could cause Before long Steve was paying all his bills on time and was debt free?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Steve was paying too much money on late fees. (B) Steve decided to get a job paying minimum wage.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Steve was paying too much money on late fees, it would make sense that he would eventually realize he needed to change his habits and start paying his bills on time to avoid these fees. By doing so, he would be able to save money and eventually become debt free. On the other hand, getting a job paying minimum wage may not necessarily solve Steve's problem of bills piling up, as he may not be earning enough to cover all of his expenses."}}
{"Q": "Bruce was scared of the dark. Which event could cause Bruce was so grateful he kissed Jim full on the lips?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bruce asked Jim to turn on the lights. (B) Jim found lighter and lit a few candles for him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jim found lighter and lit a few candles for him.\nExplanation: If Bruce was scared of the dark, it is more plausible that he would be extremely grateful if Jim found a lighter and lit a few candles for him, providing some light and comfort in the darkness. Asking Jim to turn on the lights may not have been enough to alleviate Bruce's fear of the dark, whereas the act of lighting candles could have been a significant gesture of kindness and support."}}
{"Q": "We were all getting tired after a long day at Magic Kingdom. Which event could cause We figured we would be able to come back another day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We decided to leave. (B) We stayed an extra 3 hours for fun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. We decided to leave.\nExplanation: If everyone was getting tired after a long day, it is more plausible that they would decide to leave and come back another day when they are more rested and can enjoy the park fully. Staying an extra 3 hours for fun would only make them more tired and potentially ruin their experience for the next day."}}
{"Q": "The family prepared the food and packed it away. Which event could cause The family had a good day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The family saved it for the party the next day. (B) They then left for their picnic but left the food at home on accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The family saved it for the party the next day.\nExplanation: If the family saved the food for a party the next day, it suggests that they had a plan and were looking forward to spending time with loved ones. This could contribute to a good day for the family. On the other hand, accidentally leaving the food at home would likely cause frustration and disappointment, making it less likely to result in a good day."}}
{"Q": "Sally and Susan were looking forward to a night out. Which event could cause They went back to their apartment and watched movies instead?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) after two hours the club was empty almost with no people. (B) Sally had no money to go.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sally had no money to go.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because if Sally didn't have any money to go out, then they wouldn't have been able to go to the club or do any other expensive activity. It makes sense that they would have gone back to their apartment and watched movies instead as a cheaper alternative. Option (A) is less likely because if the club was empty after two hours, they could have still stayed and enjoyed themselves or found another place to go."}}
{"Q": "My teacher gave us instructions for the co-op assignment. Which event could cause However, my teacher gave me full credit while she received an F?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My partner did no work. (B) My friend and I didn't do the project together.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the teacher gave full credit to the student despite the partner doing no work, it is likely that the student completed the project on their own and did a good job. On the other hand, if the student and their friend didn't do the project together, it would be unlikely for the teacher to give full credit to the student and an F to the friend."}}
{"Q": "A couple was having a baby in two months. Which event could cause The father agreed that it was a great name?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mother suggested naming the baby after a poorly named close friend. (B) The mother suggested naming the baby Aaron.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The mother suggested naming the baby Aaron.\nExplanation: This event could cause the father to agree that it was a great name because the name Aaron is a common and well-liked name, and it is unlikely to have any negative associations or connotations. Naming the baby after a poorly named close friend would not be a desirable option, and the father may not agree that it is a great name."}}
{"Q": "Tom hiked a mountain. Which event could cause Tom upset his wife?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He stayed on a hiking trip longer than he planned. (B) He got impatient with his dog during the hike.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He stayed on a hiking trip longer than he planned.\nExplanation: If Tom stayed on the hiking trip longer than he planned, he may have missed important commitments or plans with his wife, causing her to be upset with him. On the other hand, getting impatient with his dog during the hike may not necessarily upset his wife as much as staying longer than planned."}}
{"Q": "Six year old Bobby wanted a cat very badly. Which event could cause Bobby stopped liking cats after that day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) An alley cat scratched Bobby on the hand. (B) Bobby's friend scratched him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bobby would stop liking cats if he was scratched by an alley cat, as this would be a negative experience with a real cat. Bobby's friend scratching him may not necessarily be related to cats and may not affect his overall opinion of them."}}
{"Q": "Harold was making some coffee before work. Which event could cause He discovered the milk had gone so bad that it was pouring out chunks?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He loved cream and sugar in his coffee. (B) Harold grabbed orange juice from the fridge.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Harold grabbed orange juice from the fridge.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because if Harold had grabbed orange juice from the fridge, he may not have noticed the bad milk until he poured it into his coffee. On the other hand, choice (A) is not a plausible answer because Harold's preference for cream and sugar in his coffee has no relation to the milk being bad."}}
{"Q": "Amy decided to try eyebrow waxing. Which event could cause Amy was happy she tried it since it was quicker than plucking?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy did the waxing quickly. (B) Amy found that it didn't work for her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Amy did the waxing quickly and found that it was quicker than plucking, she would be happy she tried it. On the other hand, if she found that it didn't work for her, she would not be happy with the results and would not be likely to try it again. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lily lived in a disheveled, old apartment. Which event could cause Lily finally said goodbye to the apartment on moving day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lily decided to move to an old apartment. (B) Lily found a new apartment and decided to move out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Lily found a new apartment and decided to move out.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lily would say goodbye to her old apartment on moving day because she found a new apartment and decided to move out. If Lily had decided to move to an old apartment, it wouldn't necessarily mean she would leave her current apartment. However, finding a new and better apartment would give her a reason to say goodbye to her old and disheveled one."}}
{"Q": "Neil had been journeying through Asia. Which event could cause He had always wanted to go surfing under the California sun?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Neil thought about traveling some more. (B) Neil decided he loved Asia so much that he stayed there.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Neil thought about traveling some more.\nExplanation: Since Neil had been journeying through Asia, it is more plausible that he would want to continue traveling and exploring new places rather than suddenly deciding to stay in Asia permanently. Therefore, it is likely that Neil's travels in Asia may have sparked an interest in surfing and led him to want to experience it under the California sun."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was happy to have her new phone. Which event could cause The store gave her a fair price to fix it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly cracked the phone on the screen. (B) Kelly cracked the screen on the phone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Kelly had cracked the screen on her phone, it would make sense for the store to give her a fair price to fix it. However, if she had cracked the phone itself, it may not be as easy or cost-effective to fix, so it is less likely that the store would give her a fair price."}}
{"Q": "Beth's brother Jake came to her house to check on a noise. Which event could cause Jake slept on the couch to keep her safe?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jake couldn't find the source of the noise so Beth remained afraid. (B) Jake was scared to go to sleep alone in the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jake was scared to go to sleep alone in the house, it would make sense for him to sleep on the couch to keep Beth company and make her feel safer. Option A doesn't provide a clear reason for why Jake would sleep on the couch."}}
{"Q": "Sam was in her 9th period class. Which event could cause She ended up doodling until it was time to go?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam got very bored. (B) Sam was very excited.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Sam got very bored during her 9th period class, it is more likely that she would end up doodling until it was time to go. On the other hand, if Sam was very excited, she would probably be more engaged in the class and less likely to doodle. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Morgan wanted to hold a tea party. Which event could cause Morgan is already planning her next great tea party?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Morgan's first political party was memorable!. (B) Morgan's first tea party was memorable!.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Morgan wanted to hold a tea party, it is more plausible that her first tea party was memorable and inspired her to plan another one. Morgan's first political party being memorable does not necessarily relate to her desire to plan another tea party."}}
{"Q": "I found a $600 dollar envelope in the mail today. Which event could cause I am dishonest?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I donated all of the money to charity. (B) I decided to keep it even if it wasn't mine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Keeping the money even if it wasn't yours is a more plausible answer for being dishonest as it involves taking something that doesn't belong to you. Donating the money to charity shows honesty and integrity."}}
{"Q": "Elizabeth bought four fish from the pet store. Which event could cause Elizabeth had to give many of the fish away to new homes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Elizabeth's fish tank was too fat. (B) Elizabeth noticed they had babies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Elizabeth's fish tank was too small, she would have realized that before buying the fish. However, if she noticed that her fish had babies, the tank may become overcrowded and she may need to give some of the fish away to new homes to ensure they all have enough space to live comfortably."}}
{"Q": "Tina's friend was making some guacamole. Which event could cause Tina decided to make it herself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tina really messed it up. (B) Tina watched her friend. Her friend didn't even peel the avocados.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tina watched her friend make guacamole without even peeling the avocados, she may have realized that she could make it herself and do a better job. This event would be more plausible than Tina messing it up, as it is unlikely that she would want to try again if she had already failed at making it."}}
{"Q": "Greg loves girl scout cookies. Which event could cause He is immediately regretful?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Greg eats too few girl scout cookies. (B) Greg tried a new flavor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Greg tries a new flavor and ends up not liking it, he may feel regretful for not sticking to his usual favorite flavor. Eating too few cookies may not cause immediate regret, but rather disappointment or a desire for more."}}
{"Q": "Glenn decided to try a new mexican restaurant. Which event could cause Needless to say Glenn was satisfied with his new experience?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was cheap and very delicious. (B) The restaurant served lasagna.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Glenn went to a Mexican restaurant, it is more plausible that he would be satisfied if the food was cheap and delicious, as this is a common expectation for Mexican cuisine. The fact that the restaurant served lasagna, which is an Italian dish, is not relevant to Glenn's satisfaction with his experience at a Mexican restaurant."}}
{"Q": "Johnny had a confession for a priest. Which event could cause The priest told Johnny women make sinners of us all?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Johnny told the priest about a dog. (B) Johnny told the priest he cheated on his wife.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the priest would make such a statement if Johnny confessed to committing adultery, which is considered a sin in many religions. Confessing about a dog would not likely lead to such a statement."}}
{"Q": "Alec works at the renaissance fair. Which event could cause They had to make it seem like part of the act?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alec jumped up in front of everyone. (B) Alec's phone started ringing during a performance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Alec's phone started ringing during a performance.\nExplanation: If Alec's phone started ringing during a performance, it would be a modern interruption that would not fit with the Renaissance theme. To avoid breaking the immersion for the audience, Alec and his colleagues would have to quickly incorporate the ringing phone into the act, making it seem like it was part of the show."}}
{"Q": "Matt wanted to go back in time. Which event could cause He never succeeded because time travel is probably impossible?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) matt had a drug problem but decided to try to build a time machine. (B) He built a time machine and went back to 1800.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The more plausible answer is that Matt built a time machine and went back to 1800, but he never succeeded because time travel is probably impossible. This is a more plausible answer because it is based on the assumption that time travel is impossible, which is a widely accepted scientific theory. On the other hand, the first option, that Matt had a drug problem but decided to try to build a time machine, is less plausible because it is not clear how a drug problem would lead to an attempt to build a time machine."}}
{"Q": "In 2005 I took my first roller coaster ride in thirty years. Which event could cause It was a great ride and I am no longer afraid of roller coasters?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Since it had been so soon, I was a little afraid. (B) I thought it would be too scary and loud.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Since it had been so soon, I was a little afraid.\nExplanation: It is common for people to develop fears or phobias after a traumatic experience. In this case, the person had not ridden a roller coaster in thirty years, so it is understandable that they may have been a little afraid. However, since they enjoyed the ride and are no longer afraid of roller coasters, it is unlikely that the event that caused their fear was too traumatic or severe."}}
{"Q": "Today we went on a plane ride. Which event could cause I am no longer afraid of planes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We took a return flight back home and there was no turbulence. (B) I love planes. But we took off and wrecked.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Taking a return flight back home with no turbulence would be a positive experience that could help alleviate fear of planes. On the other hand, experiencing a plane crash would likely reinforce or intensify the fear. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Every Tuesday I meet my grandfather for coffee. Which event could cause Our coffee time ended early so he could go home and take a nap?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My grandfather was sleepy. (B) I got very tired.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My grandfather was sleepy.\nExplanation: Since the statement mentions that the coffee time ended early so that the grandfather could go home and take a nap, it is more plausible that he was the one who was feeling sleepy and needed to rest. It is less likely that the narrator got tired since it is a regular event and they would have planned accordingly."}}
{"Q": "Kaya needed to buy a new dress for the upcoming Spring Formal. Which event could cause It was kind of expensive but she decided it was worth it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kaya saw a unique dress that would perfectly fit the Spring Formal occasion. (B) Kaya went shopping for her dress at the dollar store.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Kaya saw a unique dress that would perfectly fit the Spring Formal occasion.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kaya would spend more money on a dress that she felt was unique and perfect for the occasion rather than settling for a cheap dress from the dollar store. The Spring Formal is likely an important event for Kaya, and she would want to look her best."}}
{"Q": "Sue needs a haircut. Which event could cause Sue goes home and cries about her haircut?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sue's hair was cut too lasting. (B) Sue went to a beauty school to get it cut.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Sue's hair was cut too short, she may feel upset and cry about it. Going to a beauty school to get a haircut is not necessarily a reason for Sue to cry, as many beauty schools have trained professionals who can give good haircuts."}}
{"Q": "A tree fell in Ray's backyard. Which event could cause Every time he opened the shed he recited the poem?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ray had to get the machine saw in the shed, but the door was hard to open. (B) Ray made the tree into a house and wrote a poem.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ray recited the poem every time he opened the shed because he had to struggle with the door, rather than him making a tree into a house and writing a poem. The former scenario is a common human behavior where people tend to repeat certain actions or phrases when faced with a challenging situation, while the latter scenario is less likely to happen."}}
{"Q": "Timothy loved to dance. Which event could cause Everyone loved his dancing and he won the contest?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Timothy joined a dancing session. (B) Timothy participated in a dancing contest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Timothy participated in a dancing contest.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Timothy would win a dancing contest rather than just joining a dancing session. Winning a contest implies that he had some level of skill and talent, and that he stood out among the other participants. Additionally, the fact that \"everyone loved his dancing\" suggests that he was performing in front of a larger audience, which is more likely to happen at a contest rather than a casual dancing session."}}
{"Q": "Eric got a new cell phone. Which event could cause The teacher laughed so much that he didn't care about punishing Eric?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eric's farting noise ringtone went off while he farted. (B) Erics phone rang in class.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Eric's farting noise ringtone went off while he farted.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it involves a humorous situation that could cause the teacher to laugh so much that they forget about punishing Eric. On the other hand, Eric's phone ringing in class is a common occurrence and would not necessarily be funny enough to cause the teacher to laugh so much."}}
{"Q": "Sarah woke early to do her chores around the house. Which event could cause Sarah's husband came home with flowers to cheer her up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sarah started laundry when the washer broke and the vacuum cleaner shorted out. (B) Sarah felt the cheeriest and happiest in ages.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it presents a problem that Sarah encountered while doing her chores, which could have caused her to feel stressed or frustrated. Her husband may have noticed this and brought her flowers to cheer her up. Option B does not provide any reason for Sarah's husband to bring her flowers, as feeling happy and cheerful is not necessarily a reason for someone to receive flowers."}}
{"Q": "Sam was riding the bus. Which event could cause After a while the music had him completely relaxed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The bus ran a red light and crashed into another car. (B) Sam was nervous about the bus ride.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sam was nervous about the bus ride.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sam's nervousness about the bus ride caused him to listen to music to relax, rather than a sudden and traumatic event like a bus crash. Additionally, the sentence \"After a while the music had him completely relaxed\" suggests a gradual process rather than a sudden event."}}
{"Q": "Ian was at his friend's house. Which event could cause Ian had to walk home in the dark?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He gladly took a ride home. He needed to get the exercise. (B) Ian stayed at his friends house too long and it was dark out when he left.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Ian stayed at his friend's house too long, it is plausible that it could have gotten dark by the time he left. This would require him to walk home in the dark. Choice (A) is less likely because if Ian gladly took a ride home, he would not have had to walk home in the dark."}}
{"Q": "Stu tore his sisters penguin plushie while arguing with her. Which event could cause When he them to his sister, she forgot about the penguin completely?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Stu didn't apologize. (B) Stu bought his sister a whole bunch of penguin plushies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Stu bought his sister a whole bunch of penguin plushies.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Stu's sister would forget about the torn penguin plushie if Stu made an effort to make it up to her by buying her multiple replacements. This shows that he is sorry for what he did and is trying to make amends. Simply not apologizing would likely make the situation worse and cause his sister to hold onto the memory of the torn plushie."}}
{"Q": "Bob wanted a hamburger. Which event could cause Bob went out to McDonald's later that evening?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob waited patiently and resisted the urge to order online. (B) Bob got in a hurry and ran outside to go grab a burger.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Bob waited patiently and resisted the urge to order online, it is more likely that he would plan to go out later to get a hamburger. On the other hand, if Bob got in a hurry and ran outside to go grab a burger, it suggests that he was already in a rush and may not have had the intention to go to McDonald's specifically."}}
{"Q": "John thought he was the best video game player ever. Which event could cause John learned he wasn't as good as he thought he was?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John challenged Benny and lost. (B) A lot people lost to John at video games.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. John challenged Benny and lost.\nExplanation: If John challenged Benny and lost, it would be a clear indication that he wasn't as good as he thought he was. Losing to one person who is better than him would be more convincing than winning against a lot of people who may not be as skilled as Benny."}}
{"Q": "Joey took his kite to the park. Which event could cause He had a great time flying his kite all afternoon?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The wind was brisk and the park was empty. (B) He let go of the string and the kite flew away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The wind being brisk would make it easier for Joey to fly his kite and enjoy it. Additionally, the park being empty would mean that there were no obstacles or distractions for him while flying his kite. On the other hand, if he had let go of the string and the kite flew away, it would have been a negative experience for him and not a great time."}}
{"Q": "Chris wanted to try out for the school soccer team. Which event could cause Chris made the soccer team?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chris practiced before the tryouts. (B) The coach showed up to tryouts and impressed Chris.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Chris practiced before the tryouts.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Chris making the soccer team was a result of his preparation and hard work through practicing before the tryouts. While the coach's presence may have had an impact, it is not a guarantee that Chris would make the team solely based on that. Practicing and improving his skills would have given Chris a better chance of impressing the coach during tryouts."}}
{"Q": "Ronald had a girlfriend named Stephanie. Which event could cause Ronald didn't care, he was planning to kill Stephanie later?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ronald hated Stephanie very much. (B) Stephanie loved Ronald very much.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Ronald hated Stephanie very much, it could be a possible reason for him to plan to kill her. Hatred can lead to extreme actions and violence. On the other hand, if Stephanie loved Ronald very much, it would not make sense for Ronald to plan to kill her. Love is not a motive for murder."}}
{"Q": "They reached the eastern boundary of the wilderness at noon. Which event could cause Zeke sold the images to doctor offices for a tidy sum of money?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Zeke took many pictures of the beautiful scenery. (B) Zeke took videos of local animals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Zeke took many pictures of the beautiful scenery.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Zeke sold images of the beautiful scenery he captured while reaching the eastern boundary of the wilderness. This is because scenic images are often used for decoration in doctor offices and other professional settings. Videos of local animals may not be as useful for this purpose."}}
{"Q": "Alex needed groceries. Which event could cause She bought the groceries?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She went to the grocery store. (B) Alex went to the auto shop.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She went to the grocery store.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alex bought groceries because she went to the grocery store, rather than going to the auto shop. The auto shop is not a place where one would typically buy groceries, so it is unlikely that Alex would have bought groceries there."}}
{"Q": "Joe went to the movie theater to see the new movie. Which event could cause Joe casually walked into the movie and gave a sigh?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The movie theater didn't have tickets for the new movie. (B) Joe was full of lots of energy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The movie theater didn't have tickets for the new movie.\nExplanation: If the movie theater didn't have tickets for the new movie, Joe would have been disappointed and may have casually walked in and given a sigh. On the other hand, if Joe was full of lots of energy, he would have been excited and may have walked in with enthusiasm rather than casually and giving a sigh. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Audrey was afraid to try new foods. Which event could cause Audrey surprisingly fell in love with their restaurant and food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Audrey decided to work up the courage to try a new store near her house. (B) Audrey went to a new style of restaurant.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Audrey deciding to work up the courage to try a new store near her house is a more plausible answer because it suggests that Audrey is taking a small step towards trying new things. Going to a completely new style of restaurant may be too overwhelming for someone who is afraid to try new foods. Trying a new store near her house may be less intimidating and could lead to Audrey discovering new foods that she enjoys."}}
{"Q": "Tony was making a pizza in his restaurant. Which event could cause Tony grabbed his special fire extinguisher, and put out the flames?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tony forgot about the pizza while prepping the chicken, and it burned up and it tasted really bad. (B) Tony placed the pizza in the oven without setting a timer. His pizza caught flames after an hour of cooking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tony placed the pizza in the oven without setting a timer, it is possible that he forgot about it and it caught flames. This is a more plausible scenario for Tony to grab his special fire extinguisher and put out the flames. In contrast, if Tony forgot about the pizza while prepping the chicken, it is unlikely that the pizza would catch flames and require the use of a fire extinguisher."}}
{"Q": "George hated going to school. Which event could cause She was very upset and took George home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) George Playedx hooky all time and lied to Sara.People don't lik. (B) George refused to get out of the anti-ride at school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: George refusing to get out of the anti-ride at school seems like a more plausible reason for Sara to be upset and take him home. Playing hooky and lying may cause disapproval from others, but it doesn't necessarily explain why Sara would take him home. Refusing to get out of a ride could be seen as a safety concern or disruptive behavior, which would warrant being taken home."}}
{"Q": "Everyone in my family got together for Thanksgiving. Which event could cause We all eventually couldn't stop arguing with one another?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My family disagreed about politics. (B) My one another did not get along well with family.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Politics can be a sensitive and divisive topic, especially during a time when emotions are already heightened. It is not uncommon for disagreements about politics to lead to arguments and tension within families, which could eventually escalate into a full-blown argument. On the other hand, while not getting along with family members can also cause tension, it is less likely to cause a widespread argument among everyone in the family."}}
{"Q": "Kim loves to swim. Which event could cause She saved up enough and now has a pool in her backyard?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kim decided to get a backyard. (B) Kim got a second job and banked all her paychecks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Kim got a backyard pool.\nExplanation: Option (A) is not a plausible answer as it does not explain how Kim was able to save up enough money to get a pool in her backyard. Option (B) is also not a plausible answer as it suggests that Kim had to work extra hard to save up for the pool, which may not be necessary. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Kim saved up enough money to get a pool in her backyard."}}
{"Q": "Matt collected acorns. Which event could cause Matt happily gave all of his acorns to the hungry squirrel?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There was a squirrel scavenging for acorns next to Matt. (B) Matt saw a skinny girl.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Matt gave his acorns to the hungry squirrel because he saw a squirrel scavenging for acorns next to him. This event directly relates to the action of giving his acorns to the squirrel, whereas seeing a skinny girl does not necessarily have a direct connection to giving away his acorns."}}
{"Q": "Kathy was responsible for buying the groceries. Which event could cause Now Kathy never goes shopping without planning and a list?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She always used to forget things. (B) Kathy spent a lot of money, and still does.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Kathy always used to forget things when she went shopping, it would make sense for her to start planning and making a list to avoid forgetting anything important. On the other hand, spending a lot of money may not necessarily lead to Kathy becoming more organized in her shopping habits."}}
{"Q": "Ed liked to drink, but he often got carried away. Which event could cause Ed has not touched a drink since her birth, seven years ago?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ed didn't mind and continued to drink every night. (B) Ed wanted to be a good father when his daughter was born.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ed wanted to be a good father when his daughter was born and decided to stop drinking, rather than continuing to drink every night despite having a new responsibility as a parent. The birth of a child can be a life-changing event and can motivate individuals to make positive changes in their behavior."}}
{"Q": "The phone rang and I answered it. Which event could cause That's how I met your mother?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was a wrong number who had lovely voice. (B) It wasn't a girl named Sarah.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) It was a wrong number who had lovely voice.\nExplanation: This event could lead to the protagonist striking up a conversation with the person on the other end of the line, who turns out to be a woman with a lovely voice. They may continue talking and eventually meet in person, leading to a potential romantic relationship and the possibility of meeting the protagonist's future spouse (i.e. \"your mother\"). This scenario is more plausible than option (B), which does not provide any clear indication of how the protagonist could meet their future spouse."}}
{"Q": "Troy got a Great Dane pup last Friday. Which event could cause He's spent hours every day trying to train him since then?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The puppy was very kind. (B) The puppy tore up the pillows and destroyed his model airplane.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The puppy tore up the pillows and destroyed his model airplane.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause Troy to spend hours every day trying to train his Great Dane pup because it shows that the puppy has destructive behavior that needs to be corrected. Troy may be trying to teach the puppy what is acceptable behavior and what is not, in order to prevent further destruction of his belongings. If the puppy had been very kind, Troy may still want to train him, but it may not require as much time and effort."}}
{"Q": "Greg was at home bored. Which event could cause Greg was happy he wasn't bored anymore?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Greg's friend came over to invite him to a class lecture. (B) Greg decided to go buy a video game.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Greg's friend came over to invite him to a class lecture.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it involves a social interaction and a potential opportunity for learning or intellectual stimulation. It also suggests that Greg has a friend who cares about him and wants to include him in activities, which could improve his mood and alleviate his boredom. Buying a video game may provide temporary entertainment, but it does not address the underlying issue of boredom and may not have a lasting impact on Greg's happiness."}}
{"Q": "Billy was five Year's old. Which event could cause Billy got a quarter from the tooth-fairy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) billy pulled one of his tooth. (B) He finally got his first tooth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that Billy received a quarter from the tooth-fairy because he pulled one of his teeth, rather than simply getting his first tooth. The tradition of the tooth-fairy leaving money under a child's pillow is typically associated with losing a tooth, not gaining one."}}
{"Q": "Rita was having a very difficult time at work. Which event could cause Their relationships improved?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) For a time, her co-worker was challenging. (B) For a time, her co-worker reached out and helped.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) For a time, her co-worker reached out and helped.\nExplanation: If Rita's co-worker reached out and helped her during her difficult time at work, it could have improved their relationship. This act of kindness and support could have created a bond between them and increased trust and respect. On the other hand, if her co-worker was challenging, it is less likely that their relationship would have improved."}}
{"Q": "It had snowed the night before. Which event could cause Afterwards, he was able to successfully back out his car?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John had to shovel the rain on the driveway. (B) Bob dug his car out of the snow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Bob dug his car out of the snow.\nExplanation: Since it had snowed the night before, it is more likely that the car was covered in snow and needed to be dug out rather than rain causing a need for shoveling. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gary had trouble drinking enough water throughout the day. Which event could cause He decided to ditch the alarm clock?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He tried using a receiver to remind him. (B) It felt like a chore to Gary to drink a glass of water every time his alarm went off.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It felt like a chore to Gary to drink a glass of water every time his alarm went off.\nExplanation: If Gary found it tedious to drink water every time his alarm went off, he might have decided to ditch the alarm clock altogether. This option seems more plausible than (A) because using a receiver to remind him would not necessarily solve the problem of finding it a chore to drink water."}}
{"Q": "We went camping on time when I was younger. Which event could cause We made sure to not go back there again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A bug tried to enter our tent while we were sleeping. (B) it wasn't always the most fun times however.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. A bug tried to enter our tent while we were sleeping.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause discomfort and fear, especially if the bug was a dangerous or venomous one. It could have also disrupted their sleep and made the camping experience unpleasant. On the other hand, option B is too vague and doesn't provide a clear reason for not wanting to go back to the camping site."}}
{"Q": "Sam loved breakfast. Which event could cause Sam decided to never eat waffles again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam made his waffles and had to eat so many that morning. (B) Sam accidentally burnt waffles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: While eating too many waffles could make Sam feel sick, it is unlikely to make him swear off waffles forever. On the other hand, burning the waffles could leave a bad taste in Sam's mouth and make him associate waffles with a negative experience, leading him to avoid them in the future."}}
{"Q": "Joe robbed a bank. Which event could cause Soon Joe got caught?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The workers didnt call the police. (B) Joe tried to excape.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Joe tried to escape, it would increase the chances of getting caught by the police. The workers not calling the police may delay the capture, but it is not a guarantee that Joe will not get caught eventually. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jane lost her dog. Which event could cause Jane was glad and excited?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Someone hide the dog from her. (B) Jane then found her dog.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jane then found her dog.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jane would be glad and excited if she found her lost dog rather than someone hiding the dog from her. Finding her dog would bring a sense of relief and happiness to Jane, while someone hiding the dog would only cause more stress and worry."}}
{"Q": "One day snow and ice covered the ground. Which event could cause Thankfully Jimmy was okay?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jimmy didn't notice and slipped on the ice. (B) Jimmy was careful not to slip on the snow and ice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jimmy was careful not to slip on the snow and ice, then it is more likely that he would not have fallen and gotten hurt. Therefore, it is more plausible that he was okay because he was cautious and aware of the slippery conditions."}}
{"Q": "One Saturday spring morning, I loaded up to play golf with the guys. Which event could cause When I visited him at the hospital, the nurse said he will be okay?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My friend got hit in the head by a falling acorn. (B) My friend got hit in the head by a gold ball.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My friend got hit in the head by a falling acorn.\nExplanation: While it is possible for someone to get injured by a golf ball, it is much more likely for someone to get hit by a falling acorn while outside in the spring. Additionally, the fact that the nurse said he will be okay suggests that the injury was not too severe, which is more likely with an acorn than a golf ball."}}
{"Q": "Ann loved cake. Which event could cause Ann came inside and watched as cakes were being made?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The local baker let Ann come into the workshop for a tour. (B) She passed by a meat shop one day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it involves a cake being made, which is Ann's favorite food. Option B mentions a meat shop, which is not related to cake making and does not provide a reason for Ann to come inside and watch cakes being made. Option A also mentions a local baker allowing Ann to come into the workshop for a tour, which is a more reasonable explanation for Ann's presence."}}
{"Q": "Max decides that he spends too much money buying food at restaurants. Which event could cause He is very happy to be saving money by cooking at home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Max found some great recipes to cook at home. (B) Max starts to learn how to drive stick shift.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Max found some great recipes to cook at home.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because finding great recipes to cook at home would directly lead to Max being happy to save money by cooking at home. Learning how to drive stick shift, on the other hand, is not directly related to saving money on food expenses."}}
{"Q": "There are two phases to body building. Which event could cause Apparently if you do these two things you will look amazing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A good diet isn't needed, just exercise. (B) It is important that you work on both phases.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. It is important that you work on both phases. \nExplanation: Body building consists of two phases - building muscle through exercise and maintaining a healthy diet. Neglecting either of these phases can hinder progress and results. Therefore, it is important to focus on both aspects in order to achieve the desired physique."}}
{"Q": "Robbie was confused by his homework. Which event could cause Robbie felt lonely and sat down to cry?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Robbie kept getting different math answers for same problem. (B) Robbie stayed up all morning and couldn't finish it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: While staying up all morning to work on homework can be frustrating and tiring, it is less likely to cause someone to feel lonely and cry. However, getting different answers for the same problem can be confusing and make someone feel like they are not capable of completing the task, leading to feelings of loneliness and frustration."}}
{"Q": "Luis wanted to make money when he grew up. Which event could cause Now he has a good paying job and a nice family?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Luis brother stuck to his goals in life. (B) Luis attended university and studied very hard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Attending university and studying hard is a common path to obtaining a good paying job. It is also likely that Luis's education and hard work helped him develop the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in his career and provide for his family. While having a supportive family member like a brother can be helpful, it is not necessarily the determining factor in achieving financial success."}}
{"Q": "Tom was looking through his pantry for a snack. Which event could cause The bug crawled away and Tom lost his appetite?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He saw a huge bug crawl near him, and he hates bugs. (B) Tom found a coconut, but noticed that it had a worm hole.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Seeing a bug near him would likely cause Tom to lose his appetite, especially if he hates bugs. Finding a worm hole in a coconut may not necessarily cause Tom to lose his appetite, as he could simply cut around the hole and still eat the coconut."}}
{"Q": "Debbie lost her mother when Debbie was only 15. Which event could cause Debbie lived a long a fulfilling life with her husband and 4 boys?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Debbie met a man. (B) Debbie got over her own death.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Meeting a supportive and loving partner can provide emotional stability and a sense of security, which can help Debbie cope with the loss of her mother and lead a fulfilling life with her family. Getting over one's own death is not a plausible event as it is impossible."}}
{"Q": "Today was the first day of school. Which event could cause I hate school?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My teacher was mean and the other students laughed at my shirt. (B) I tried making tacos, but none seemed to like them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: A mean teacher and being laughed at by other students can be very discouraging and hurtful, especially on the first day of school. This can easily lead to a negative attitude towards school and a dislike for attending. On the other hand, not being able to make tacos that others like may be disappointing, but it is not directly related to school and would not likely cause a strong dislike for it."}}
{"Q": "I approached the bridge in the rainy, rounding a curve. Which event could cause I really came to appreciate that day how well that bridge was built?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I almost drove off but stopped before crossing. (B) I suddenly skidded and hit the side of the bridge.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that the road was wet and the driver was rounding a curve suggests that the conditions were not ideal for driving. If the driver almost drove off the bridge but was able to stop in time, it would highlight the importance of the bridge's construction and safety features. On the other hand, if the driver skidded and hit the side of the bridge, it would suggest that the bridge was not able to prevent accidents in adverse weather conditions, which would not make the driver appreciate the bridge's construction."}}
{"Q": "John went on a camping trip with his brother Mark. Which event could cause At that moment, a skunk walked right into their tent?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At the camping site, the brothers unloaded their car, put up the tent, and rolled out the sleeping bags. (B) John and Mark set up with their tent left at home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Choice (A) describes the brothers setting up their tent and getting settled at the camping site, which is a more plausible scenario for a skunk to walk into their tent. Choice (B) suggests that the brothers forgot their tent at home, which is unlikely to happen if they were planning a camping trip."}}
{"Q": "Paul's car broke down shortly after leaving the driveway. Which event could cause Paul then realized attempting repairs yourself can be expensive?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Paul decided to get a mechanic instead of fixing it himself. (B) Paul's repair had completely fallen apart.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Paul's car broke down shortly after leaving the driveway, it is unlikely that he had attempted any repairs before realizing that it can be expensive. Therefore, it is more plausible that he decided to get a mechanic instead of fixing it himself after the breakdown."}}
{"Q": "Oscar never made his bed. Which event could cause She yelled at him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His room was a mess and his dad saw it. (B) Oscar's mom asked him to make his bed every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Oscar's room was a mess and his dad saw it, it is more likely that his mom would yell at him for not making his bed. This is because his dad seeing the mess could have caused his mom to feel embarrassed or frustrated, leading her to take it out on Oscar. On the other hand, if his mom simply asked him to make his bed every day, it is less likely that she would yell at him unless he repeatedly ignored her requests."}}
{"Q": "Kayla was trying to come up with baby names for her baby. Which event could cause Now Kayla had a baby name they both liked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kayla’s husband hated all the names she mentioned. (B) Kayla went through the naming school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Kayla went through the naming school, she would have learned about different naming techniques and styles, which could have helped her and her husband come up with a name they both liked. On the other hand, if her husband hated all the names she mentioned, it would be unlikely that they would come up with a name they both liked without some compromise or outside help."}}
{"Q": "My friends and I went to six flags last weekend. Which event could cause I vowed to never go on it again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I vomited on the roller coaster. (B) I rode the roller coaster over and over.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Vomiting on a roller coaster is a common fear and experience for many people, and it would be a plausible reason for someone to vow to never go on that ride again. Riding a roller coaster over and over may be tiring or boring, but it is not typically a traumatic or fear-inducing experience that would lead someone to swear off the ride forever."}}
{"Q": "Jane admired the music of The Doors. Which event could cause Jane knew it was hard work, but persevered with her idols in mind?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jane decided she wanted to practice to play the guitar like Hendrix. (B) Jane wanted to become a musician too.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Jane admired the music of The Doors, it is more plausible that she would want to practice to play the guitar like Hendrix, who was a famous guitarist and contemporary of The Doors. This would require hard work and perseverance, as learning to play an instrument takes time and dedication. Wanting to become a musician too is a vague goal and does not necessarily require the same level of dedication and hard work as learning to play a specific instrument."}}
{"Q": "Henry was racing to get to work one morning. Which event could cause He handed Henry a ticket for speeding?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He got pulled over. (B) The police found him going under the speed limit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Henry was racing to get to work, it is more likely that he was driving over the speed limit and got pulled over by the police, resulting in a speeding ticket. It is less likely that he was driving under the speed limit and still received a ticket."}}
{"Q": "Sam went for a ride in Shanghai with his family. Which event could cause The man accepted, then ripped the dollar in front of his eyes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam didnt change the currency of money. (B) He tried to pay the driver in silver coins.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The man ripping the dollar in front of Sam's eyes could be a result of Sam not changing his currency to the local currency in Shanghai. The man may have been frustrated with Sam trying to pay with foreign currency and ripped the dollar in response. On the other hand, trying to pay with silver coins may not be a common occurrence and may not elicit such a strong reaction from the man."}}
{"Q": "The gavel rang out across the room after the sentence was given. Which event could cause I could feel the sharp bristles of the rope tighten around my neck?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was a life sentence without parole. I don't know if I can take life in prison. (B) I was sentenced to five years for my crimes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It was a life sentence without parole. \nExplanation: A life sentence without parole means that the person will spend the rest of their life in prison. This is a much harsher sentence than five years and could cause the person to feel the bristles of the rope tighten around their neck, symbolizing the weight of the sentence and the loss of their freedom for the rest of their life."}}
{"Q": "The river was full people rafting down on inner tubes. Which event could cause The guy looked around and wondered how long he was asleep?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) one guy fell asleep in his raft. (B) The guy woke down on his raft.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. The guy woke down on his raft.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the guy fell asleep while rafting down the river and woke up still on his raft, rather than one guy falling asleep in his raft causing the river to be full of people rafting down on inner tubes."}}
{"Q": "Paula goes on a dinner date. Which event could cause Paula waits around to get the waiters number?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Paula is more attracted to the waiter than her date. (B) She doesn't likes her date and not the waiter .", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Paula is more attracted to the waiter than her date.\nExplanation: If Paula is more attracted to the waiter than her date, she may wait around to get his number. However, if she doesn't like her date or the waiter, she is unlikely to wait around for either of their numbers. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Paul realized he was becoming less healthy in his old age. Which event could cause He was very happy to have adopted a healthier lifestyle?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He joined a library and spoke to a nutritionist. (B) He joined a gym and spoke to a nutrionist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Joining a gym and speaking to a nutritionist are more likely to lead to a healthier lifestyle than just joining a library and speaking to a nutritionist. Exercise is an important component of a healthy lifestyle, and joining a gym would provide Paul with access to equipment and classes to help him stay active. Additionally, speaking to a nutritionist would give him personalized advice on how to improve his diet and make healthier choices."}}
{"Q": "Martin was a friendly guy. Which event could cause She dried her eyes, smiled, and waved back?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Martin waved to the sad girl wqlking by. (B) Martin met a crying girl. She gave Martin a candy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The event of Martin waving to the sad girl walking by is more likely to cause the girl to dry her eyes, smile, and wave back. Martin's friendly gesture could have lifted the girl's spirits and made her feel acknowledged and seen. On the other hand, meeting a crying girl and receiving a candy from her may not necessarily lead to the girl drying her eyes, smiling, and waving back."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was happy to have her new phone. Which event could cause Kelly bought a new phone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She didn't like it after she brought it home. (B) She loved it once she brought it home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She loved it once she brought it home.\nExplanation: The sentence states that Kelly was happy to have her new phone, which implies that she is satisfied with her purchase. Therefore, it is more plausible that she loved the phone once she brought it home, rather than not liking it after bringing it home."}}
{"Q": "Mia sat at home in her living room watching sports. Which event could cause Mia cheered loudly and thought that she helped score that goal?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mia held her breath as her team was about to score, so that she wouldn't jinx it. (B) Suddenly the power went out during the biggest play!.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mia held her breath as her team was about to score, so that she wouldn't jinx it.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because it shows Mia's excitement and involvement in the game, but also her superstitions and belief in not jinxing her team's success. Cheering loudly and feeling like she helped score the goal is a common feeling among sports fans who are emotionally invested in their team's success. On the other hand, sudden power outages during a game are rare and unlikely to cause someone to feel like they helped score a goal."}}
{"Q": "Mary like to feed the pigeons on her roof. Which event could cause Mary went back downstairs and hoped for the pigeons return?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary climbed to the rooftop to scatter some seeds. (B) But tramping up there drew them closer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) But tramping up there drew them closer. \nExplanation: If Mary's presence on the rooftop scared the pigeons away, then it is likely that she would go back downstairs and hope for their return. Option (A) suggests that Mary had already scattered seeds, so there would be no reason for her to go back downstairs. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sally drives everyday to work. Which event could cause Luckily she stopped in time, but almost hit the kitten?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sally hit the gas when a kitten crossed in front. (B) Sally's almost could not stop when she pressed her breaks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Sally hit the gas when a kitten crossed in front.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because it is common for drivers to accidentally hit the gas pedal instead of the brake pedal when they are surprised by something unexpected, such as a kitten crossing the road. It is also fortunate that Sally was able to stop in time, indicating that she was likely driving at a safe speed and paying attention to her surroundings. On the other hand, option (B) suggests that Sally's brakes were not functioning properly, which is less likely given that she drives to work every day and would likely have noticed any issues with her brakes before this incident."}}
{"Q": "Herman was getting tired of his store-bought coffee. Which event could cause He kept improving, and in time was brewing great coffee?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Herman decided to grind his own coffee beans. (B) Herman decided to visit a coffee shop everyday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Herman decided to grind his own coffee beans.\nExplanation: Grinding your own coffee beans is a common way to improve the taste of your coffee. By grinding the beans yourself, you can control the coarseness of the grind and ensure that the coffee is fresh. This can lead to a significant improvement in the taste of the coffee, which could explain why Herman was able to brew great coffee after making this change. Visiting a coffee shop everyday may expose Herman to different types of coffee, but it is unlikely to improve the taste of his store-bought coffee at home."}}
{"Q": "Fred decided to walk home from school one day. Which event could cause Luckily, he ran into a classmate who invited him inside?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It started down pouring. (B) It was sunny out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It started down pouring.\nExplanation: If it started down pouring, Fred would likely seek shelter and may have been invited inside by his classmate to avoid getting wet. On a sunny day, there would be no need for Fred to seek shelter and his classmate may not have invited him inside."}}
{"Q": "Yesterday my iron broke. Which event could cause Thankfully I got a new one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I attempted to fix it myself. (B) I dont need an iron anymore to look good for work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the person attempted to fix the iron themselves, they may have caused further damage or realized it was beyond repair, leading them to purchase a new one. Option B is not a plausible answer as looking presentable for work typically requires ironing clothes."}}
{"Q": "A bear wandered through the woods. Which event could cause Satisfied with the catch and the fish it returned home to sleep?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The bear was looking for shelter and headed to the mountains. (B) The bear caught some fish and ate it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible event that could cause the bear to be satisfied with its catch and return home to sleep is that it caught some fish and ate it. This is a natural behavior for bears, as they often hunt and fish for food before returning to their dens to rest. The option of the bear looking for shelter and heading to the mountains is less likely to cause the bear to be satisfied with its catch and return home to sleep."}}
{"Q": "Alice needed a new computer. Which event could cause Alice was upset to leave the store without a new computer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Alice could not find a well priced computer. (B) Alice searched around the computer store to find a broken computer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Alice could not find a well priced computer.\nExplanation: If Alice was unable to find a computer that fit her budget, she would be upset about leaving the store without a new computer. On the other hand, searching for a broken computer would not be a desirable outcome for Alice, so it is less likely to cause her to be upset."}}
{"Q": "Ana needed gas in her car. Which event could cause Ana filled her tank at the reservation?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ana decided to go to her local convenience store. (B) Gas was cheaper at the reservation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Gas was cheaper at the reservation.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ana would go to the reservation to fill up her tank if gas was cheaper there. It is unlikely that she would go to a convenience store just to fill up her tank unless she needed to buy something else as well."}}
{"Q": "May came home and saw her flower vase broken. Which event could cause May didn't believe him but he swore it wasn't his fault?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) May accused her roommate of breaking the vase. (B) May blamed her boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) May accused her roommate of breaking the vase.\nExplanation: Since May didn't see who broke the vase, she may have assumed that her roommate was the only other person who could have done it. Her boyfriend may not have been present at the time, so it wouldn't make sense for her to blame him. Therefore, it is more plausible that May accused her roommate of breaking the vase, leading to her not believing him when he swore it wasn't his fault."}}
{"Q": "Sam was working in the garden. Which event could cause He got her a terrarium and has kept her as a pet ever since?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam found a cat in the garden. (B) Sam found a frog.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sam found a frog.\nExplanation: Finding a frog in the garden is a more plausible event that could lead to Sam getting a terrarium and keeping it as a pet. Frogs are commonly found in gardens and can be kept as pets in terrariums. On the other hand, finding a cat in the garden is less likely and it is not common to keep cats in terrariums."}}
{"Q": "Lyn spoke with a stutter. Which event could cause In a few months, it had vanished entirely?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lyn sought treatment and it helped. (B) Lyn decided to get acting lessons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lyn sought treatment and it helped.\nExplanation: Stuttering is a speech disorder that can be treated with therapy and other interventions. Seeking treatment can help individuals learn techniques to improve their speech and reduce stuttering. It is unlikely that taking acting lessons would have a significant impact on reducing stuttering, as stuttering is a neurological condition and not related to acting ability. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Dan and Stan were playing mini-golf against each other. Which event could cause Stan concentrated on his final stroke and got a hole in one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Can was in the lead. (B) Stan was not in the lead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Stan was not in the lead, he may not have felt as much pressure to make a hole in one on his final stroke. However, if Stan was behind and knew he needed to make a hole in one to tie or win the game, he may have concentrated more and been more focused on his final stroke, leading to a successful hole in one."}}
{"Q": "Derek has had it with dean. Which event could cause Dean did not talk to him again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Derek yelled at Dean. (B) Derek had a conversation with Dean.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Derek yelled at Dean.\nExplanation: Yelling at someone is a more aggressive and confrontational behavior that could cause the other person to feel hurt or offended. It is more likely to cause a rift in the relationship and make Dean not want to talk to Derek again. On the other hand, having a conversation with Dean could potentially resolve any issues or misunderstandings between them."}}
{"Q": "Bob had been grounded for receiving bad grades at school. Which event could cause Bob was able to return back to his room without his parents noticing?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob snuck out of his room. (B) Bob was getting yelled at when his parents got distracted, so he ran away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Bob snuck out of his room.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bob would sneak out of his room rather than running away while getting yelled at. Sneaking out would allow him to avoid detection and return to his room unnoticed. Running away while getting yelled at would likely result in his parents noticing and potentially extending his grounding."}}
{"Q": "Tom decided to go for a hike. Which event could cause Tom was able to finish his hike?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom left early in the night so he would have plenty of darkness. (B) A park ranger stopped Tom and warned of a baby fawn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it involves a potential obstacle that Tom could have encountered during his hike. It also shows that Tom was responsible and caring enough to heed the park ranger's warning and adjust his plans accordingly, which could have allowed him to successfully complete his hike. Option A, on the other hand, does not make much sense as hiking in darkness can be dangerous and it is unlikely that Tom would have purposely chosen to do so."}}
{"Q": "Joe went to the store to buy some dinner plates. Which event could cause Joe walked away and told no one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe knocked down and broke some of the plates. (B) He almost broke the plates he was going to buy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Joe almost broke the plates he was going to buy, he may have felt embarrassed or frustrated and decided to walk away without telling anyone. This is a more plausible scenario than Joe breaking some of the plates, as breaking plates would likely cause a commotion and require him to inform store staff."}}
{"Q": "I put the black plastic rose in a vase with water. Which event could cause After a few weeks the flower died?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I replaced it with a real rose. (B) It turns out it was actually a red rose, but I didn't know for awhile.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is (B) because if the plastic rose was replaced with a real rose, it would not have died after a few weeks. However, if the plastic rose was actually a red rose and not meant to be submerged in water, it could have slowly deteriorated and died over time."}}
{"Q": "Bob and Dave decided to go camping on the weekend. Which event could cause Dave chuckled and told Bob he was right about the trip?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob showed Dave all the camping supplies he previously bought. (B) Bob told a good time that they would have Dave.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Dave chuckling and admitting that Bob was right about the trip suggests that there was some doubt or disagreement about the camping trip beforehand. Option A, where Bob shows Dave all the camping supplies he previously bought, could have convinced Dave that the trip was well-prepared for and enjoyable. Option B, where Bob tells a good time they would have, may not necessarily have resolved any doubts or disagreements they had beforehand."}}
{"Q": "The puppy scratched at the door. Which event could cause The puppy looked very happy as it ran in the yard?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The puppy was very cold. (B) But nobody threatens the puppy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Option (B) is a more plausible answer because it suggests that the puppy is safe and not in any danger, which could make it happy and playful. Option (A) does not provide any explanation for why the puppy would be happy running in the yard, and it is unlikely that a cold puppy would be energetic and playful."}}
{"Q": "It was time for Mary to get a flu shot. Which event could cause Mary got flu the following week?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary died. (B) She decided to go shopping instead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She decided to go shopping instead.\nExplanation: Mary getting the flu the following week is more likely to be caused by her exposure to the flu virus, which can happen if she comes into contact with someone who is infected. Going shopping could increase her chances of being exposed to the virus, especially if she is in close proximity to other people who may be sick. On the other hand, Mary dying would not be a plausible cause for her getting the flu the following week."}}
{"Q": "Eric walked through the city park on his way to a bar. Which event could cause Eric ran off and hoped that he was not being chased?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eric saw a squirrel. (B) A man tried to rob Eric.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. A man tried to rob Eric.\nExplanation: While it is possible for someone to be afraid of squirrels, it is not a common fear that would cause someone to run off and hope they were not being chased. On the other hand, being robbed is a more plausible event that could cause someone to feel threatened and run away."}}
{"Q": "It wouldn't be untrue to say that Jim was a bit obsessive. Which event could cause The next morning, he saw that his little figurine had been moved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim put his painting in a special place that he liked. (B) Jim kept everything in its place.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jim kept everything in its place.\nExplanation: The fact that Jim kept everything in its place suggests that he had a strong desire for order and control. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would be upset or concerned if something was moved without his knowledge or permission, rather than him simply putting his painting in a special place that he liked."}}
{"Q": "Bill was recently invited to the movies with a coworker. Which event could cause Bill was mortified of horror movies, as he always has nightmares?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bill was happy to be invited by his co-worker. (B) Bill was not too happy to be not invited by his co-worker.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Bill was happy to be invited by his co-worker.\nExplanation: If Bill was happy to be invited, it is more likely that he would agree to go to the movies with his co-worker, even if he is mortified of horror movies. On the other hand, if he was not too happy to be not invited, he would not have to worry about watching a horror movie. Therefore, (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "The girls went to a bar. Which event could cause They got into the plane?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They went home and went to bed. (B) The girls met a millionaire who invited him on his plane.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The girls met a millionaire who invited him on his plane.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the girls met someone who offered them a ride on his private plane rather than randomly getting on a plane after going to a bar. Option (A) is also a possibility, but it does not directly relate to the question of how they got on a plane."}}
{"Q": "Maddie was feeling sick. Which event could cause On a tray, he had her medicine, and a surprise bowl of ice cream?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Maddie went to the doctor to be treated for her injury. (B) Maddie's boyfriend decided to take care of her while she was sick.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Maddie's boyfriend decided to take care of her while she was sick and brought her medicine and a surprise bowl of ice cream to make her feel better. Going to the doctor for an injury would not necessarily result in medicine and ice cream, and it is not specified that Maddie has an injury."}}
{"Q": "Yul needed to wrap a gift. Which event could cause Yul then stuck a bow on top of the box?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Yul drew on the box to decorate it, instead. (B) He put the gift in a bag.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He put the gift in a bag.\nExplanation: If Yul put the gift in a bag, it is more likely that he would stick a bow on top of the bag instead of the box. If he drew on the box to decorate it, he may have also added a bow, but it is less likely that he would skip the bow altogether. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kara found a ring on the ground. Which event could cause Kara was disappointed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kara incompleted it was a fake ring. (B) However, it wasn't a real diamond.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) However, it wasn't a real diamond.\nExplanation: If Kara was expecting the ring to be a real diamond and it turned out to be fake or not valuable, she would likely be disappointed. On the other hand, if she didn't have any expectations about the ring's value or authenticity, finding out it was fake wouldn't necessarily cause disappointment. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "This morning I was on the couch when I felt my nose start to drip. Which event could cause After a few moments, the bleeding finally stopped?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I quickly realized it was blood. (B) I noticed I had a large cut on my nose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I noticed I had a large cut on my nose.\nExplanation: If the nose was bleeding, it is more likely that there was a cut or injury to the nose that caused the bleeding to occur. Realizing it was blood may have been a secondary event after noticing the cut."}}
{"Q": "Lou liked to feed stray animals. Which event could cause The cat has been Lou's best companion since?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lou found found a tiger while feeding stray animals. (B) Lou left cat food outside his back porch every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Lou left cat food outside his back porch every day.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lou's best companion would be a stray cat that he fed regularly, rather than a tiger that he found while feeding stray animals. Leaving cat food outside his back porch every day would attract stray cats, and it is likely that one of them became attached to Lou and became his companion."}}
{"Q": "Sam had really bad social anxiety. Which event could cause Sam's social anxiety decreased after exposing herself to more people?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam had to go out and meet people to get rid of it. (B) Sam made an effort at trying to be alone more often.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Sam had to go out and meet people to get rid of it.\nExplanation: Exposure therapy is a common treatment for social anxiety disorder, where the individual is gradually exposed to anxiety-provoking situations until their anxiety decreases. Therefore, it is more plausible that Sam's social anxiety decreased after exposing herself to more people, rather than isolating herself more."}}
{"Q": "Sadie was excited. Which event could cause She knew there were millions of other publishing agencies to try?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She finished writing a book and sent it to one publisher. (B) Sadie was thrilled to get a top publishing agency to sign her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Sadie finished writing a book and sent it to one publisher, she would be excited about the possibility of getting published. However, she would also be aware that there are many other publishing agencies to try if the first one doesn't work out. Therefore, it is more plausible that this event would cause Sadie to feel excited but also aware of the competition in the publishing industry."}}
{"Q": "I just got my braces removed. Which event could cause Alas, I got a cavity soon after for eating too much gum?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I decided not to chew gum ever again. (B) I was thrilled to eat forbidden foods again.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I was thrilled to eat forbidden foods again.\nExplanation: After getting braces removed, many people are excited to eat foods that were previously off-limits. It is more plausible that the individual indulged in sugary foods, including gum, after having their braces removed, leading to a cavity. It is unlikely that someone would completely give up chewing gum altogether after having a cavity."}}
{"Q": "Tay was having a yard sale. Which event could cause After the sale she had made more than enough cash?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tay gave most of her things away. (B) Tay wanted to make enough money to buy a bike.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Tay wanted to make enough money to buy a bike, it is more likely that she would have priced her items reasonably and made an effort to sell as much as possible. Giving most of her things away would not result in making more than enough cash."}}
{"Q": "I had my college prom in The Field Museum Which event could cause He asked me to marry him, I said No?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My date was a sweet boy. (B) My date seemed to be loathing the dance more than me.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) My date was a sweet boy.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for saying no to a marriage proposal would be due to personal feelings towards the proposer, rather than the event location or the behavior of the date. Therefore, it is possible that the protagonist's date was a sweet boy, but she simply did not have romantic feelings for him."}}
{"Q": "Sahara was digging through the car. Which event could cause She was so mad at them for opening the game that she took it back?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She found the package holding the game she bought her son for his birthday. (B) She found her game had been closed tight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Sahara found the package holding the game she bought her son for his birthday, it would make sense for her to be upset that someone had opened it without her permission. This would also explain why she took the game back. On the other hand, finding her game had been closed tight doesn't seem like a strong enough reason for her to be so angry and take the game back."}}
{"Q": "Franklin was an only child and had never had a roommate before. Which event could cause They discovered they had a lot in common, and Franklin was reassured?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Franklin talked to his roommate. (B) He had to get a nanny for college.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Franklin talking to his roommate would allow them to get to know each other and potentially find common interests, leading to Franklin feeling reassured about living with someone else for the first time. Hiring a nanny for college (option B) is not a plausible event and does not relate to the situation at hand."}}
{"Q": "It was Judy's birthday. Which event could cause Candy came out and fell everywhere?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Judy has a pinata party. (B) A pinata full of candy was hitting Judy hanging in a tree.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Judy has a pinata party.\nExplanation: A pinata party is a common birthday celebration where a pinata filled with candy is hung up and children take turns hitting it with a stick until it breaks open and spills the candy inside. Therefore, it is more plausible that Candy came out and fell everywhere because Judy had a pinata party. Option B is less likely as it suggests that someone was hitting Judy with a pinata filled with candy, which is not a typical or safe way to celebrate a birthday."}}
{"Q": "It was starting to get cold outside. Which event could cause The Smith family was able to stay warm throughout the entire winter?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Smith family stored lots of canned food. (B) Dad, went out and started chopping wood for kindle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Dad, went out and started chopping wood for kindle.\nExplanation: Chopping wood for kindle is a common way to prepare for the winter season as it provides a source of heat for the family. Storing canned food may be helpful for food supply, but it does not directly address the issue of staying warm. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "A third base coach gave the wrong sign to a player on first. Which event could cause That was the third out and the inning was over?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The player rounded second as the left fielder threw the ball to the first baseman. (B) The player tried to steal second and was tagged out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the player tried to steal second and was tagged out, it would result in the third out and end the inning. However, if the player rounded second as the left fielder threw the ball to the first baseman, it would not necessarily result in the third out and end the inning."}}
{"Q": "Eli had been thinking about planting a garden. Which event could cause He realized that the work was worth it and was quite pleased?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eli worked all day in the cold sun planting flowers. (B) Over the summer Eli came to realize how much work keeping up on a garden was.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Eli worked all day in the cold sun planting flowers, he would have put in a lot of effort and hard work. Seeing the results of his labor would make him realize that the work was worth it and feel pleased with the outcome. On the other hand, option B suggests that Eli already knew how much work a garden required, so it wouldn't be a sudden realization that would make him feel pleased."}}
{"Q": "Alex was home alone on a Friday night. Which event could cause Three friends were there to visit him, and they had a wonderful night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alex was sad to spend the whole evening alone. (B) Alex,posted on facebook that he was lonely at home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Alex posted on Facebook that he was lonely at home.\nExplanation: If Alex posted on Facebook that he was lonely at home, his friends could have seen the post and decided to visit him. This is a more plausible explanation than Alex being sad to spend the whole evening alone, as it is possible that his friends were able to cheer him up and make the night wonderful."}}
{"Q": "Anna and her friends needed something to do. Which event could cause They still laughed and had fun?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They went to the park, but it was raining. (B) Her friends didn't want to go out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: They went to the park, but it was raining.\nExplanation: Even though the original plan of going to the park was ruined by the rain, Anna and her friends could have found other activities to do together, such as playing board games or watching movies indoors. This scenario still allows for the possibility of laughter and fun despite the unexpected change in plans. On the other hand, if Anna's friends didn't want to go out, it would be difficult for them to have a group activity and enjoy each other's company."}}
{"Q": "Julie had a coworker named Barry who loved to make trouble for others. Which event could cause Julie gave Barry a hug and thanked him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Barry one day helped Julie out during a crisis situation. (B) Barry apologized for making fun of her hair.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Julie would give Barry a hug and thank him if he helped her out during a crisis situation, as this would show that he is capable of being a supportive coworker and not just causing trouble. Apologizing for making fun of her hair may not be enough to warrant a hug and thank you from Julie."}}
{"Q": "I order a dinner meal by my local restaurant. Which event could cause Since I didn't have the money, the restaurant gave me a fine?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When the check arrived, I realized I did not have the money to pay for my meal. (B) I brought money in my wallet from home, and ate everything that was served.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If the customer realizes they don't have the money to pay for their meal when the check arrives, it is more plausible that the restaurant would give them a fine for not being able to pay. In option B, the customer brought money and ate everything, so there would be no reason for the restaurant to give them a fine."}}
{"Q": "We celebrated Chinese New Year on February 7th. Which event could cause We rang in the new year by watching a youtube video of fireworks?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We wanted to see mistletoe. (B) It was a very cold day so we opted to stay home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) We wanted to see mistletoe.\nExplanation: This answer is not plausible because mistletoe is not associated with Chinese New Year celebrations. On the other hand, fireworks are a traditional part of Chinese New Year celebrations, so it is more likely that we watched a video of fireworks to mark the occasion. Choice (B) is also not a plausible answer because the weather is not typically a factor in celebrating Chinese New Year."}}
{"Q": "Peter had bought his dad a watch for Christmas. Which event could cause But then his dad smiled and Peter knew he loved the gift?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was a long lost family member. (B) When he opened the gift, he showed no emotion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: When he opened the gift, he showed no emotion.\nExplanation: This event sets up the expectation that Peter's dad may not have liked the gift. Therefore, when his dad smiled, it is a clear indication that he loved the gift despite his initial lack of emotion. The other option, a long lost family member, is not related to the gift and does not provide a plausible explanation for why Peter's dad would smile and show love for the gift."}}
{"Q": "Joe and Rafael wanted to see who can cook better wings. Which event could cause The family agreed that Joe's wings were better?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe and Rafael had a dance-off in the backyard. (B) Joe and Rafael had a cook off later that week.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The event that could cause the family to agree that Joe's wings were better is a cook off between Joe and Rafael. This is because the family is judging their cooking skills, and a cook off would be the most appropriate event to determine who can cook better wings. A dance-off would not be relevant to their cooking skills and would not provide any basis for comparison."}}
{"Q": "A man went to a katare school to take lessons. Which event could cause The sensei blocked the attack and punched the foolish man?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The sensei fought the man. (B) The man fought the sen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The man fought the sensei.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man initiated the attack and the sensei blocked it and punched him in self-defense or to teach him a lesson. It is unlikely that the sensei would randomly attack the man without provocation."}}
{"Q": "I play violin and take a lot of orchestra auditions. Which event could cause I am now a member of the symphony and love my job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I decided to try to join the new symphony. I auditioned and they didn't take me. (B) I practice many hours a week.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I practice many hours a week.\nExplanation: It is more likely that consistent practice and dedication to improving one's skills would lead to success in orchestra auditions and ultimately becoming a member of the symphony. While auditioning for a new symphony and not being accepted could be a setback, it is not necessarily a determining factor in achieving one's goals."}}
{"Q": "Tom needed one more quarter for bus fare. Which event could cause He felt lucky as he headed to the bus stop?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom found a quarter on the ground. (B) An old lady gave Tom a quarter of a sandwich.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom found a quarter on the ground.\nExplanation: Finding a quarter on the ground is a common occurrence and could easily happen, making it a more plausible event than an old lady giving Tom a quarter of a sandwich. Additionally, finding the exact amount of money needed for bus fare would make Tom feel lucky and relieved."}}
{"Q": "Pablo likes to eat worms. Which event could cause Pablo enjoys worms and views them as a delicacy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was born in Thailand. (B) Pablo has been eating worms for two days.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Pablo has been eating worms for two days.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Pablo has developed a taste for worms after eating them for two days rather than his birthplace determining his food preferences. It is possible that he tried worms out of curiosity or necessity and found that he enjoyed the taste, leading him to view them as a delicacy."}}
{"Q": "Halloween was a couple weeks ago. Which event could cause I took all the leftover candy to work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My work had a lot of candy. (B) All of the candy is gone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for taking all the leftover candy to work is because the workplace had a lot of candy to begin with. If all the candy was gone, there would be no leftover candy to take to work."}}
{"Q": "Randy wanted to be in a band. Which event could cause Randy got to join the band as a singer?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Randy auditioned all around town for an acting job. (B) Randy went to a try out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Randy went to a try out.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Randy would join a band as a singer by attending a try out specifically for singers rather than auditioning for acting jobs all around town. The try out would give him the opportunity to showcase his singing skills and potentially impress the band members."}}
{"Q": "I never really enjoy Thanksgiving much due to not having much family. Which event could cause When we finished, we said our goodbyes and went home to sleep?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) After I got married my wife and I celebrated with my family. (B) I went to a friend's house this year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I went to a friend's house this year.\nExplanation: This option seems more plausible as the person did not mention getting married or having a spouse in the question. Going to a friend's house for Thanksgiving is a common alternative for those who do not have much family or do not want to spend the holiday alone. It also fits with the statement of saying goodbye and going home to sleep after the celebration."}}
{"Q": "I woke up at 7am. Which event could cause He had really awful breath?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I leaned over in bed and kissed my husband. (B) The mailman man ignored me for a package delivery.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I leaned over in bed and kissed my husband.\nExplanation: When we sleep, our mouth produces less saliva, which can lead to bad breath in the morning. If the person leaned over and kissed their husband, they would be able to smell their breath up close and notice if it was particularly bad. On the other hand, the mailman ignoring them for a package delivery would have no correlation with the person's breath."}}
{"Q": "Jan and Kim were both using the Montessori education model. Which event could cause Jan brought the books back?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jan borrowed some of the books from Kim. (B) Kim borrowed some books from Jan.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jan borrowed some of the books from Kim.\nExplanation: If Jan borrowed some of the books from Kim, it would make sense for her to bring them back once she was finished using them. On the other hand, if Kim borrowed some books from Jan, it wouldn't necessarily prompt Jan to bring her own books back. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sue had a really bad fever. Which event could cause She felt better the next day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sue decided to stay home and pretend to be sick. (B) Sue took the day off, took some aspirin and napped all day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Taking the day off, resting, and taking medication are common remedies for a fever. It is unlikely that pretending to be sick would actually make Sue feel better."}}
{"Q": "Laura had a passion for art. Which event could cause Laura was pleased to show people her art?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Laura worked hard learning to paint. (B) People saw Laura's art project and liked them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If people saw Laura's art project and liked them, it would give her a sense of validation and encouragement to continue pursuing her passion for art. This positive feedback would make her more confident in showing her art to others. While working hard to learn to paint is important, it may not necessarily lead to the desire to show others her art."}}
{"Q": "James was walking through the snow. Which event could cause He quickly ran home to change into new clothing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) James' hair got wet. (B) He slipped and fell in the mud.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. James' hair got wet.\nExplanation: If James' hair got wet, it could cause him to feel cold and uncomfortable, and he may want to change into dry clothing. On the other hand, slipping and falling in the mud may also cause him to want to change, but it is less likely to happen if he is walking through the snow."}}
{"Q": "One day, Jim and Tom went to the beach. Which event could cause Jim and Tom never had another hot dog after that day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They got food poisoning from some bad hamburgers. (B) The hot dogs Jim bought made them sick.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The hot dogs Jim bought made them sick.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the hot dogs they ate made them sick rather than the bad hamburgers they didn't eat. Additionally, if they got food poisoning from the hamburgers, it is unlikely that they would blame the hot dogs and never eat them again."}}
{"Q": "Monique was finishing a new novel. Which event could cause She took the copy and slapped Gary hard over the head with it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gary snuck up behind her and scared her because she was deeply involved in reading her novel. (B) She was testing Gary about it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gary's sudden appearance and attempt to startle Monique while she was deeply involved in reading her novel could cause her to react impulsively and hit him with the book. Testing Gary about it seems less likely to result in such a violent reaction."}}
{"Q": "My hobby is taking selfies in front of poets' graves. Which event could cause I took several selfies by this poet's grave?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My favorite was Maya Angelou. (B) I went to a grave and found a sports figures marker.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) My favorite was Maya Angelou.\nExplanation: Since the person's hobby is taking selfies in front of poets' graves, it is more plausible that they would take several selfies by their favorite poet's grave. Maya Angelou was a well-known poet and author, so it is likely that the person would have a strong interest in visiting her grave and taking multiple selfies. On the other hand, finding a sports figure's marker at a grave would not necessarily be related to the person's hobby and would not explain why they took several selfies."}}
{"Q": "Karen wanted to have a child of her own. Which event could cause She has never been happier in her life?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Karen eventually gave birth to a baby rabbit. (B) Karen asked her boyfriend if he would like one too and he said yes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option A is not a plausible answer as it is impossible for a human to give birth to a baby rabbit. Option B is more plausible as Karen's desire to have a child of her own is fulfilled when her boyfriend agrees to have a child with her, which would bring her immense happiness."}}
{"Q": "Tom had too many headphones. Which event could cause He never had a problem untangling headphones again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) it took him no time to untangle them. (B) Tom chose to go with wireless equipment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tom chose to go with wireless equipment, he would no longer have to deal with tangled wires, thus eliminating the problem of untangling headphones. This is a more plausible answer than option A, as it is unlikely that Tom suddenly became an expert at untangling headphones without any external factors."}}
{"Q": "I was bored in my room one day. Which event could cause I was still bored, so I stopped?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I decided to play some video games. (B) So I decided I would try juggling.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Playing video games is a more likely activity to alleviate boredom than trying to learn a new skill like juggling. Video games are a common form of entertainment and can easily distract someone from their boredom. On the other hand, juggling requires more effort and practice to master, so it is less likely to be a quick fix for boredom."}}
{"Q": "Today we went on a plane ride. Which event could cause I vowed to never get on a plane again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plane did not have a smooth flight. (B) And there was a fight over the game.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If the plane did not have a smooth flight, it could cause fear and anxiety in the individual, leading them to vow to never get on a plane again. On the other hand, a fight over a game, while unpleasant, is unlikely to be a traumatic enough event to cause someone to swear off flying altogether."}}
{"Q": "I opened up my sleeping bag I hadn't used in ten years. Which event could cause Thankfully though, I knew someone who could fix it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a mouse in my sleeping bag. (B) and there were a lot of moth holes in the material.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the sleeping bag would have moth holes after ten years of storage than a mouse being inside. Moths are known to damage fabrics and can easily get into stored items. Additionally, the fact that the speaker knew someone who could fix it suggests that it was a repairable issue, rather than a living creature inside the sleeping bag."}}
{"Q": "Jill always got bad grades in math. Which event could cause To her surprise, she got every question right?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jill studied really hard. (B) Jill studied really hard for her upcoming English test.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jill studied really hard.\nExplanation: If Jill studied really hard for her math test, it is plausible that she would do well and get every question right. On the other hand, studying hard for an English test would not necessarily improve her math skills. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Early Saturday morning as I sat reading my Bible a butterfly flew by. Which event could cause I watched her until she faded away and then resumed my study?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She moved as though she were dancing through the air. (B) SATURDAY MORNING AS I WOKE UP EARLY AND READING MY BIBLE ALWAYS.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The description of the butterfly moving as though it were dancing through the air suggests that it caught the person's attention and they watched it until it flew away. The second option about waking up early and reading the Bible is not a direct cause for watching the butterfly and does not provide a clear explanation for why the person resumed their study after it flew away."}}
{"Q": "Lucy had no clean clothes. Which event could cause Lucy fell in love with the feeling of a sweater, warm from the dryer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy decided to do her laundry. (B) Lucy threw away her sweater.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lucy decided to do her laundry.\nExplanation: If Lucy had no clean clothes, it is likely that she would need to do her laundry. Doing her laundry would result in clean clothes, including the possibility of a warm sweater from the dryer. It is unlikely that throwing away a sweater would cause Lucy to fall in love with the feeling of a warm sweater from the dryer."}}
{"Q": "Liz went to order her burger. Which event could cause She threw her burger away?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Liz realized it was not a burger. (B) Liz was not really hungry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Liz realized it was not a burger.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because if Liz realized that the burger she ordered was not actually a burger, she may have thrown it away due to dietary restrictions or personal preferences. On the other hand, if Liz was not really hungry, she could have simply saved the burger for later or given it to someone else."}}
{"Q": "Candice loves tacos. Which event could cause Candice stuck to her original taco recipe?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Candice tried a new taco recipe, but it tasted terrible. (B) Candice decided to buy some.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Candice tried a new taco recipe and it tasted terrible, she would likely be discouraged from trying new recipes and stick to her original recipe that she knows she enjoys. On the other hand, if she decided to buy tacos instead of making them, it wouldn't necessarily affect her original recipe."}}
{"Q": "Alex is a selfish man. Which event could cause Now, Alex is dating the girl and is very generous and sweet?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He changed his ways to find a boyfriend. (B) Alex met a girl that he really liked.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Alex met a girl that he really liked.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alex's change in behavior is due to meeting someone he genuinely cares about and wants to impress, rather than suddenly deciding to change his ways without any external influence. Falling in love can often inspire people to be more generous and kind, especially if they want to make a good impression on their partner."}}
{"Q": "Last week, my mother was frustrated because it seemed nothing worked. Which event could cause For half an hour she cried, and it suddenly powered on like magic?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her computer was just not working. (B) the power would not turn off in the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her computer was just not working.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that her frustration and tears were caused by her computer not working, as this is a common source of frustration for many people. Additionally, it is not uncommon for a computer to suddenly start working again after being turned off and on or after a period of time. On the other hand, a power outage or issue with the power in the house would not likely cause someone to cry for half an hour, and it is less likely that the power would suddenly come back on like magic."}}
{"Q": "Evie was at a fair. Which event could cause They were so pretty that she decided to buy one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Evie saw a captivating hat at a booth. (B) People with lots of hats saw Evie.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Evie saw a captivating hat at a booth.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Evie's decision to buy something. If she saw a captivating hat at a booth, it would make sense for her to want to buy it because it caught her attention and she found it attractive. On the other hand, the second option about people with lots of hats seeing Evie doesn't provide a clear reason for why she would decide to buy something."}}
{"Q": "Lucy had a test tomorrow at school and she barely studied. Which event could cause Lucy aced the test?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy was super smart and always paid attention in class. (B) Lucy decided to study next time for the final test.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Lucy is naturally smart and pays attention in class, she may have retained enough information to do well on the test despite not studying much. While studying is important, natural intelligence and attentiveness can also play a significant role in academic success. Option B suggests that Lucy did not study at all, which is unlikely to result in acing the test."}}
{"Q": "Peter decided to go for a walk. Which event could cause He headed home to change his clothes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Peter got wet in the dryness. (B) Halfway through his walk, it started pouring.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Halfway through his walk, it started pouring.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if Peter got wet in the dryness, he could have just continued his walk without needing to change his clothes. However, if it started pouring halfway through his walk, it would make sense for him to head home and change into dry clothes."}}
{"Q": "Marie decided to be in a school play. Which event could cause Marie was proud at the end when she got a standing ovation?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jennifer practiced her lines and emotions. (B) Marie read the script many times to remember every line.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Marie being proud at the end and receiving a standing ovation suggests that she performed well in the play. Reading the script many times to remember every line would have helped her deliver her lines confidently and accurately, which could have contributed to her success in the play. While Jennifer practicing her lines and emotions is also important, it does not necessarily guarantee a standing ovation or Marie's pride at the end."}}
{"Q": "Lisa noticed there was a new girl at school. Which event could cause Lisa was glad to help?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lisa looked like she was lost. (B) Lisa invited the new girl to sit down with her and eat lunch.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Lisa inviting the new girl to sit down with her and eat lunch shows that Lisa is friendly and welcoming, which is a more plausible reason for her to be glad to help than just noticing that the new girl looked lost. Inviting someone to sit with you at lunch is a common way to make new friends and help them feel included in a new environment."}}
{"Q": "Sam was mowing his front lawn. Which event could cause He placed them back into the nest in the tree?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam crushed bird eggs on his front lawn. (B) Sam spotted three baby birds on the ground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sam spotted three baby birds on the ground.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause Sam to place the baby birds back into their nest in the tree. If Sam had accidentally crushed bird eggs on his front lawn, it would not make sense for him to place them back into a nest."}}
{"Q": "Alicia wanted to go to Miami for her party. Which event could cause The girls were mad because it was supposed to be a girls trip?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Alicia invited a boy to go along. (B) But her little sister wouldn't let her go alone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Alicia invited a boy to go along, it would be understandable for the girls to be mad because it would no longer be a girls trip. However, if her little sister wouldn't let her go alone, it wouldn't make sense for the girls to be mad as it is out of Alicia's control."}}
{"Q": "Matt and his girlfriend went to Yosemite last May. Which event could cause They had a wonderful trip and are excited to return?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather was beautiful in Yosemite. (B) matt had a caught the stomach flu.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The weather was beautiful in Yosemite.\nExplanation: Good weather can greatly enhance a trip, especially to a place like Yosemite where outdoor activities are a big part of the experience. If the weather was beautiful, it's likely that Matt and his girlfriend were able to enjoy all the sights and activities they had planned, which would make them excited to return. On the other hand, if Matt had caught the stomach flu, it would have likely put a damper on their trip and made them less likely to want to return."}}
{"Q": "Lee begged her parents to let her stay up late. Which event could cause But by eleven o'clock, she had fallen fast asleep?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She wanted to wake up to swim. (B) Lee's parents said she could stay up till midnight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Lee's parents said she could stay up till midnight.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it suggests that Lee was given permission to stay up late, but she still fell asleep before the agreed-upon time. On the other hand, wanting to wake up to swim does not necessarily mean that Lee would stay up late, and it is not clear why this would cause her to fall asleep early."}}
{"Q": "Jeff learned how to play guitar at a very young age. Which event could cause They took the band on tour and became rockstars?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He clumsied everyday and became part of a band. (B) Jeff's parents liked listening to his band play.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) He clumsied everyday and became part of a band.\nExplanation: Option (A) suggests that Jeff's interest and skill in playing guitar led him to join a band, which eventually went on tour and became successful. This is a more plausible explanation than option (B), which simply states that Jeff's parents enjoyed listening to his band play, but does not provide any explanation for how they became rockstars."}}
{"Q": "A scientist discovers that there is a disease beginning to spread. Which event could cause They save the world?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They ignore the authorities. (B) The scientist creates a vaccine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The scientist creates a vaccine.\nExplanation: Creating a vaccine is the most plausible solution to saving the world from a spreading disease. Ignoring the authorities would only lead to chaos and further spread of the disease. The scientist has the knowledge and expertise to develop a vaccine that can prevent the disease from spreading and ultimately save lives."}}
{"Q": "Matthew wanted to got trick or treating with his friend Micah. Which event could cause Jack and Matthew collected lots of candy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Micah had to stay at home sick. (B) Micah had a huge bag to collect candy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Micah had a huge bag to collect candy.\nExplanation: If Micah had a huge bag to collect candy, it is more likely that they would collect lots of candy as they would have more space to store it. If Micah had to stay at home sick, they would not be able to go trick or treating together and if Micah did not have a bag, they would have limited space to collect candy."}}
{"Q": "Jon got a job in East Texas. Which event could cause He decided to quit the job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jon didn't like his mom. (B) It was a hour away from his house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It was an hour away from his house.\nExplanation: The distance between Jon's house and his workplace could be a significant factor in his decision to quit the job. If the commute is too long or difficult, it could affect his work-life balance and overall job satisfaction. Therefore, it is more plausible that the distance was the reason for Jon's decision to quit rather than his relationship with his mother."}}
{"Q": "A farmer built a fence to keep in his horses. Which event could cause The farmer cursed and realized his fence was too short?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The farmers horses all escape the fence. (B) No horses can escape the fence.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the farmer's horses all escape the fence, it would be a clear indication that the fence is too short and not effective in keeping the horses in. This would likely cause the farmer to curse and realize the mistake in his fence-building. On the other hand, if no horses can escape the fence, the farmer would have no reason to curse or realize the fence is too short."}}
{"Q": "Nancy is in her forties and decided to go get her college degree. Which event could cause Nancy was surprised by how much things have change in schools?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At her new university, all courses required online participation. (B) Nancy is much younger than most students in her classes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: With the advancement of technology, it is plausible that online participation is now required in most courses. It is also common for universities to have a diverse student population, so it is not surprising for Nancy to be older than most of her classmates. However, the requirement of online participation may be a significant change for someone who has not been in school for a while."}}
{"Q": "Mike had a lemon tree in his backyard. Which event could cause He soon realized that he had forgotten to put any sugar in it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike made some lemonade with added sugar and took a big drink. (B) Mike made some lemonade and took a big drink.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Option (B) is more plausible because it mentions that Mike made lemonade without adding sugar, which is a mistake that can happen while making lemonade. Option (A) does not mention anything about forgetting to add sugar, so it is not a likely cause for Mike's realization."}}
{"Q": "I took my sons to their first concert. Which event could cause My sons decided they would rather go out and sit on the lawn?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I bought them seats in the front row. (B) My sons fell asleep.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the sons would prefer to sit on the lawn if they were uncomfortable or overwhelmed by being in the front row, rather than falling asleep during the concert. Additionally, if the concert was loud or crowded, the sons may have preferred a more relaxed atmosphere on the lawn."}}
{"Q": "Jim wants to see an action movie but Jen wants to see a romantic one. Which event could cause Jen was so happy that she went to see Jim's movie the next night?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim agreed to see the romantic movie with Jen. (B) Jen agreed to see the romantic movie with Jim.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Jim agreed to see the romantic movie with Jen, it would show that he is willing to compromise and consider her preferences. This would make Jen happy and more likely to reciprocate by agreeing to see Jim's preferred movie the next night. On the other hand, if Jen agreed to see the romantic movie with Jim, it wouldn't necessarily lead to her being happy enough to see his movie the next night, as she may still feel like her preferences were not fully considered."}}
{"Q": "Tito went surfing one morning in Hawaii. Which event could cause He hit his head on a coral and died?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A big wave knocked Tito off his surfboard. (B) Tito saw the conditions were dangerous.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: A big wave knocking Tito off his surfboard could cause him to hit his head on a coral and die. This is a more plausible answer than Tito seeing the conditions were dangerous because even experienced surfers can misjudge the power of a wave and get knocked off their board. Additionally, hitting coral is a common danger for surfers in Hawaii, and it can be fatal if the impact is severe enough."}}
{"Q": "Larry has decided to help out his friends prepare for a party. Which event could cause Larry decided to stay home from the party?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Larry caught the flu right after the party. (B) Larry caught the flu just before the party started.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Larry would stay home from the party if he caught the flu just before the party started, as he would not want to risk spreading the illness to his friends. If he caught the flu right after the party, it is unlikely that he would have stayed home from the party as he would have already attended."}}
{"Q": "Mimi and Alice had a favorite hangout spot. Which event could cause Now all they had of their favorite spot were the memories they create?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) the spot get ruined. (B) Mimi and Alice's favorite spot was preserved as a historical location.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the spot gets ruined, it would no longer be a suitable place for Mimi and Alice to hang out, and they would have to find a new spot. This would leave them with only memories of their old spot. On the other hand, if the spot was preserved as a historical location, it would still be accessible to them and they could continue to visit it, creating new memories. However, it is more likely that the spot would get ruined over time due to natural causes or human intervention, making option A the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sarah wanted to mail a card. Which event could cause Sarah's letter was soon heading to its destination?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She put stamps on it. (B) Sarah walked to the mailbox down the road.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She put stamps on it.\nExplanation: Putting stamps on the envelope is necessary for the letter to be processed and delivered by the postal service. Walking to the mailbox down the road is also important, but it is not the only factor that determines whether the letter will reach its destination. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lisa went for her routine bike ride. Which event could cause Some days turn out to be great adventures?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa spotted a cat and followed it off trail. (B) Lisa saw a lot of great food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Following a cat off trail could lead Lisa to new and exciting places she may not have discovered otherwise, potentially turning her routine bike ride into a great adventure. Seeing a lot of great food may be enjoyable, but it is unlikely to cause a great adventure on a bike ride."}}
{"Q": "Andrea's dad asked her to get firewood. Which event could cause Then, she brought them inside?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Andrea picked up as much wood as she could. (B) Andrea went and found fireflies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Andrea picked up as much wood as she could.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the task her dad asked her to do, which was to get firewood. It makes sense that after picking up the firewood, Andrea would bring it inside to use for a fire. On the other hand, finding fireflies does not have any connection to getting firewood and bringing it inside."}}
{"Q": "Jack had been working super hard for weeks. Which event could cause He got the promotion?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack's boss noticed how hard he ate his food. (B) Jack got called into his boss's office.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jack got called into his boss's office.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Jack's hard work was noticed by his boss and he was called into the office to discuss a promotion. Eating food has no correlation with job performance and would not be a factor in getting a promotion."}}
{"Q": "Gina was in the middle of the backseat surrounded by siblings. Which event could cause Gina was disgusted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina's sister got car sick and threw up. (B) Gina's siblings started picking their noses.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gina would be disgusted if her sister got car sick and threw up, as this is a common reaction to seeing or smelling vomit. Picking noses may be gross, but it is less likely to cause a strong physical reaction like disgust."}}
{"Q": "Sara was walking home from her college class. Which event could cause By the time she got back, it was time to go to school again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sara decided to skip school. (B) Campus construction forced Sara to take a long detour.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Campus construction forced Sara to take a long detour.\nExplanation: If Sara had to take a long detour due to campus construction, it could have delayed her arrival time and caused her to get back home later than expected. This would make it plausible for her to have to go back to school again soon after arriving home. On the other hand, if Sara decided to skip school, it would not make sense for her to go back to school again so soon."}}
{"Q": "The mayor wanted the town to decide how to use the warehouse. Which event could cause The next year he quit his day job and went on the road?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The town was incredibly well ran. (B) Nobody listened to him despite his great ideas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Nobody listened to him despite his great ideas.\nExplanation: If the mayor's ideas were not being heard or implemented, he may have become frustrated and decided to leave his day job and pursue other opportunities. This event is more plausible than the town being well ran, as it does not necessarily have a direct correlation with the mayor's decision to quit his job."}}
{"Q": "Jim ordered a new tablet off of the internet on black friday. Which event could cause They shipped him a new tablet because the other was lost in transit?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He received his tablet the next day. (B) Jim did not receive it and filed a complaint.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Jim did not receive the tablet, it is more plausible that he would file a complaint and the company would investigate and find that the tablet was lost in transit. This would result in them shipping him a new tablet to replace the lost one. It is less likely that he would receive the tablet the next day and then have it replaced due to it being lost in transit."}}
{"Q": "Sally really loves to play soccer. Which event could cause She won her first game by scoring the winning goal?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sally practiced playing soccer everyday. (B) Sally was cut from the team.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Sally practiced playing soccer everyday.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sally's hard work and dedication to practicing soccer everyday paid off in her first game by scoring the winning goal. Being cut from the team would not lead to winning a game and scoring the winning goal."}}
{"Q": "Lisa told everyone she was a great cook. Which event could cause Her friends were shocked when it was boxed macaroni and cheese?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lisa does not like to cook prepackaged foods. (B) Lisa, brought the dish out and served everyone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Lisa brought out boxed macaroni and cheese and served it to her friends, it would be a plausible event that could cause her friends to be shocked and question her claim of being a great cook. This is because boxed macaroni and cheese is a simple and easy dish to make, and it does not require much cooking skill. If Lisa had claimed to be a great cook, her friends would have expected her to make a more complex and impressive dish."}}
{"Q": "May hated doing dishes. Which event could cause May was so relieved that her dishes were all done now?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) May did all of her dishes. (B) May decided to buy paper plates.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. May did all of her dishes.\nExplanation: Since May hated doing dishes, it is more plausible that she would feel relieved after completing the task rather than avoiding it altogether by buying paper plates. Therefore, option A is the more likely event that would cause May to feel relieved."}}
{"Q": "I was painting my nails yesterday when I needed remover. Which event could cause I had to open the window to get the smell out?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I almost spilled remover all over the floor. (B) I was getting lightheaded looking for it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The strong smell of nail polish remover can cause dizziness and lightheadedness, so it is more plausible that the person opened the window to get some fresh air while looking for the remover. Almost spilling the remover would not necessarily require opening a window for ventilation."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy was washing his car. Which event could cause Dirt particles from the cloth had rubbed against his car's paint job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was very careful with the wash. (B) His child ran up and threw mud balls at him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that dirt particles from the cloth rubbed against the car's paint job due to the child throwing mud balls at Jimmy while he was washing the car. This is because mud balls would contain dirt and other debris that could easily transfer onto the car's surface when thrown. It is less likely that Jimmy being careful with the wash would cause dirt particles to rub against the car's paint job."}}
{"Q": "Maggie noticed a bat was flying around her ceiling. Which event could cause It was the bat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a screeching sound from below. (B) There was a screeching sound from above.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Bats are known to use echolocation to navigate and locate prey. They emit high-pitched sounds that bounce off objects and return to their ears, allowing them to create a mental map of their surroundings. Therefore, a screeching sound from above could indicate that the bat was using echolocation to navigate around the ceiling. A screeching sound from below would not be as likely to cause the bat to fly around the ceiling."}}
{"Q": "Yesterday I went to Macy's. Which event could cause Luckily I was able to return it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I bought a dress in the smallest size that still fit!. (B) The sweater I purchased was too small.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the dress was the smallest size that still fit, it is unlikely that the customer would need to return it. However, if the sweater was too small, it would make sense for the customer to return it and luckily be able to do so."}}
{"Q": "Nina brushed her beautiful brown hair. Which event could cause She forced herself to be more gentle?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nina saw a lot of hair in her brush. (B) Nina noticed she was pulling extra amounts of wax from he scalp.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Nina saw a lot of hair in her brush, it would be a sign that she was being too rough with her hair and causing it to break or fall out. This would likely prompt her to be more gentle in the future to prevent further damage. Pulling extra amounts of wax from her scalp would not necessarily be related to her brushing technique and would not likely cause her to be more gentle."}}
{"Q": "Sally mom told her they didn't have money to pay the light bill. Which event could cause Her mom paid the light bill?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) sally reminded her mom had some money in the savings account. (B) Sally's mom gave her money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sally reminded her mom about the savings account because it suggests that the family has some financial resources available. It is less likely that Sally's mom would suddenly have money to pay the bill without any explanation or source of income."}}
{"Q": "Michael was playing a video game. Which event could cause He was banned from the game?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Michael left nasty comments on the school forum. (B) Michael began harassing a female player in the game.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Michael began harassing a female player in the game.\nExplanation: Harassment is a serious offense in online gaming communities and can result in a ban. Leaving nasty comments on a school forum may not be directly related to the video game and may not warrant a ban from the game. However, harassing another player in the game is a violation of the game's terms of service and can result in a ban. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jack stole a small boy's bike. Which event could cause Jack returned the bike, and hasn't stolen any since?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) As Jack ran away on foot he was hit by a passing car and soiled himself. (B) Jacks mom found out and punished him and made him apologize.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jack's mom finding out and punishing him would lead to him returning the bike and not stealing any since, as it involves a consequence for his actions and a lesson learned. Option A, while unfortunate, does not necessarily have a direct correlation to Jack's behavior towards stealing."}}
{"Q": "Gina had a friend named Ruth who lived across the street. Which event could cause Gina was shocked since she had no idea Ruth had been stealing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ruth found out Gina got arrested for theft. (B) The cops showed up to raid Ruth's house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The cops showed up to raid Ruth's house.\nExplanation: This event would be more plausible as it directly involves Ruth and her actions. If Ruth was stealing, it is possible that the police would eventually catch on and raid her house. On the other hand, if Gina got arrested for theft, it would not necessarily mean that Ruth was involved or that Gina knew about Ruth's actions."}}
{"Q": "James was a fire chief who wanted to retire to Florida. Which event could cause The kitchen is always crowded when James makes his Eggplant Parmesan?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) James remaining to make Eggplant Parmesan. (B) After James retired he became a chef.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it directly relates to James making Eggplant Parmesan. Option B is not related to James making Eggplant Parmesan and does not explain why the kitchen is always crowded when he makes it."}}
{"Q": "Lucy rented a movie to watch at home. Which event could cause Lucy sat with tears running down her face as the credits played?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy watched the movie, though it was thrilling. (B) The move had a sad ending.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that the movie had a sad ending, which caused Lucy to cry. This is a common emotional response to sad movies, and the fact that Lucy is crying during the credits suggests that the ending had a significant impact on her. Choice A, that the movie was thrilling, does not necessarily explain why Lucy is crying, as excitement and tears are not typically associated."}}
{"Q": "Chad bought a new car. Which event could cause Chad was reduced to taking the bus and walking once again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) chat got in a car accident. (B) Chad saw a car accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Chad got in a car accident, his car could be damaged beyond repair or require expensive repairs that he cannot afford, forcing him to take the bus or walk again. On the other hand, seeing a car accident would not necessarily affect Chad's ability to drive his own car."}}
{"Q": "Samantha was drenched in sweat. Which event could cause Samantha was glad that it was just a dream?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She woke up laughing. (B) Samantha had a nightmare.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Samantha had a nightmare.\nExplanation: If Samantha was drenched in sweat, it is more likely that she had a nightmare that caused her to feel scared or anxious, rather than waking up laughing. The physical reaction of sweating suggests a more intense emotional response, which is more commonly associated with a nightmare. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was looking for a flower for his girlfriend today. Which event could cause Tom walked out of the store with the pretty flower in hand?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom looked around a long time for a flower. (B) Tom went to an online flower store.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom looked around a long time for a flower.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that Tom physically went to a store to look for a flower, indicating that he was actively searching for the perfect one. Option B suggests that Tom ordered the flower online, which would not result in him walking out of a physical store with the flower in hand."}}
{"Q": "Chase had a loose tooth. Which event could cause When his tooth came out he was relieved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Chase was in a good place. (B) Chase jumped on the tramp and his tooth fell out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Chase jumped on the tramp and his tooth fell out.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Chase's tooth fell out due to physical activity, such as jumping on a trampoline, rather than being in a good place. Additionally, the feeling of relief is commonly associated with the discomfort of a loose tooth finally coming out."}}
{"Q": "Steve saw some sushi in the fridge. Which event could cause His roommate was fine with it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Steve ate it and it turned out to be his roommates. (B) It belonged to Steve's roommate. He said if he take him the sushi to night Steve will receive him out for sushi tomorrow.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it suggests that the sushi belonged to Steve's roommate and he had given permission for Steve to take it. Additionally, the roommate's offer to take Steve out for sushi tomorrow implies that he was not upset about Steve taking the sushi. Option A suggests that Steve ate his roommate's sushi without permission, which is less likely to result in his roommate being fine with it."}}
{"Q": "Shirley was pregnant and had just gone into labor. Which event could cause Before she could wrap her head around it, her baby was born?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Shirley barely experienced pain. (B) Shirley was excited she was going to become a mom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Shirley barely experienced pain.\nExplanation: While it is possible for some women to have a relatively painless labor, it is more common for labor to be accompanied by significant pain and discomfort. Therefore, it is more plausible that Shirley experienced minimal pain during labor, allowing her to be caught off guard by the sudden arrival of her baby."}}
{"Q": "Beth broke her leg. Which event could cause Now it stinks very bad?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Beth's leg was stuck in a cast for several ending. (B) Beth had a cast on for weeks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Beth had a cast on for weeks.\nExplanation: If Beth had a cast on for weeks, it is possible that she was not able to properly clean the area around her leg, leading to a buildup of bacteria and a bad smell. On the other hand, if her leg was stuck in a cast for several hours or a day, it is less likely that it would cause a strong odor."}}
{"Q": "There was a rumble in the park. Which event could cause Just then the police showed up?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Noone called the police. (B) Gunshots went off loudly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Gunshots went off loudly.\nExplanation: Gunshots going off loudly is a more plausible event that could cause a rumble in the park and prompt someone to call the police. It is also a serious enough situation that would require police intervention. It is unlikely that the police would show up without any reason, so option (A) is less likely."}}
{"Q": "Jon wanted to know more about birds, so he went to the library. Which event could cause Jon ran out of the library and never went there again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jon's peers made fun of the book he chose. (B) Jon saw a bird that flew inside the library book.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jon's peers making fun of the book he chose would cause him to feel embarrassed and not want to return to the library. Seeing a bird fly inside the library book is unlikely and would not necessarily cause Jon to never return to the library again."}}
{"Q": "Joey accidentally drove his truck off the road Christmas morning. Which event could cause Joey made it home in time for Christmas dinner?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joey happened to have AAA. (B) Joey was stranded for more than five minutes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Joey happened to have AAA.\nExplanation: If Joey had AAA, he could have called for assistance and had his truck towed back onto the road or to a nearby mechanic. This would have allowed him to make it home in time for Christmas dinner. On the other hand, if Joey was stranded for more than five minutes, it is unlikely that he would have been able to make it home in time for dinner, as he would have needed to wait for help to arrive or find another means of transportation."}}
{"Q": "Brenda went on a vacation to Vegas. Which event could cause She left Vegas knowing she had a good time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Brenda forgot to go dance and gamble. (B) She danced and gambled the whole time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She danced and gambled the whole time.\nExplanation: If Brenda spent the whole time dancing and gambling, it is more likely that she had a good time and enjoyed herself. Forgetting to do these activities would not necessarily indicate a bad time, but actively participating in them would suggest a more enjoyable experience."}}
{"Q": "Beth had to choose between universities. Which event could cause Beth decided to stay at home and go to school close by?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Beth didn't want to be away from her family and friends. (B) Beth did not want to pay for student housing, so decided to squat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Beth didn't want to be away from her family and friends.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because many students choose to attend universities close to home to be near their support system. Being away from family and friends can be difficult for some students, especially if they are used to being close to them. On the other hand, squatting is illegal and not a viable option for most students."}}
{"Q": "Lia was starting high school at a new school. Which event could cause Lia made many friends on her first day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lia talked to many new teachers. (B) Lia was an outgoing person, so she quickly introduced herself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Lia being an outgoing person and introducing herself quickly is a more plausible event that could cause her to make many friends on her first day. Talking to many new teachers may not necessarily lead to making friends with other students."}}
{"Q": "Jack works at an auto body shop. Which event could cause They're afraid to give the owner the bill?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jack crashed an expensive car. (B) Jack had to get the car lift repaired it was very expensive.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Jack crashed an expensive car, it is likely that the repair bill would be very high and the owner may be upset or angry about the cost. This could make Jack and his colleagues afraid to give the owner the bill. On the other hand, if Jack had to get the car lift repaired, while it may be expensive, it is a routine maintenance issue and not likely to cause fear in giving the owner the bill."}}
{"Q": "Four Outlaws camped in Blood Gulch. Which event could cause He let them go free?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The guard cheked them to see what they were wearing. (B) The sheriff bribed the outlaws with his ill-gotten gains.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the guard checked the outlaws to see what they were wearing and found that they were not the ones responsible for the recent crimes in the area. This would give the outlaws an alibi and reason to be let go free. It is less likely that the sheriff would bribe the outlaws with his own ill-gotten gains, as this would be a risky move and could potentially lead to his own arrest."}}
{"Q": "Eli was a fan of the Walking Dead and all his friends knew it. Which event could cause Eli was sentenced to life in prison for his reckless behavior?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eli tried to watch the show in real life. (B) Eli attacked one of his friends, laughing and proclaiming she was a zombie.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Eli attacked one of his friends, laughing and proclaiming she was a zombie.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible as it involves Eli's reckless behavior and potential harm to others. Attempting to watch the show in real life may be dangerous, but it is unlikely to result in a life sentence. However, attacking someone and claiming they are a zombie could result in serious injury or even death, leading to a harsh punishment."}}
{"Q": "Jan and Kim were both using the Montessori education model. Which event could cause Jan threw away the books?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Montessori model does not focus on textbooks. (B) The Montessori model does not work without textbooks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The Montessori education model emphasizes hands-on learning and exploration, rather than relying solely on textbooks. Therefore, it is more plausible that Jan threw away the books because she realized they were not necessary for the Montessori approach, rather than because she believed the model could not work without them."}}
{"Q": "Ashley had been working hard at work. Which event could cause She happily accepted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ashley was offered a demotion. (B) Ashley was ask if she wants a promotion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Ashley was asked if she wants a promotion.\nExplanation: Ashley had been working hard at work, so it is more plausible that she would happily accept a promotion rather than a demotion. A promotion would be a recognition of her hard work and a step forward in her career, which would make her happy. On the other hand, a demotion would be a setback and a disappointment, which would not make her happy. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely event that would cause Ashley to happily accept."}}
{"Q": "Tommy was scared of skating. Which event could cause He always loved skating after that?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His big brother spent a week teaching him to skate. (B) Tommy realized that he was really good at eating.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Tommy's big brother spent a week teaching him to skate, it would give him the opportunity to learn and practice in a safe and supportive environment. With his brother's guidance and encouragement, Tommy may gain confidence and overcome his fear of skating. On the other hand, realizing that he was good at eating has nothing to do with skating and would not likely change his attitude towards it."}}
{"Q": "Jane wanted to wear a shirt. Which event could cause She returned it and apologized?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) she bought a scarf that was the wrong size. (B) Jane realized the shirt was too small.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jane realized the shirt was too small.\nExplanation: If Jane realized the shirt was too small, she would have to return it and apologize for the inconvenience. This is a more plausible answer than buying a scarf that was the wrong size, as that would not necessarily require her to return the shirt or apologize."}}
{"Q": "Dan took his daughter to the beach. Which event could cause They came back the next day and built one again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan and his daughter built a huge sandcastle right after a wave came in and washed it away. (B) Dan and his daughter built a sandcastle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it explains why Dan and his daughter would come back the next day to build another sandcastle. They were likely disappointed when the wave washed away their first sandcastle, so they decided to try again the next day. Option B does not provide a reason for why they would come back and build another sandcastle."}}
{"Q": "While walking his pet lizard, he didn't think he was breaking the law. Which event could cause He gave the lizard's owner a ticket?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Having a lizard is illegal in that town. (B) A police officer said hi to the lizard owner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If having a lizard is illegal in that town, then the lizard owner would be breaking the law by walking the pet lizard, and the police officer could give them a ticket for it. Option B is not a plausible answer as simply saying hi to someone would not result in a ticket being issued."}}
{"Q": "I was invited to a party from a somewhat friend. Which event could cause First party that I wanted to be over fast?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was very boring. (B) All of his friends were nice and I felt comfortable.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It was very boring.\nExplanation: If the party was very boring, it would make sense for the person to want it to be over fast. They may not be having a good time and would rather leave and do something else. On the other hand, if they felt comfortable with all of the friend's friends, they would likely want to stay longer and enjoy the company."}}
{"Q": "I played an April Fools joke on my friend in 2007. Which event could cause She was very excited until she found out it was a trick?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I told her I was getting her an cheap gift. (B) I maid her think she won the lottery.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I made her think she won the lottery.\nExplanation: Winning the lottery is a big deal and can cause a lot of excitement. If the friend believed she had won and then found out it was just a joke, it would likely cause disappointment and frustration. On the other hand, receiving a cheap gift may not have elicited as much excitement to begin with, so the letdown would not have been as significant."}}
{"Q": "Reggie and Ally were laying on the ground looking up at the sky. Which event could cause To her Reggie's dinosaur looked like a bunny?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were looking at clouds shape. (B) Reggie and Ally were looking for shapes in the clouds. Ally said one cloud looked like a dinosaur. Reggie disagreed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Reggie and Ally were looking at cloud shapes, it is possible that Reggie's dinosaur looked like a bunny due to the way the clouds were formed. However, if they were specifically looking for shapes in the clouds and Ally pointed out a dinosaur while Reggie disagreed, it is less likely that Reggie would suddenly see a bunny instead. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Dana loved his gold chain. Which event could cause He sold his $200 gold chain for $20 to a passerby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dana, lost his wallet and needed money. (B) Dana got into debt very badly and needed $200.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Dana lost his wallet and needed money, rather than getting into debt badly and needing exactly $200. Losing a wallet is a common occurrence and can cause someone to need quick cash, while getting into debt is a more complex situation that may require more than just selling a gold chain."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was watching a huge lightning storm. Which event could cause Luckily they were able to put it out easily?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A bolt of lightning hit the tv antennae. (B) Lightning struck and started a small fire.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Lightning struck and started a small fire.\nExplanation: While it is possible for a bolt of lightning to hit a TV antennae, it is less likely to cause a fire that can be easily put out. On the other hand, lightning striking and starting a small fire is a common occurrence during thunderstorms and can be quickly extinguished with proper equipment."}}
{"Q": "Every morning I wake up to the bird's crow. Which event could cause I know it's morning when I hear the bird's crow?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I saw the bird's feathers. (B) I no longer turn on my alarm clock.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the person no longer turns on their alarm clock, it suggests that they have been waking up consistently at the same time every morning. The bird's crow serves as a confirmation that it is indeed morning and time to start the day. Seeing the bird's feathers (choice A) does not necessarily have any correlation to knowing it's morning."}}
{"Q": "Lars had always wanted to try photography. Which event could cause Lars hated photography?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lars finally tried photography and was terrible. (B) Lars quickly discovered that photography was easier and more exciting than he had anticipated.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Lars tried photography and was terrible at it, it could cause him to hate it. Failing at something can be discouraging and make someone lose interest in it. On the other hand, if Lars found photography to be easier and more exciting than he had anticipated, it is unlikely that he would hate it."}}
{"Q": "Yesterday was Lauren's Birthday. Which event could cause She loved the cake and ate 2 pieces after blowing out the candles?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I made her a pie. (B) Lauren was excited to see a cake with candles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The fact that Lauren was excited to see a cake with candles suggests that she was looking forward to having cake for her birthday. Additionally, the fact that she ate 2 pieces after blowing out the candles indicates that she enjoyed the cake. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Nita was playing rummy with her dad. Which event could cause Nita hated playing rummy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nita lost as she always does. (B) Nita just crushed it as she always does of course.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Nita always loses at rummy, it is likely that she would not enjoy playing the game. Losing repeatedly can be frustrating and demotivating, leading to a dislike for the activity. On the other hand, if Nita always wins, she would likely enjoy playing the game and look forward to it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Michelle had a big test on Friday. Which event could cause They both laughed for a while and crammed extra hard?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Michelle studied with her friend. (B) Michelle did not study.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Michelle studied with her friend.\nExplanation: If Michelle studied with her friend, it is possible that they both found the material difficult or challenging, which could have led to them laughing and cramming extra hard. Additionally, studying with a friend can often be more motivating and productive than studying alone, which could have also contributed to their extra effort. On the other hand, if Michelle did not study at all, it is unlikely that she would have been laughing and cramming extra hard, as she would have been unprepared for the test."}}
{"Q": "Linda went to buy some frozen yogurt. Which event could cause Linda was very pleased?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The store had Linda's favorite brands at a new higher price. (B) The store had Linda's favorite brands at a new lower price.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Linda would be more pleased if the store had her favorite brands at a new lower price because she would be able to save money while still getting her favorite frozen yogurt. If the store had her favorite brands at a new higher price, she would likely be disappointed or frustrated."}}
{"Q": "Rena had a tattoo she didn't like. Which event could cause One hour later,the new cover up tattoo was finished over the old one?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rena went to the tattoo parlor to get another one. (B) She decided to get a cover up tatoo.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She decided to get a cover up tattoo.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rena decided to get a cover up tattoo to hide the old one she didn't like, rather than going to a tattoo parlor to get another tattoo completely unrelated to the old one."}}
{"Q": "Miss Susie was counting the kids in her class getting on the bus. Which event could cause The kids and Miss Susie got on the bus to go back to school?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were coming back from a field trip. (B) Miss Susie counted all the chickens.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They were coming back from a field trip.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Miss Susie and the kids were getting on the bus to go back to school after a field trip, rather than Miss Susie counting chickens. Counting chickens does not seem like a reason to get on a bus to go back to school."}}
{"Q": "A florist began to make a bouquet of red roses. Which event could cause The bouquet was sold to a customer moments later?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The florist put the bouquet in overnight storage. (B) She placed the bouquet in her front display case.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She placed the bouquet in her front display case.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the bouquet was sold to a customer moments later if it was placed in the front display case, where customers can easily see and purchase it. If the florist put the bouquet in overnight storage, it is unlikely that it would be sold moments later."}}
{"Q": "Randall wants to play with other kids in his class. Which event could cause Randall gladly shared his toy with his new friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A boy from his class came over and asked him play, but he said no. (B) The kids saw his toy and wanted to play.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The kids saw his toy and wanted to play.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Randall would gladly share his toy with his new friends if they showed interest in playing with it. If a boy from his class asked him to play but he said no, it may indicate that Randall is not interested in playing with others or sharing his toys."}}
{"Q": "George's stomach growled. Which event could cause Grinning, he mixed them together and enjoyed a bowl of tomato soup?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He grabbed some crackers from the table nearby and found a can of soup. (B) George made some Chinese food for dinner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it directly addresses George's hunger and provides a solution for it by stating that he found a can of soup and crackers nearby, which he mixed together to make a meal. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not address George's hunger or explain how he satisfied it with tomato soup."}}
{"Q": "June liked to practice yoga often. Which event could cause June practiced her yoga at the park in a secluded spot?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) June liked to do yoga late at night. (B) June liked to practice yoga outside at lunch.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) June liked to practice yoga outside at lunch.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that June wanted to practice yoga outside during the day, which is a common time for people to exercise. Additionally, practicing yoga at lunchtime could be a way for June to break up her workday and get some fresh air. On the other hand, practicing yoga late at night (option A) may not be as safe or practical, and it is less likely that June would choose to do so in a public park."}}
{"Q": "May was a big fan of the singing group Pentatonix. Which event could cause Later that month May went to see and meet the band members?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) May won a radio contest to meet the band. (B) May bought counterfeit tickets online.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. May won a radio contest to meet the band.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that May won a radio contest to meet the band rather than buying counterfeit tickets online. Winning a radio contest is a legitimate way to meet a band, while buying counterfeit tickets online is illegal and risky. Additionally, the fact that May is a big fan of the group suggests that she would be more likely to enter a contest to meet them rather than risking buying fake tickets."}}
{"Q": "Jon was driving to work. Which event could cause Jon turned around and drove home to change into clean clothes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jon spilled coffee on himself. (B) Jon realized he had put on a dirt, smelly shoe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Spilling coffee on oneself is a common occurrence and can be embarrassing to go to work with a stain on clothing. It is also a quick fix to go home and change into clean clothes. On the other hand, realizing one has put on a dirty and smelly shoe may not be as urgent of a reason to turn around and go home to change."}}
{"Q": "Peter and Kevin grew up in a small town. Which event could cause Their sons are the best of friends, and play on the same team?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Peter and Kevin's daughters like the same sports. (B) Peter and Kevin had kids.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Peter and Kevin having kids would lead to their sons becoming friends and playing on the same team, rather than their daughters liking the same sports. Gender does not necessarily determine friendship, but growing up in the same town and having parents who are friends could lead to their children becoming friends as well."}}
{"Q": "Jeff lived in an apartment. Which event could cause Jeff moved out of his apartment?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jeff decided to buy a hot tub. (B) Jeff wanted a place with a big yard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Jeff wanted a place with a big yard.\nExplanation: Since Jeff lived in an apartment, it is unlikely that he would be able to have a big yard. If having a big yard was important to Jeff, he would need to move to a house or a different apartment complex that offered outdoor space. On the other hand, buying a hot tub is not necessarily a reason to move out of an apartment, as it can be installed in many apartments with balconies or outdoor spaces. Therefore, option B is a more plausible reason for Jeff to move out of his apartment."}}
{"Q": "Allison was entered to be in a competitive eating contest. Which event could cause Allison did not do well in the contest and didn't win?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Allison tried really hard to eat all the hotdogs. (B) Allison had frequently done things like this before.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Even if Allison tried really hard to eat all the hotdogs, it doesn't necessarily mean she would do well in the contest. Competitive eating requires a specific set of skills and techniques, and even experienced eaters can struggle in certain events. Therefore, it is more plausible that Allison didn't do well in the contest because she wasn't skilled enough or didn't have the right strategy, rather than simply not trying hard enough."}}
{"Q": "Sally wanted to give her Mom something special for her birthday. Which event could cause Sally made a pretty pink necklace out of beads for her Mom's birthday?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she went shopping and found a nice jewelry craft set. (B) Sally had already bought her a gift.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it explains how Sally got the materials to make the necklace. Option B does not provide any explanation for how Sally made the necklace."}}
{"Q": "Jeremy's mother didn't approve of his lifestyle. Which event could cause Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jeremy got a job and moved out. (B) Jeremy got a job and moved in.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Jeremy got a job and moved out, he would have to take on more responsibility for his own life and living expenses. This could lead to him enjoying being more responsible and potentially changing his lifestyle to better align with his mother's expectations. On the other hand, if he simply got a job and moved in with his mother, he may not feel the same level of responsibility and may continue with his current lifestyle."}}
{"Q": "Morgan enjoyed long walks on the beach. Which event could cause Her boyfriend was upset he didn't propose to her first?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) her boyfriend wants to marry her for sure. (B) Morgan's boyfriend didn't like the beach but her best friend Mike always went with her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Morgan's boyfriend wants to marry her for sure, he may feel upset that he didn't propose to her first during one of their long walks on the beach. This is a more plausible answer than (B) because Morgan's boyfriend not liking the beach and her best friend Mike going with her does not necessarily have a direct connection to him being upset about not proposing first."}}
{"Q": "The kids were at the beach. Which event could cause They loved jumping the waves?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kids loved waves. (B) The kids played in the water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The kids played in the water.\nExplanation: Since the sentence mentions that the kids were at the beach, it is more likely that they were playing in the water rather than just loving the waves. Additionally, the sentence specifically mentions jumping the waves, which is an activity that would require the kids to be playing in the water."}}
{"Q": "Rachel bought a goldfish for her child. Which event could cause Her child asked her why his fish lost so much weight?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The goldfish appeared to lose weight rapidly. (B) Her child did not feed the dog.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If the goldfish appeared to lose weight rapidly, it would be a more plausible reason for the child to ask why the fish lost weight. Neglecting to feed the dog would not have a direct impact on the weight of the goldfish."}}
{"Q": "I came home from work one day. Which event could cause I made a delicious stir fry and ate it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wanted to try something new with my leftovers. (B) I was hungry so I went into the kitchen and ordered something to eat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person made a delicious stir fry because they wanted to try something new with their leftovers. Option B suggests that the person ordered something to eat, which does not align with the fact that they made a stir fry."}}
{"Q": "Ted like to park as close to his office building as possible. Which event could cause Ted never saw the car parked in two spaces again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ted accidentally washed a car parked in two spaces. (B) Someone hit Ted's car.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Someone hit Ted's car.\nExplanation: If someone hit Ted's car while it was parked in two spaces, he may become more cautious and park in a single space to avoid any further damage. On the other hand, accidentally washing a car parked in two spaces would not necessarily change Ted's parking habits."}}
{"Q": "Thunder rumbled in the distance as the rain began to fall. Which event could cause The flash of lightning threw eerie shadows on the wall?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was trying to sleep. (B) I went outside to watch the storm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the flash of lightning would be seen if someone went outside to watch the storm rather than if they were trying to sleep indoors."}}
{"Q": "Erica was in a hurry in the morning. Which event could cause She arrived at work on time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Erica loved to be late to work. (B) Erica drove fast in her car.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Erica drove fast in her car.\nExplanation: If Erica was in a hurry in the morning, it is more plausible that she would try to make up for lost time by driving fast in her car rather than intentionally wanting to be late to work. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely event that could cause her to arrive at work on time."}}
{"Q": "Heather had four children. Which event could cause Heather was mortified when she stood and found her pants soaked?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) While holding one of them, she felt something dry in her lap. (B) Heather's kids played a prank on her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Heather may have experienced urinary incontinence, which caused her pants to become soaked. \nExplanation: Urinary incontinence is a common condition that affects many women, especially those who have given birth. It can cause unexpected leakage of urine, which can be embarrassing and uncomfortable. This scenario is more plausible than her children playing a prank on her, as it is a real medical condition that many women experience."}}
{"Q": "Erica has always liked to dress formally for any occasion. Which event could cause Erica wishes she hadn't always been so formal?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) her dresses were so expensive and casual. (B) Erica went to a party and was stared at. Everyone was casually dressed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Erica went to a party and was stared at because everyone was casually dressed, it would be a more plausible reason for her to regret always dressing formally. The cost of her dresses being casual (option A) is not a strong enough reason for her to regret her formal attire."}}
{"Q": "Kevin made Peruvian style chicken at a stall in New York City. Which event could cause Kevin was later given a health code violation and had to close shop?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kevin used different boards to cut chicken and onions. (B) Kevin used the same board to cut chicken and onions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Using the same board to cut chicken and onions is a violation of health code regulations as it can lead to cross-contamination and the spread of harmful bacteria. This is a more plausible reason for Kevin's health code violation and closure of his shop."}}
{"Q": "Ricky fell while hiking in the woods. Which event could cause Ricky was soaking wet from falling in the pond?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rick rolled into a pond. (B) Ricky fell into the grass below.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Rick rolled into a pond.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ricky fell into a pond and got soaking wet rather than falling into grass and getting wet. Falling into grass would not typically result in being soaking wet, whereas falling into a pond would."}}
{"Q": "Leila went on safari in Africa. Which event could cause Leila would remember the safari for many years to come?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Leila saw lions and elephants, and tried lots of terrible foods. (B) She so enjoyed the animals and living out of a tent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Seeing lions and elephants and trying terrible foods may be memorable, but enjoying the animals and living out of a tent would likely create a more lasting impression on Leila. The unique experience of being immersed in nature and living in a different way than she is used to would likely stick with her for many years to come."}}
{"Q": "James had a vision of a product to save lives. Which event could cause James went to market with the idea, anyway?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) James developed it with some positive feedback. (B) James couldn't find a way to make it cheap.", "R": {"text": "Answer: James developed it with some positive feedback.\nExplanation: If James received positive feedback on his product idea, it would give him the confidence and motivation to pursue it further and bring it to market. Positive feedback could come from potential customers, industry experts, or even friends and family who believe in James and his vision. On the other hand, if James couldn't find a way to make it cheap, it would be a major obstacle to bringing the product to market and could potentially discourage him from pursuing the idea further."}}
{"Q": "I was walking in the park. Which event could cause I had to throw away my shoes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wasn't careful and stepped in dog poop. (B) I stepped in a pile of mud and realized I had a hole in my shirt.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I wasn't careful and stepped in dog poop.\nExplanation: Stepping in dog poop is a common occurrence in parks, especially if owners do not clean up after their pets. It is also a more likely reason to throw away shoes as the smell and bacteria can be difficult to remove. Stepping in mud and having a hole in a shirt may be inconvenient, but it is unlikely to warrant throwing away shoes."}}
{"Q": "Karl bought a new rug. Which event could cause When he got a new one he didn't let the dog near it for a while?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Karl was afraid his dog would steal the rug. (B) Karl's dog immediately urinated on it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Karl's dog immediately urinated on it.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Karl didn't let his dog near the new rug because he was worried that the dog might urinate on it, especially if the dog has a history of doing so. This is a common concern for pet owners when introducing new items into their home. On the other hand, it is less likely that Karl was afraid his dog would steal the rug, as dogs are not known for stealing household items like rugs."}}
{"Q": "Remy was always good at playing soccer. Which event could cause Remy was surprised when they both were awarded the scholarship?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her sister was even better than Remy. (B) Remy had a rival who played as well as she.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Her sister was even better than Remy.\nExplanation: If Remy's sister was better than her at soccer, it would be surprising for both of them to be awarded a scholarship. This would be unexpected and could cause Remy to be surprised. On the other hand, if Remy had a rival who played as well as she did, it would not be as surprising for both of them to be awarded a scholarship since they were both equally skilled."}}
{"Q": "Ryan wanted to treat his friends. Which event could cause Everyone liked it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ryan invited his closest friends to the restaurant and treated them to lunch. (B) Ryan took them to his favorite restaurant for dinner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Inviting his closest friends to the restaurant and treating them to lunch is a more plausible answer as it shows that Ryan is being generous and thoughtful towards his friends. Lunch is also a more casual and relaxed meal, which allows for more conversation and bonding time among friends. Additionally, by inviting his closest friends, Ryan is more likely to choose a restaurant that everyone will enjoy, leading to a higher likelihood of everyone liking it."}}
{"Q": "Billy decided to collect insects. Which event could cause Billy decided that he enjoyed his new hobby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Billy found a lot of bugs. (B) she is the best.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Finding a lot of bugs would likely make Billy feel successful and excited about his new hobby, leading him to enjoy it more. It would give him a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue collecting insects. On the other hand, option B is unrelated and does not provide a logical reason for Billy to enjoy collecting insects."}}
{"Q": "Leah loved fireflies. Which event could cause So, she admired the fireflies from her window instead?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Leah couldn't watch the fireflies outside. (B) She wanted one as a pet, and thought that would be fun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Leah couldn't watch the fireflies outside.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it suggests that there was some obstacle preventing Leah from watching the fireflies outside, such as bad weather or being too late at night. It also makes sense that Leah would still want to admire the fireflies, even if she couldn't be outside with them. Option B is less likely because fireflies are not typically kept as pets, and it would be difficult to catch and care for them."}}
{"Q": "Tim went on a date. Which event could cause Leslie loved the date?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim took Leslie on a romantic bear hunt. (B) Tim went to the movies with Leslie.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tim went to the movies with Leslie.\nExplanation: Going to the movies is a common and popular date activity that many people enjoy. It allows for conversation before and after the movie, and the shared experience of watching a film can create a sense of connection between two people. On the other hand, going on a romantic bear hunt is not a typical or safe date activity, making it an unlikely event that would cause Leslie to love the date."}}
{"Q": "Emma wanted to learn how to sew. Which event could cause Now Emma can make a full wardrobe?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Emma went for sewing lessons. (B) Emma took some clothes and was good at it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Emma went for sewing lessons.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Emma learned how to sew by taking sewing lessons rather than just being naturally good at it by taking some clothes. Sewing lessons would provide Emma with the necessary skills and knowledge to create a full wardrobe, while just being good at sewing a few clothes would not necessarily translate to being able to create a full wardrobe."}}
{"Q": "Bob decided to hike in the jungles of Indonesia. Which event could cause Bob had always been reckless?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob decided to turn back when he realized he wasn't properly equipped for the hike. (B) Bob forgot to bring a canteen and died of dehydration.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Bob forgetting to bring a canteen and dying of dehydration is a more plausible event that could happen if Bob had always been reckless. Forgetting such an essential item for a hike in the jungle shows a lack of preparation and care for his own safety. This behavior is consistent with someone who is reckless and takes unnecessary risks. Turning back when realizing he wasn't properly equipped, on the other hand, shows a level of responsibility and caution, which is not consistent with someone who is reckless."}}
{"Q": "Sam and his wife were busy packing for their trip. Which event could cause Sam wanted to get away from his wife as soon as possible?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam's wife flirted with other men on the trip. (B) She was getting angry because he already packed his suitcase the way she told him to.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sam would want to get away from his wife if she was getting angry with him for not following her instructions on packing, rather than her flirting with other men on the trip. Disagreements and arguments over packing can be stressful and frustrating, and may cause Sam to want to distance himself from the situation. Flirting, while potentially upsetting, may not necessarily cause Sam to want to immediately get away from his wife."}}
{"Q": "We were driving through the Blue Ridge Mountains in the early spring. Which event could cause The next morning, the ranger told us that a bear had been spotted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We kept driving nonstop until we arrived. (B) We had stopped and decided to camp at a rest area because we were tired from driving.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: If the travelers had stopped and camped at a rest area, they would have been in an area where bears are known to roam. This increases the likelihood of a bear sighting. Additionally, bears are more active in the spring as they come out of hibernation, so it is plausible that one would be spotted during this time. Driving nonstop would not necessarily increase the chances of a bear sighting."}}
{"Q": "Anna was making a world atlas. Which event could cause Then she colored in her atlas?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna drew her world cotton balls. (B) Anna drew her world atlas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Anna drew her world atlas.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anna would color in her world atlas after she had already drawn it, rather than coloring it in before she had even created it. Therefore, option B is the more likely event that would cause Anna to color in her atlas."}}
{"Q": "Leslie is my boss and she is very good at her job. Which event could cause I should listen to her more because she has promoted me twice?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Leslie treats me like she does not like me. (B) Leslie treats me with respect.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Leslie treats me with respect.\nExplanation: If Leslie treats the person with respect and has promoted them twice, it is likely that she values their work and has confidence in their abilities. Therefore, it would be wise to listen to her advice and guidance in order to continue to succeed in the workplace. On the other hand, if Leslie treats the person poorly, it may be more difficult to trust her judgment and advice."}}
{"Q": "Charlie had left his beloved stuffed monkey on the school bus. Which event could cause After carefully searching it, he found the lost monkey?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Charlie went back to search the bus. (B) Charlie look for a few minutes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Charlie went back to search the bus.\nExplanation: If Charlie had left his stuffed monkey on the school bus, the most plausible event that could lead to him finding it would be if he went back to search the bus. It is unlikely that he would find it by just looking for a few minutes without knowing where it was left. Therefore, option A is the most likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "My roommates put up their Christmas tree this year. Which event could cause This is what it's like living with a cat?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The roommates soon had to take the tree down. (B) The cat enjoyed the ornaments and garland and slept under the tree.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The cat enjoyed the ornaments and garland and slept under the tree.\nExplanation: Cats are known for their love of climbing and playing with objects, especially shiny and dangling ones like Christmas ornaments and garland. It is not uncommon for cats to be attracted to Christmas trees and enjoy playing with the decorations. Therefore, it is more plausible that the cat would enjoy the tree rather than causing the roommates to take it down."}}
{"Q": "Joe went to college for art. Which event could cause Joe hated pizza?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Because of his Italian heritage people called him \"Pizza Joe.\". (B) and hated art.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe's dislike of pizza is related to negative experiences or associations with the food, such as being teased or bullied for his Italian heritage and the stereotype of Italians loving pizza. It is less likely that his college major in art would have any direct correlation with his feelings towards pizza."}}
{"Q": "Jason woke up late one morning. Which event could cause Jason swore he would never make that mistake again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jason aced his exam and his professor congratulated him. (B) Jason missed the train to go for office.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jason missed the train to go for office, it would have caused him to be late for work and possibly face consequences from his employer. This would be a more plausible event that could cause Jason to swear he would never make the mistake of waking up late again. Acing an exam and receiving congratulations from a professor may be a positive experience, but it is not directly related to waking up late and would not necessarily cause Jason to make a change in his behavior."}}
{"Q": "I was on the track and field team in high school. Which event could cause At the end, I lost all my energy and got 5th place?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I trained a lot for a meet. (B) I didn't practice much.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) I trained a lot for a meet.\nExplanation: If the person trained a lot for a meet, it is more likely that they pushed themselves to their limits during the event, causing them to lose all their energy and end up in 5th place. On the other hand, if they didn't practice much, they may not have had the endurance to compete at a high level in the first place."}}
{"Q": "I invited my two male friends over to fix my car. Which event could cause I was so shocked, I immediately kicked both of them out?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) they were kissing when I walked back outside. (B) They both didn't know how to fix it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that the two male friends were kissing would be a shocking and unexpected event, especially if the person inviting them over did not know they were in a romantic relationship. This could cause discomfort or offense, leading to the immediate decision to ask them to leave. On the other hand, if they both didn't know how to fix the car, it may be frustrating or inconvenient, but it would not necessarily be a reason to kick them out."}}
{"Q": "Sandy and Bob set out to break a world record. Which event could cause Sandy was mad that they did all that work for nothing?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They almost set it but missed by 2 seconds. (B) Sandy and Bob tried to build the biggest ladder in the world, but they did not have enough time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sandy and Bob tried to build the biggest ladder in the world, but they did not have enough time.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because building the biggest ladder in the world is a specific and measurable goal, whereas \"breaking a world record\" could refer to a variety of different achievements. Additionally, if Sandy and Bob did not have enough time to complete the ladder, it would be a clear failure of their efforts, whereas missing a world record by only 2 seconds could still be seen as a significant accomplishment. Therefore, it is more likely that Sandy would be mad if they did not achieve their specific goal of building the biggest ladder in the world."}}
{"Q": "Kelly loved to paint. Which event could cause And to her great surprise, she won first place?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kelly entered her painting in a contest. (B) Kelly decided to enter a singing contest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Kelly entered her painting in a contest.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Kelly winning first place in a painting contest would be a result of her entering her painting in a competition, rather than suddenly deciding to enter a singing contest. The context of the sentence also suggests that Kelly's love for painting is the focus, making it more probable that the event relates to her passion for art."}}
{"Q": "I hate grooming. Which event could cause I had to cut my hair off?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I messed up on my right side of my car. (B) Because it's too difficult to maintenance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Because it's too difficult to maintenance.\nExplanation: If someone hates grooming and finds it difficult to maintain their hair, they may choose to cut it off. This is a more plausible reason than messing up on the right side of their car, which has no direct correlation to hair grooming."}}
{"Q": "Marsha had just moved in with her husband. Which event could cause Marsha was devastated?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her husband had a miscarriage due to stress. (B) Marsha was told by the landlord she would not be able to keep her dog.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Marsha was told by the landlord she would not be able to keep her dog.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible as it is a common issue that many renters face. Losing a pet can be devastating for pet owners, especially if they have a strong emotional attachment to their pet. On the other hand, it is not possible for a man to have a miscarriage as only women can carry and give birth to a child."}}
{"Q": "Tim took a summer job on a farm. Which event could cause He also earned a deep, dark tan?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had the chance to gamble. (B) Tim earned good money for his tuition.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tim spent long hours working outside in the sun, which caused him to earn a deep, dark tan.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because spending time in the sun without proper protection can cause a person's skin to darken due to increased melanin production. The other option, gambling, has no direct correlation to earning a tan."}}
{"Q": "Becky wanted to improve her cooking skills so she signed up for class. Which event could cause Her boyfriend agreed as well?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Becky had not cooked good food. (B) Becky hated her first class and asked her boyfriend to join in.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Becky enjoyed her first class and wanted her boyfriend to join in, rather than her cooking skills being so bad that her boyfriend felt the need to sign up for the class as well."}}
{"Q": "I read Far from the Madding Crowd in 2006. Which event could cause My son is converting it to mp3?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John, my son decided he wanted to read the book. (B) I hated Far from the Maddening crowd so much, I told my son about it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. John, my son decided he wanted to read the book.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the son wanted to read the book and decided to convert it to mp3 for convenience or to listen to it on the go. It is unlikely that the mother's negative opinion of the book would inspire her son to convert it to mp3."}}
{"Q": "Cornelia had always loved working with her hands. Which event could cause Cornelia uses it as a nightstand in her room?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cornelia re-built an old, broken table. (B) Cornelia decided to make a blanket with the yarn scraps in her garage.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Cornelia re-built an old, broken table.\nExplanation: Since Cornelia loves working with her hands, it is more plausible that she would use her skills to rebuild an old, broken table rather than using her skills to make a blanket with yarn scraps. Additionally, a table would be a more practical item to use as a nightstand in her room."}}
{"Q": "Tim wanted to drive badly. Which event could cause He passed it on the very first try?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim took his algebra test. (B) He took his test.", "R": {"text": "Answer: He took his driving test.\nExplanation: The sentence mentions Tim's desire to drive badly, which suggests that he was eager to obtain his driver's license. Therefore, it is more plausible that passing his driving test on the first try would be the event that caused his excitement, rather than taking an algebra test."}}
{"Q": "Sam loved breakfast. Which event could cause Sam ate three waffles this morning?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Breakfast ate a lot at Sam. (B) Sam found his favorite waffles in the freezer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sam found his favorite waffles in the freezer.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Sam's love for breakfast and explains why he ate three waffles specifically. If breakfast ate a lot at Sam, it doesn't necessarily explain why he ate three waffles. However, finding his favorite waffles in the freezer would be a logical reason for Sam to indulge in a larger breakfast portion."}}
{"Q": "I wanted a pet for my birthday. Which event could cause I brought a dog home since I have so many dogs already?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) So I went to the Dollar Store. (B) So I went to the Dog Pound.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Going to the Dog Pound is a more plausible event that could lead to bringing a dog home, especially if the person already has a history of owning dogs. Going to the Dollar Store does not have any connection to getting a pet."}}
{"Q": "Louisa loved roller coasters. Which event could cause She beat the game in a day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Louisa bought roller coaster tycoon. (B) Louisa played the line coaster simulator.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Louisa bought roller coaster tycoon.\nExplanation: Roller coaster tycoon is a popular video game that allows players to design and manage their own amusement parks, including building and operating roller coasters. It is more likely that Louisa beat the game in a day by playing roller coaster tycoon, rather than playing a line coaster simulator, which may not even exist as a game. Additionally, roller coaster tycoon is a game that is known for its addictive and engaging gameplay, making it plausible that Louisa could spend an entire day playing and beating the game."}}
{"Q": "Candice loves tacos. Which event could cause Candice got better at making tacos?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Candace could learn how to make tacos. (B) Candace studied the art of taco making.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Candace could learn how to make tacos.\nExplanation: Learning how to make tacos would provide Candice with the necessary skills and knowledge to improve her taco-making abilities. Studying the art of taco making may also help, but it is less likely to result in a tangible improvement without practical experience. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tammy was excited that her family was moving to a new home. Which event could cause When they arrived at their new place Tammy loved it and wasn't scared?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tammy was also afraid. (B) Tammy heard the new house had burned down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Tammy was also afraid.\nExplanation: It is common for children to feel scared or anxious when moving to a new home, especially if it is their first time. However, as Tammy loved the new place and wasn't scared, it is unlikely that the house burning down (choice B) would be the cause. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that Tammy was also afraid, but eventually overcame her fear and grew to love the new home."}}
{"Q": "My friends bought me a gift. Which event could cause I learned to be more careful with knives?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I used a knife to open the gift but ended down cutting myself. (B) It was knives, and I accidentally cut myself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Since the gift was given by friends, it is more likely that the person would use a knife to open it. If they were not careful, they could accidentally cut themselves while using the knife. Option B is also a possibility, but it is less likely since it does not involve the gift directly."}}
{"Q": "I got up from a nap feeling very hungry. Which event could cause After the inspector arrived and killed the rats, I felt very happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I decided not to eat when I saw a rat in the kitchen. (B) I ate a lot of rats in my kitchen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The event of the inspector arriving and killing the rats would not directly cause someone to feel hungry or eat a lot of rats. However, if someone had previously seen a rat in their kitchen and decided not to eat because of it, the removal of the rats by the inspector could alleviate their fear and allow them to feel comfortable eating again, leading to hunger. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John found a wallet on the street with $180 in it. Which event could cause He gave him half the money that was in the wallet?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He couldn't believe his modesty. (B) John, returned the wallet to the owner and was rewarded.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John returned the wallet to the owner and was rewarded for his honesty, rather than him giving away half the money out of sheer modesty."}}
{"Q": "Sean was playing with his guitar one night. Which event could cause No one knocked again but he was certain that it was a noise complaint?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) someone knocked on his wall. (B) The police showed up knocking on his door.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The police showed up knocking on his door.\nExplanation: If someone knocked on his wall, it would not necessarily lead to a noise complaint. However, if the police showed up knocking on his door, it is more likely that they were responding to a noise complaint from a neighbor or someone else in the area. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John loved to paint in the park. Which event could cause John was flattered and agreed to doing the mural?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A business owner replied him to do a mural. (B) john was hired to paint something for someone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A business owner replied him to do a mural.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that John was flattered and agreed to doing the mural because a business owner approached him and showed interest in his work. This would make John feel valued and appreciated, which could lead to him accepting the offer to do the mural. On the other hand, being hired to paint something for someone may not necessarily make John feel flattered or appreciated enough to agree to do a mural."}}
{"Q": "Mary gave her dog Max a bone for Christmas. Which event could cause She gave it back to Max who wagged his tail happily?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Max could not find it so she looked for the bone for him. (B) Mary got an extra anti-cartilage.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it is common for dogs to misplace their toys or bones, and for their owners to help them find it. Option B is not related to the situation and does not make sense in the context of the given information."}}
{"Q": "Kiki was a brand new mother. Which event could cause Kiki and her baby were much happier with her decision?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kiki decided to go back to work. (B) Kiki decided to work from home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Kiki decided to work from home.\nExplanation: Being a new mother can be overwhelming and stressful, and being away from her baby for long periods of time can cause anxiety and guilt. By choosing to work from home, Kiki can be close to her baby and still fulfill her work responsibilities. This can lead to a happier and more fulfilling experience for both Kiki and her baby. On the other hand, if Kiki decided to go back to work, she may have to leave her baby with a caregiver or in daycare, which can cause stress and anxiety for both Kiki and her baby."}}
{"Q": "Luke was entered into a pie eating contest. Which event could cause Luke didn't care to win, he was just happy to eat free pie?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Luke loved pie and was not that competitive. (B) Luke's stomach turned thinking about pie.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Luke loved pie and was not that competitive, it would make sense that he didn't care to win and was just happy to eat free pie. On the other hand, if his stomach turned thinking about pie, it would be unlikely that he would even enter a pie eating contest in the first place."}}
{"Q": "It was the day Amy's new furniture was being delivered. Which event could cause Just then the truck pulled up with the furniture?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was getting anxious and thinking about calling the police. (B) Amy stayed at home for the furniture to arrive.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Amy stayed at home for the furniture to arrive.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Amy was waiting at home for the furniture to arrive, rather than getting anxious and thinking about calling the police. The fact that the truck pulled up just then suggests that Amy was expecting the delivery and had made arrangements to be at home for it."}}
{"Q": "Alan got a gun for his 18th birthday. Which event could cause He then went to sleep?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He put it by his bicycle. (B) He shot at paper targets all day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He put it by his bicycle.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that after receiving a gun as a gift, Alan would handle it responsibly and store it safely before going to sleep. Putting it by his bicycle would be a logical place to store it, rather than shooting at paper targets all day and then going to sleep without properly securing the gun."}}
{"Q": "My friends decided to go to Boomers. Which event could cause Although the arcade closed early, we had a good time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The video games were all out of order, but everything else was open. (B) Boomers doesn't have any of the games we like to play.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If the arcade closed early, it could have been disappointing if the only reason they went to Boomers was to play video games. However, if everything else was open and they were still able to enjoy other activities, they could still have had a good time despite the arcade closing early. Option (B) is less plausible because if Boomers didn't have any of the games they liked to play, it's unlikely they would have gone in the first place and therefore wouldn't have had a good time regardless of whether the arcade closed early or not."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy was walking home from school. Which event could cause When Jimmy got home, his mother let him keep the dog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jimmy found a dog who had no collar on. (B) Jimmy repelled a stray dog who attacked him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jimmy found a dog who had no collar on.\nExplanation: If Jimmy found a dog who had no collar on, it is possible that the dog was a stray and had no owner. Jimmy could have taken the dog home and his mother may have allowed him to keep it as a pet. On the other hand, if Jimmy repelled a stray dog who attacked him, it is unlikely that his mother would let him keep the dog as it could be dangerous and not suitable as a pet."}}
{"Q": "Tom wanted to learn to bowl. Which event could cause He did so well, he won second prize?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A bowling competition entered Tom. (B) He hired a coach before the bowling tournament.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A bowling competition entered Tom.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tom won second prize in a bowling competition he entered, rather than hiring a coach before a tournament. Winning a prize suggests that Tom competed against others, and it is common for bowling competitions to offer prizes for top performers. Hiring a coach may have helped Tom improve his skills, but it does not guarantee a prize in a tournament."}}
{"Q": "Charles still calls the party-line to meet girls. Which event could cause The girl was a blond supermodel washing cars in a wet t-shirt?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A girl picked up the party line. (B) He wanted one of them to be his brother.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. A girl picked up the party line.\nExplanation: If a girl picked up the party line, Charles would have the opportunity to talk to her and potentially arrange a meeting. The description of the girl being a blond supermodel washing cars in a wet t-shirt seems unlikely and unrealistic, making option B less plausible."}}
{"Q": "I turned off my computer and picked up a notebook. Which event could cause I spent most of the time staring at the blacked-out screen?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I started browsing random websites. (B) I don't know what to write.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the person doesn't know what to write, they may spend a lot of time staring at the blank screen, trying to come up with ideas. Browsing random websites would not necessarily result in staring at a blacked-out screen, as there would still be content on the screen to look at."}}
{"Q": "Nina had an asthma attack in school one day. Which event could cause Luckily, another girl had had an inhaler in her purse?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nina, panicked as she realized her inhaler had asmtha. (B) When she rummaged through her backpack she realized she did not bring it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) When she rummaged through her backpack she realized she did not bring it.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is common for people to forget important items like medication when rushing out of the house or packing their bags. It is also more likely that Nina would have checked her backpack before panicking and realizing she did not have her inhaler. Additionally, it is not common for students to carry inhalers in their purses, making option (A) less likely."}}
{"Q": "My boss asked me to find the mean value of a data set. Which event could cause He thanked me for my brilliant insight into the problem?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I gave my boss the answer quickly. (B) My boss gave me the answer quickly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Giving the answer quickly would show that the employee is efficient and knowledgeable in the task given, which could impress the boss and lead to a positive response. However, if the boss gave the answer quickly, there would be no need for the employee to find the mean value, and therefore, the boss would not have thanked the employee for their insight."}}
{"Q": "Leo was throwing a huge party, the invitations were in the mail. Which event could cause However, Leo never put stamps on the invites and no one came?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Leo was excited for the party. (B) No one ended up coming to the zoo.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Leo never put stamps on the invites.\nExplanation: This is the most plausible answer as it directly explains why no one came to the party. Without stamps, the invitations would not have been delivered to the guests, resulting in no one showing up. Choice (A) is not a valid explanation as excitement for the party does not affect the delivery of invitations. Choice (B) is also not a valid explanation as it is unrelated to the party and does not explain why no one came."}}
{"Q": "Noah was playing in his treehouse. Which event could cause He was so glad?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Noah saw his friend coming towards his house. (B) Noah had fun with his friends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Noah saw his friend coming towards his house.\nExplanation: Seeing his friend coming towards his house would likely make Noah glad because he would have someone to play with and share his treehouse with. Having fun with his friends (option B) could also make him glad, but it is not as specific to the given scenario."}}
{"Q": "Rupert worked as a program leader keeping track of schedules. Which event could cause Rupert is glad that he is so close to retirement?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rupert hates his job. (B) Rupert loves his job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Rupert hates his job.\nExplanation: If Rupert hates his job, then any event that causes him stress or frustration could make him glad that he is close to retirement. For example, if there is a major scheduling conflict or if he is dealing with difficult colleagues, he may feel relieved that he won't have to deal with these issues for much longer. On the other hand, if Rupert loves his job, he may be sad to retire and may not be looking forward to leaving his role as a program leader."}}
{"Q": "Adam fell asleep at a sleepover. Which event could cause Adam was so embarrassed he blushed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Adam woke up with drawings on his face. (B) Adam woke up to all his friends talking to him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Waking up with drawings on his face is a common prank that friends play on each other during sleepovers. It is plausible that Adam would be embarrassed and blush upon realizing that his friends had drawn on his face while he was asleep. On the other hand, waking up to all his friends talking to him is not necessarily embarrassing and would not likely cause Adam to blush."}}
{"Q": "Jill's two cats had kittens in the same week. Which event could cause Jill gave them to the other cat, who looked grateful?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jill decided she had too many credit cards. (B) One of Jill's cats had way more than the other.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jill gave some of the kittens to the other cat because one of her cats had way more than the other. It is unlikely that Jill's decision to have too many credit cards would have any impact on her cats and their kittens."}}
{"Q": "Rob hated the second grade. Which event could cause They decided to homeschool him for the rest of the year?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rob was having a hard time adjusting. (B) Rob talked to his dog.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Rob was having a hard time adjusting.\nExplanation: If Rob was struggling to adjust to the second grade, it could have resulted in poor academic performance, behavioral issues, or emotional distress. Homeschooling could be seen as a solution to provide a more personalized and supportive learning environment for Rob. On the other hand, talking to his dog, as in option B, is not a significant enough reason to switch to homeschooling."}}
{"Q": "Joy was jealous when she didn't get an invitation to a sleep-over. Which event could cause But Joy's mom heard of the infestation and made her clean the house?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joy's house was a sad place to be. (B) The sleep over was canceled after lice was found.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The sleep over was canceled after lice was found.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly relates to the infestation mentioned in the question. Joy's mom may have heard about the lice infestation at the sleepover and decided to cancel it, which would have caused Joy to miss out on the event. Additionally, it makes sense that Joy's mom would then make her clean the house to prevent any potential lice from spreading to their home. Option (A) is not as likely because it does not have a clear connection to the infestation mentioned in the question."}}
{"Q": "Curt worked for Lu's grandfather in a deli in Selma, Indiana. Which event could cause Lu and Curt got married and moved to Selma, Alabama?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lu would visit Kurt everyday at lunch. (B) Curt was dating Lu, but they broke up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Lu visited Curt everyday at lunch, it is possible that they developed a closer relationship and decided to get married and move to Selma, Alabama together. However, if they broke up, it is unlikely that they would end up getting married and moving to a different Selma."}}
{"Q": "Clay plays baseball for a living. Which event could cause Clay cannot pitch the rest of the season due to his injury?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) he ended up breaking his arm. (B) Clay injured his refuse in a game.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Breaking his arm would be a more plausible reason for Clay to not be able to pitch for the rest of the season as it is a serious injury that would require a significant amount of time to heal and recover from. In contrast, injuring his refuse (which is not a commonly known body part) may not necessarily prevent him from pitching for the rest of the season."}}
{"Q": "Carl had three kids and a wife. Which event could cause It only took Carl 20 minutes to remember how much he hates his life?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Carl went on vacation. (B) Carl had some time alone when his dog was away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Carl had some time alone when his dog was away.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Carl's family and responsibilities were causing him stress and frustration, and having some time alone without his dog (who may have been another responsibility) allowed him to reflect on his life and feel overwhelmed by negative emotions. A vacation may have provided temporary relief, but it is less likely to cause such a strong negative reaction upon returning home."}}
{"Q": "Molly turned 5 Year's old today. Which event could cause This was her best birthday so far?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Molly bought her parents a kitten for her birthday. (B) Parents hired magicians for his birthday party.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Parents hired magicians for his birthday party.\nExplanation: It is more likely that having magicians at her birthday party would make it the best one so far, as it would be a fun and exciting experience for Molly and her friends. While buying her parents a kitten is a kind gesture, it may not necessarily make her own birthday the best one yet."}}
{"Q": "Hank was looking for a new religion. Which event could cause Hank ended up joining this new religion?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The old religion was very wild. (B) The new religion was very peaceful.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Hank was looking for a new religion, it is more plausible that he would join a new religion that is very peaceful, rather than leaving his old religion because it was very wild. People often seek out religions that align with their personal values and beliefs, and if Hank was looking for a change, it is likely that he would be attracted to a religion that promotes peace and harmony."}}
{"Q": "Amy and Kim stayed over Lynn's house. Which event could cause Lynn ended up convincing her to break curfew and sneak out again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Katies parents were not okay with her being out that late. (B) Lynn had gotten in trouble last time for sneaking out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Katie's parents were not okay with her being out that late, it would not necessarily affect Lynn's decision to break curfew and sneak out again. However, if Lynn felt that Amy and Kim were having a good time and did not want to end the night early, she may be convinced to break curfew if Katie's parents were okay with it. On the other hand, if Lynn had gotten in trouble last time for sneaking out, she would be less likely to do it again, making option (B) less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Eli didn't know much about using Microsoft Access. Which event could cause Eli easily updated the column's values?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Eli checked for Access examples online. (B) Eli watched an online tutorial to find out how to copy values in a column.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Watching an online tutorial to find out how to copy values in a column would be a more plausible event to help Eli easily update the column's values. Checking for Access examples online may provide some guidance, but it may not specifically address the issue of updating column values. Watching a tutorial, on the other hand, would provide step-by-step instructions on how to perform the task, making it easier for Eli to update the column's values."}}
{"Q": "While out on a hike gloria ran into a snake. Which event could cause She kept her eyes open for more snakes on the trail?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was became convinced that this was the only snake there. (B) she started to walk in the opposite direction.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She started to walk in the opposite direction.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gloria would become cautious and aware of her surroundings after encountering a snake, rather than becoming convinced that it was the only snake in the area. Walking in the opposite direction would also be a natural response to avoid any potential danger."}}
{"Q": "Ben spent hours putting up Christmas lights. Which event could cause After resetting the breaker, the lights came back on?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben finally finished and plugged them in and the electric went out. (B) He like easter lights.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Choice A is the most plausible answer because it suggests that the electric went out due to an overload caused by the Christmas lights. Resetting the breaker would have allowed the electric to come back on and the lights to work again. Choice B is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the problem of the lights not working."}}
{"Q": "My grandmother and I used to go to the park for picnics. Which event could cause The important part was just spending time with her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My grandmothers sandwiches were awful, but I didn't mind. (B) My grandmothers temper was awful.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that the sandwiches were not good but the narrator didn't mind suggests that the focus was not on the food, but rather on spending time with their grandmother. This reinforces the idea that the important part was just being together, regardless of the quality of the food. On the other hand, option B suggests that there may have been tension or conflict during the picnics, which would detract from the enjoyment of spending time with the grandmother."}}
{"Q": "Greg went to the park hoping to play a game of basketball. Which event could cause Greg was relieved that he was going to get to play?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Greg forgot his ball and asked some people to play. (B) Greg was the lead actor in the play.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Greg forgot his ball and asked some people to play, it means that he found people to play with and he would be able to play basketball. This would cause him to feel relieved and happy that he could still play the game he wanted to play. Option B is not a plausible answer as it has nothing to do with Greg playing basketball at the park."}}
{"Q": "I was in Fourth grade. Which event could cause I was the spelling bee champion?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) After minutes of practice, I was ready to compete in the fourth grade spelling bee. (B) I got asked to be in the spelling bee.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) After minutes of practice, I was ready to compete in the fourth grade spelling bee.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the student became the spelling bee champion after practicing for the competition rather than just being randomly asked to participate. Practice and preparation are key factors in succeeding in any competition, including a spelling bee."}}
{"Q": "Mel got a summer job at the ice cream parlor. Which event could cause Mel suddenly loved her summer job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mel got a small bonus one day. (B) Mel was afraid to start a job but made some new friends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Getting a small bonus one day could cause Mel to suddenly love her summer job because it would show that her hard work is appreciated and valued by her employer. This could boost her morale and make her feel more motivated to continue working hard and enjoying her job. Making new friends is also a positive experience, but it may not necessarily cause someone to suddenly love their job."}}
{"Q": "My partner realized she is depressed this year. Which event could cause The struggle made her a stronger person?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My partner overcame her depression. (B) She began to see a doctor to help her with her heartburn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My partner overcame her depression.\nExplanation: Overcoming depression is a significant and challenging accomplishment that requires a lot of strength and resilience. It is a struggle that can make a person stronger by teaching them coping mechanisms, self-care, and self-awareness. On the other hand, seeing a doctor for heartburn, while important, is not likely to have the same impact on a person's strength and resilience. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jay was working at his job, a restaurant. Which event could cause Jay had to give it to her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) But Jay owe money to his sister for a package. (B) A guy came in to pick up his order.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jay had to give his shift to someone else because he owed money to his sister for a package. This suggests that Jay may have had a personal emergency or financial obligation that required him to take time off from work. On the other hand, a guy coming in to pick up his order is a routine event that would not necessarily require Jay to give up his shift."}}
{"Q": "Patsy was in charge of lining up people to work at a football game. Which event could cause Another group had to bring more to help out so that we had enough?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Patsy did not have enough resources. (B) She realized there weren't enough hot dogs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Patsy did not have enough resources, such as not enough volunteers or staff, it would make sense that another group had to bring more to help out. However, the lack of hot dogs would not necessarily require another group to bring more people to help out."}}
{"Q": "Jeremy's mother didn't approve of his lifestyle. Which event could cause Jeremy had to move back in with his mother?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) he went to go live with his father. (B) Jeremy lost his job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jeremy lost his job.\nExplanation: If Jeremy lost his job, he may not be able to afford his current living situation and may have to move back in with his mother. Going to live with his father is not a plausible answer as it does not address the issue of his mother disapproving of his lifestyle."}}
{"Q": "Ray loved to go hiking. Which event could cause Ray was able to hike again with the help of the brace?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) but during a recent trip he broke his leg becouse he did not bring the proper equipment becouse he thought he was a pro. (B) Ray hurt his leg and couldn't afford to get a brace put on.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Choice A is more plausible because it suggests that Ray's injury was caused by a mistake he made, rather than a lack of resources or financial means. Additionally, the fact that he was able to hike again with the help of a brace implies that his injury was not too severe, which is consistent with a broken leg caused by a fall rather than a more serious injury."}}
{"Q": "Ben and Pam have been arguing a lot lately. Which event could cause Ben and Pam are a lot happier and are still married?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben and Pam went to couples therapy, and learned that they were not understanding each other. (B) They decided to go their separate ways.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Going to couples therapy and learning how to better understand each other is a common and effective way to improve communication and resolve conflicts in a marriage. It shows a willingness to work on the relationship and find a solution, rather than giving up and going separate ways. Therefore, it is more plausible that Ben and Pam would be happier and still married after going to couples therapy."}}
{"Q": "The hikers suddenly stopped in their tracks. Which event could cause The hikers turned into sprinters, likely setting a record or two?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The hikers stumbled on a tree branch. (B) The hikers stumbled on a bear and her cubs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Stumbling upon a bear and her cubs is a more plausible event that could cause the hikers to turn into sprinters and set a record or two. This is because encountering a bear and her cubs can be a dangerous situation and the hikers would need to quickly run away to avoid any harm. Stumbling on a tree branch may cause the hikers to stop or slow down, but it is unlikely to cause them to sprint and set a record."}}
{"Q": "I needed to get a Christmas present for my father. Which event could cause When he opened his present, he said it was his best gift this year?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I decided to get him a tool he wanted. (B) I bought him a new pizza.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Since the father wanted a tool, it is more likely that he would be thrilled to receive it as a gift. It shows that the giver paid attention to his interests and needs, and it is a practical gift that he can use. On the other hand, a new pizza may be enjoyable, but it is not likely to be the best gift of the year."}}
{"Q": "Kenny was lost on the streets. Which event could cause The driver ended up finding it and dropped him off?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kenny lost his wedding ring in the taxi. (B) He didn't know where he wanted to go.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Kenny lost his wedding ring in the taxi, he may have contacted the taxi company or reported it to the police. The driver may have found the ring and recognized Kenny's name or description, leading him to search for Kenny and eventually finding him. On the other hand, if Kenny didn't know where he wanted to go, it would be unlikely for the driver to randomly find him and drop him off at his desired location."}}
{"Q": "Lenny wanted to watch a movie. Which event could cause When he got home, he prepared to return his three movies?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lenny picked out three movies but he'd forgotten his wallet. (B) Lenny's friends invited him to come over.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lenny picked out three movies but he'd forgotten his wallet.\nExplanation: This event could cause Lenny to return his three movies because he wouldn't be able to pay for them without his wallet. He may have realized this after getting home and decided to return the movies until he had his wallet with him. On the other hand, option B doesn't seem to have any connection with Lenny returning his movies."}}
{"Q": "Hank walked on his deck towards his back door. Which event could cause Got his power drill and drilled the board back in place?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A board from Hank's deck broke off as he walked on it. (B) Hank did not notice a baseboard on the deck was loose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If a board broke off as Hank walked on it, it would be logical for him to use his power drill to fix it by drilling the board back in place. On the other hand, if he simply did not notice a loose baseboard, it would not necessarily require the use of a power drill to fix it."}}
{"Q": "Ben had an interview for a promising job. Which event could cause Ben aced his interview and got the job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben learned a lot about the company before his interview so that he would appear keen. (B) Ben prepared the night before with many shots.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Learning about the company before an interview shows that Ben is interested in the job and has done his research. This would make him appear more prepared and knowledgeable during the interview, increasing his chances of acing it and getting the job. On the other hand, preparing for an interview with shots is not a professional or effective way to prepare and could actually harm Ben's chances of getting the job."}}
{"Q": "I read Remembrance of Things Past in 2008. Which event could cause I was happy to have read such a long work?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I felt triumphant as I read the first page. (B) It recently came up in a game of trivia.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the event of Remembrance of Things Past coming up in a game of trivia would cause the person to feel happy about having read such a long work. This event would validate the time and effort the person put into reading the book and would also give them a sense of pride in their knowledge and accomplishment. Feeling triumphant after reading the first page is unlikely as it is too early in the reading process to make such a judgment."}}
{"Q": "We had a lot of mice in 2011. Which event could cause I killed several mice that way?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) One way we got rid of them was with the use of a BB gun. (B) We decided to get raccoon traps.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Using a BB gun to get rid of mice is a more plausible answer as it is a common method of pest control and can be effective in eliminating small rodents like mice. Raccoon traps are not typically used for mice and would not be as effective in controlling a large infestation."}}
{"Q": "My sister is going to have a baby. Which event could cause It's a girl?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My sister wished for a girl. (B) She went to get a mammogram.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My sister wished for a girl.\nExplanation: The sex of a baby is determined by the chromosomes from the father's sperm. While there are some methods that claim to increase the chances of having a girl, such as timing intercourse or altering the mother's diet, these methods are not scientifically proven. Therefore, it is more plausible that the sex of the baby is determined by chance and not by a mammogram. However, it is possible that the sister's wish for a girl could influence her behavior and choices during pregnancy, such as choosing certain names or clothing, which could indirectly contribute to the perception of the baby's gender."}}
{"Q": "There once was a princess who tried to write a story. Which event could cause Then the prince and the princess lived happily ever after?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The princess never met a prince and fell in love. (B) She sat and wrote a novel that was read around the world.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The princess never met a prince and fell in love.\nExplanation: The phrase \"Then the prince and the princess lived happily ever after\" is commonly used as the ending of fairy tales where the main characters fall in love and get married. Since the prompt states that the princess tried to write a story, it is more plausible that the story she wrote was a fairy tale where she never met a prince and fell in love, leading to a happy ending where she lives happily ever after on her own. Option B, where she writes a novel that is read around the world, does not necessarily have a connection to the prince and the princess living happily ever after."}}
{"Q": "Diana order a set of pregnancy tests. Which event could cause She was in tears since the results were positive?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Diana was suddenly sleepy. (B) Diana isn't ready to have a kid.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Diana isn't ready to have a kid.\nExplanation: The fact that Diana was in tears after receiving positive results from the pregnancy test suggests that she was not expecting or ready to have a child. This emotional response is not typically associated with feeling sleepy, making option (A) less plausible."}}
{"Q": "While I was in Hawaii, I was able to golf at Kapalua. Which event could cause I had one of my best rounds and best experiences golfing there?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather was perfect and the course is away from the tourists part of the island. (B) I got a hole in seven.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The weather and location of the course are more likely to have a significant impact on the overall experience and quality of the round than getting a single hole in seven. Additionally, being away from the tourist areas may have allowed for a more peaceful and enjoyable round."}}
{"Q": "Rob tried to be patient as he waiting in line. Which event could cause When his turn was up he got right back in line?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rob left the line and went home. (B) He slid down the slide.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Rob got frustrated and left the line, he wouldn't have gotten back in line. Option B is completely unrelated to the situation and doesn't make sense as a possible cause for Rob getting back in line."}}
{"Q": "I felt out of shape. Which event could cause I was happy when I made it to the top?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I decided to climb down the hill anyway. (B) I was doing diet and exercise for a while.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the person was doing diet and exercise for a while, it is more likely that they were able to climb to the top of a hill without feeling out of breath or exhausted. This would make them happy and proud of their progress in getting back in shape. Climbing down the hill anyway (option A) does not necessarily indicate that the person was happy about it, and it does not necessarily require being in shape."}}
{"Q": "Amy was sitting on a swing at Lynn's house. Which event could cause She realized at 14, they were getting too old for swing sets?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The swing was too small for her to get on it. (B) The swingset chain nearly broke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The swing was too small for her to get on it.\nExplanation: As Amy grew older, she would have naturally grown taller and bigger, making it difficult for her to fit on a small swing meant for younger children. This realization would have made her feel like she was outgrowing the swing set and that it was time to move on to other activities. On the other hand, the swingset chain nearly breaking would have been a safety concern and would have caused immediate action to be taken, rather than a gradual realization of outgrowing the swing set."}}
{"Q": "Gina returned to her bedroom ready to work on her report. Which event could cause Instead she talked on the phone for 2 hours?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina turned off her phone when a friend called. (B) Gina's best friend called her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Gina's best friend called her.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is common for people to get distracted by phone calls from close friends. Gina may have intended to work on her report, but when her best friend called, she may have felt compelled to answer and engage in a lengthy conversation. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Gina would turn off her phone when a friend called, as this would be considered rude and may not be a realistic scenario."}}
{"Q": "Carey walked her dog in the dog park every day. Which event could cause Now Carey walks 9 dogs in the dog park every day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Carey put flyers out to offer to walk other dogs. (B) One day someone hired her to eat their dog.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Carey put flyers out to offer to walk other dogs, which resulted in her walking 9 dogs in the dog park every day. It is unlikely that someone hired her to eat their dog, as that is illegal and morally reprehensible."}}
{"Q": "Lucy was waiting for a delivery from Schwan's. Which event could cause Grandma had ordered her favorite ice cream just for Lucy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy was expecting to fast like her Grandma. (B) Lucy was given ice cream.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Lucy was given ice cream.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Grandma ordered Lucy's favorite ice cream because she knew Lucy would enjoy it, rather than ordering it for herself and then changing her mind about fasting. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely event that could cause Grandma to order Lucy's favorite ice cream."}}
{"Q": "Once, there was a very fat man. Which event could cause They tried to bury him, but he was too fat for the coffin?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He lost so much weight he died. (B) He passed away from his heart being overburdened.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He passed away from his heart being overburdened.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man passed away due to his weight causing strain on his heart, rather than losing so much weight that he died. In this scenario, it is likely that the man's body was too large to fit into a standard-sized coffin, leading to the need for a larger one or alternative arrangements for his burial."}}
{"Q": "Rufus has wanted to see his son Jonathan for several months. Which event could cause Rufus feels great that he finally got to see his son?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) rufus made a special trip. (B) Rufus made the trek to see his son, and his son was happy to see him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it not only involves Rufus making an effort to see his son, but also includes the positive outcome of his son being happy to see him. This would likely bring Rufus a great deal of joy and satisfaction, making it a more likely event to cause him to feel great. Option A does not provide any indication of how the visit went or if Rufus was able to see his son, making it less likely to be the cause of his happiness."}}
{"Q": "Priya decided to try a new restaurant. Which event could cause Priya decided not to eat and left?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Priya saw a rat run across the floor. (B) Fortunately, the service was great and the food looked delicious.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Priya saw a rat run across the floor.\nExplanation: Seeing a rat in a restaurant is a health hazard and can be a major turn off for customers. It is a plausible reason for Priya to decide not to eat and leave the restaurant. On the other hand, good service and delicious-looking food would not be a reason for Priya to leave the restaurant."}}
{"Q": "Will wanted to quit smoking. Which event could cause He finally quit smoking?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Will ceased buying cigarettes at the store. (B) Will kept buying cigarettes at the store.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Will ceased buying cigarettes at the store.\nExplanation: If Will stops buying cigarettes, he will not have access to them and will be less likely to smoke. This is a common strategy for quitting smoking and has a higher likelihood of success compared to continuing to buy cigarettes."}}
{"Q": "I once went on an ice skating date with someone. Which event could cause He laughed and suggested we do something else?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was a great skater. (B) We both were terrible and fell a lot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If both individuals were terrible at skating and kept falling, it could have been frustrating and not enjoyable for either of them. Laughing and suggesting to do something else could have been a way to salvage the date and have a better time doing something they were both more comfortable with."}}
{"Q": "Tess and Jane took the vow. Which event could cause They hugged each other and went outside to play?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tess and Jane decided to play very carefully. (B) They agreed that they were done playing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tess and Jane decided to play very carefully.\nExplanation: Since Tess and Jane took a vow, it is more likely that they would want to continue playing but with more caution and care. This would lead them to hug each other and go outside to play carefully. Option B, where they agreed to be done playing, does not seem as likely given that they just took a vow and would want to continue playing together."}}
{"Q": "I was playing guitar in my room. Which event could cause I grabbed a replacement string and went back to playing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I broke a finger. (B) In my enthusiasm, I broke one of the strings.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the player broke a string due to their enthusiasm while playing rather than breaking a finger, which would likely cause them to stop playing altogether. Additionally, it is common for guitar players to keep replacement strings on hand for when this happens."}}
{"Q": "Bill's ambition was to be a lawyer. Which event could cause After winning money from his lawsuit, he no longer needed a job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bill went to law school to be a lawyer. (B) Bill went to law school to be a bailiff.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Bill went to law school to be a lawyer.\nExplanation: If Bill's ambition was to be a lawyer, it is more plausible that winning money from his lawsuit would allow him to pursue his dream career by attending law school and becoming a lawyer. It is unlikely that winning money from a lawsuit would lead him to pursue a career as a bailiff, which is a different profession altogether."}}
{"Q": "Terry got drunk with his friends in the daytime. Which event could cause Terry stopped being friends with them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terry got caught screwing up at school because he was drunk. (B) Terry's friends thought Terry was an alcoholic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Getting caught screwing up at school because of being drunk is a more plausible reason for Terry to stop being friends with his friends. This event could have serious consequences for Terry's future and could make him realize that his friends' behavior is not worth risking his education and future opportunities. On the other hand, Terry's friends thinking he is an alcoholic may not necessarily be true and could be based on assumptions or misunderstandings."}}
{"Q": "I always hate PE. Which event could cause I tripped and ended up knocking three teeth out, I hate PE?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was spontaneoused to take PE anyway. (B) The coach made me run the track.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the physical activity of running on the track caused the individual to trip and knock out their teeth, leading to a negative association with PE. Being spontaneously forced to take PE may not necessarily result in a specific event that causes injury or discomfort."}}
{"Q": "Dave loved the outdoors. Which event could cause Dave backed away slowly?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When Dave went on a hike, he spotted a wild wolf. (B) Dave encountered the outdoors.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Seeing a wild wolf while on a hike could be a potentially dangerous situation, causing Dave to back away slowly. Despite his love for the outdoors, encountering a wild animal can be intimidating and cause anyone to be cautious. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is too vague and does not provide a specific event that would cause Dave to back away."}}
{"Q": "Sean posted an ad for guitar lessons online. Which event could cause When he was done, they paid him and he went home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sean got his first client, but when he went to their house to teach, they weren't home. (B) A local organization saw his ad out there and hired him for some group lessons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Sean actually had a client who was interested in his services and was willing to pay him. Option B suggests that a local organization randomly stumbled upon his ad and hired him without any prior communication or negotiation, which is less likely to happen. Additionally, option A provides a clear reason for Sean to leave after being paid, whereas option B does not."}}
{"Q": "Sally was driving late at night. Which event could cause The homeowner was speechless?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sally fell asleep and hit a car. (B) Sally fell asleep and drive into a neighbor's house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it involves Sally driving into a neighbor's house, which would be a shocking and unexpected event for the homeowner. Option A involves Sally hitting a car, which while still a serious event, is not as likely to leave the homeowner speechless. Additionally, the fact that Sally fell asleep while driving adds to the shock value of option B."}}
{"Q": "Jake just moved into his new house. Which event could cause Zach regrets moving to this neighborhood?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jake's roommate Zach loves the local community. (B) There is a lot of gang members and noise outside.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If there are a lot of gang members and noise outside, it could make Zach regret moving to the neighborhood due to safety concerns and disturbance. On the other hand, Jake's roommate loving the local community may not necessarily have a negative impact on Zach's decision to move to the neighborhood."}}
{"Q": "Lily desperately wanted a baby of her own. Which event could cause Jenny adopted her niece and at last had a baby?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lily had a great birth. (B) Lily's sister Jenny, couldn't have a baby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Lily's sister Jenny couldn't have a baby.\nExplanation: If Lily's sister Jenny couldn't have a baby, she may have decided to adopt her niece. This would have given Lily the opportunity to be around a baby and potentially fulfill her desire to have one of her own. Additionally, after adopting her niece, Jenny may have decided to have a baby of her own through alternative means such as IVF or surrogacy."}}
{"Q": "Sam wanted to be an elf for Halloween. Which event could cause Sam was a very convincing elf?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam made a costume out of material he bought from the store and he found some plastic elf ears online. (B) Sam bought a robot costume and wore it for Halloween.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Sam's goal was to be an elf for Halloween, so buying a robot costume would not help him achieve that goal. Making a costume out of materials and finding elf ears online would be a more plausible way for Sam to become a convincing elf."}}
{"Q": "Amy had taken her sister Ali with to a friends house. Which event could cause Amy was dreading going home knowing her mother would blame her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy had lost her sister Amy. (B) Ali wasn't supposed to be out that day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Ali wasn't supposed to be out that day.\nExplanation: If Ali wasn't supposed to be out that day, it means that Amy had taken her sister without permission or against their mother's wishes. This could lead to Amy being blamed by their mother for not following the rules or being responsible enough to take care of her sister. Losing her sister (option A) could also be a cause for concern, but it is less likely to result in Amy being blamed by their mother."}}
{"Q": "James was a student studying law. Which event could cause When he got the results back, he did very well?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) James studied hard for a major exam. (B) James dropped out and now attends bar at a popular nightclub.", "R": {"text": "Answer: James studied hard for a major exam.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that James did well on his results because he studied hard for a major exam. Dropping out and becoming a bartender would not typically lead to good academic results in law."}}
{"Q": "Tim wanted to become a YouTube star. Which event could cause Tim made millions from his videos on YouTube?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim posted funny cat videos to Youtube. (B) Tim worked lazily creating videos.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tim posted funny cat videos to Youtube.\nExplanation: Posting funny cat videos to Youtube has been a popular trend for years and has been known to attract a large audience. If Tim's videos went viral and gained a significant following, he could potentially make millions from ad revenue, sponsorships, and merchandise sales. However, lazily creating videos is unlikely to attract a large audience and would not lead to Tim making millions from his videos."}}
{"Q": "Lars had always wanted to try photography. Which event could cause Lars fell in love with photography?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lars had amazing original photographs and he got an awesome award. (B) Lars received prestigious awards for several original photographs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Lars had a natural talent for photography and was able to produce amazing original photographs, which led to him receiving an awesome award. This recognition and validation of his skills could have sparked a love for photography in Lars and motivated him to continue pursuing it as a hobby or even a career. Option B suggests that Lars received prestigious awards for several original photographs, but it doesn't necessarily indicate that he fell in love with photography as a result. It could have been a one-time achievement or something he did for the recognition rather than a genuine passion for the art form."}}
{"Q": "Sam worried about the math exam he had later in the day. Which event could cause When the test came, he forgot all the important formulas due to stress?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam focused well during the test. (B) When Sam sat down in math class, he started sweating profusely.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) When Sam sat down in math class, he started sweating profusely.\nExplanation: Sweating profusely is a common physical symptom of stress and anxiety. This suggests that Sam was experiencing a high level of stress before the exam, which could have affected his ability to remember important formulas during the test. While it is possible that Sam could have still performed well despite his stress, forgetting important formulas is a common consequence of test anxiety. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Alec didn't like the fall. Which event could cause The only difference was that it keeps becoming easier as he grows?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alec got older and hated fall. (B) He hated raking the heavy piles of leaves.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement \"The only difference was that it keeps becoming easier as he grows\" suggests that there was a specific task or activity that Alec disliked in the fall, and that task became easier for him as he grew older. Raking heavy piles of leaves is a common task in the fall, and it makes sense that it would become easier for Alec as he grew stronger and more capable. Option A is less plausible because it suggests that Alec's dislike of fall was solely based on his age, which is not supported by the given statement."}}
{"Q": "Jon needed to find a job. Which event could cause Finally, Jon had a job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jon created a job agency for hiring companies. (B) He sent his facebook link to many places.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Sending his Facebook link to many places is a more plausible answer as it shows Jon actively seeking employment and reaching out to potential employers. Creating a job agency would require a significant amount of time, resources, and experience, which may not be feasible for Jon at the moment."}}
{"Q": "Anna was jogging with her phone in her pocket. Which event could cause She was so relieved to see it wasn't cracked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anne dropped her phone. (B) Anna's phone fell out of her pocket into nearby water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Anna dropped her phone while jogging, it is more likely that it fell on a solid surface like concrete or pavement, which could cause the screen to crack. However, if she simply checked her phone after jogging and saw that it wasn't cracked, it is more plausible that she did not drop it and it remained in her pocket the whole time."}}
{"Q": "Bob wanted a hamburger. Which event could cause He was excited?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His wife told him she had a great new hamburger recipe to try. (B) Bob's mother said he couldn't eat hamburgers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) His wife told him she had a great new hamburger recipe to try.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause excitement because it involves a positive and desirable outcome for Bob - trying a new and potentially delicious hamburger recipe. On the other hand, being told he can't eat hamburgers by his mother (B) is more likely to cause disappointment or frustration rather than excitement."}}
{"Q": "Last night I decided to cook dinner for my boyfriend. Which event could cause My boyfriend still liked it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I lost part of the recipe while cooking dinner. (B) I made delicious pasta.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the boyfriend enjoyed the dinner because the pasta was delicious, rather than despite the fact that the recipe was lost. Making delicious food is usually the most important factor in determining whether someone likes a meal or not."}}
{"Q": "Mark had always taken monthly hunting trips with his dad. Which event could cause Mark still got to bond with his dad - over laughter and popcorn?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mark's dad broke his leg. (B) Mark broke his leg thus no more hunting.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Mark's dad broke his leg, they would not be able to go on hunting trips or engage in any physical activities together. However, they could still bond over laughter and popcorn while his dad is recovering from his injury. This scenario is more plausible than option B where Mark is the one who broke his leg and cannot go on hunting trips anymore."}}
{"Q": "One Halloween, Gray was playing a game to find candy. Which event could cause At the end of the game, Gray had no candy because he would put it bac?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gray was giving other children candy. (B) Gray loved the game so much that he kept putting the candy back to find again.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Gray loved the game so much that he kept putting the candy back to find again.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gray was enjoying the game so much that he kept putting the candy back to find again, rather than giving it away to other children. This behavior is common in children who are excited about a game or activity and want to keep playing it repeatedly."}}
{"Q": "Cindy was stressed out recently. Which event could cause She ended up walking more frequently?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She went inside for fresh air and realize that is what she needed. (B) Cindy felt better after taking a long walk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Cindy felt better after taking a long walk.\nExplanation: When people are stressed, physical activity can be a great way to relieve tension and improve mood. Taking a long walk is a common way to do this, as it allows for time to clear one's head and get some fresh air. Option (A) suggests that Cindy went inside for fresh air and realized that's what she needed, but it doesn't explain why she started walking more frequently. Option (B) directly links Cindy's stress to her increased walking, making it the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jakub had hoped to spend his entire life living in America. Which event could cause Jakub was very sad to say goodbye to his life in America?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jakub had to go home to visit family. (B) Jakub's visa was rejected and had to go home to Canada.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jakub's visa was rejected and had to go home to Canada.\nExplanation: If Jakub's visa was rejected, he would have to leave America and return to his home country of Canada. This would be a very sad event for him as he had hoped to spend his entire life in America. Going home to visit family, on the other hand, would not necessarily cause him to say goodbye to his life in America permanently."}}
{"Q": "For Halloween me and my sister wanted to dress as witches. Which event could cause Now to choose who is who?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My sister and I got a good witch costume and a bad witch costume. (B) My sister and I both got a good witch costume.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If my sister and I both got good witch costumes, there would be no clear way to determine who is who. However, if we have a good witch costume and a bad witch costume, it would make sense for Now to choose who gets to be the good witch and who gets to be the bad witch. This adds an element of fun and creativity to our costumes and allows us to fully embrace our witchy personas."}}
{"Q": "Gary always brought his lunch to work. Which event could cause Gary was very upset and went hungry?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) However, today Gary left his lunch at home. (B) A coworker of Garies ate his wallet and Gary didn't have any money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. However, today Gary left his lunch at home.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is a common mistake that people make. Forgetting to bring lunch to work can happen to anyone and can cause someone to go hungry for the day. On the other hand, option B is highly unlikely and unrealistic as it is not possible for a coworker to eat someone's wallet."}}
{"Q": "Mother told Tommy not to play with matches. Which event could cause The matches lit the paper in the trash bin and the house burned down?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When Mother went to bed, Tommy got the matches. (B) Mother played with matches anyway.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The event where Tommy got the matches when Mother went to bed is more plausible because it follows the initial warning from Mother not to play with matches. It also shows that Tommy disobeyed his mother's instructions, leading to the potential danger of starting a fire. On the other hand, option B is not plausible as it contradicts the initial statement that Mother told Tommy not to play with matches."}}
{"Q": "Lisa has a beautiful sapphire ring. Which event could cause She was elated when she found it on the bathroom floor?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One day, Lisa found her ring. (B) One day, Lisa lost her ring.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) One day, Lisa lost her ring.\nExplanation: If Lisa found her ring without losing it, it wouldn't make sense for her to be elated. However, if she lost her ring and then found it on the bathroom floor, it would be a relief and cause for celebration."}}
{"Q": "Alice was getting married in a few weeks. Which event could cause Alice messaged a cute guy she saw on Tinder?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice decided to have a big wedding. (B) Alice decided to break off the wedding.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alice, feeling the pressure of planning a big wedding, may have messaged a cute guy on Tinder as a way to alleviate stress or seek validation. Breaking off the wedding would be a more drastic decision and may not necessarily lead to messaging someone on Tinder."}}
{"Q": "Max woke up one Christmas morning. Which event could cause Max hugged his dad and started to cry?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Max discovered his dad hadn't been able to make it home for the holiday. (B) Max got a bike.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Max hugging his dad and crying suggests a strong emotional response, which is more likely to be caused by a negative event such as his dad not being able to make it home for the holiday. Getting a bike is a happy event, but it is less likely to elicit such a strong emotional response."}}
{"Q": "Lina has two kids. Which event could cause Lina made her kids wear clothes from the pile?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lina received a pile of adult clothes. (B) Lina didn't have time to wash school clothes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Lina didn't have time to wash school clothes.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Lina would make her kids wear clothes from the pile if she didn't have time to wash their school clothes rather than receiving a pile of adult clothes. It is a common practice for parents to have a pile of spare clothes for their children in case of emergencies or when they don't have time to do laundry."}}
{"Q": "I went to japan last summer. Which event could cause I had a lot of fun and returned home with many memories?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I went to all the festivals. (B) The country was boring.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) I went to all the festivals.\nExplanation: Japan is known for its numerous festivals throughout the year, each with its unique traditions and activities. Attending these festivals would have provided a lot of opportunities for fun and creating memories. Additionally, festivals are a great way to experience the local culture and interact with the locals, making the trip more enjoyable. Therefore, it is more plausible that attending festivals would have caused the person to have a lot of fun and return home with many memories."}}
{"Q": "I purchased an expensive sofa from a high end furniture store. Which event could cause I called each month and after two Year's, they told me to keep it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The store mistakenly gave me an extra pillow. (B) Right away, I knew I would love the sofa.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the customer loved the sofa right away, it is unlikely that they would call the store every month for two years. Additionally, the fact that the store told them to keep it suggests that there was no issue with the sofa itself. On the other hand, an extra pillow would not be a significant enough issue to warrant multiple calls to the store, and it is unlikely that the store would tell the customer to keep the sofa if they had made a mistake in giving them an extra pillow."}}
{"Q": "Barry loves playing baseball. Which event could cause Barry decided to leave the game?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Barry wasn't getting any work time. (B) Barry went to the ball park, but it started raining.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Barry went to the ball park, but it started raining.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly affects Barry's ability to play baseball. If it starts raining, the game may be postponed or cancelled, which could cause Barry to leave the game. On the other hand, not getting any work time may be frustrating, but it doesn't necessarily mean that Barry would leave the game altogether."}}
{"Q": "We had ants in our Keurig coffeemaker recently. Which event could cause The ants finally disappeared?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We laid some ant traps to get them away. (B) We called an interior decorator to stop the source of the infestation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. We laid some ant traps to get them away.\nExplanation: Ant traps are designed to attract and kill ants, which would effectively eliminate the ant infestation in the Keurig coffeemaker. Calling an interior decorator would not be a logical solution to an ant problem, as their expertise is in designing and decorating interior spaces, not pest control."}}
{"Q": "Marty always liked Christmas time because she collects angels. Which event could cause To Marty's surprise her son bought the angel to give her as a gift?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a specific angel that she had already owned for quite some time. (B) Marty's son wanted to buy his mom a special gift.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Marty collects angels, it is more plausible that she already owned many angels, including the one her son bought for her. Therefore, it would be a surprise for her to receive a duplicate of an angel she already owned. Marty's son wanting to buy her a special gift is a common occurrence during the holiday season and would not necessarily be a surprise to her."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to make chicken curry. Which event could cause I enjoyed my meal of chicken curry?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I looked online and found a foul chicken curry recipe, then I went to the store and bought the ingredients. (B) I had never tried this recipe before.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If the person had never tried the recipe before, it is possible that they enjoyed the meal of chicken curry. Trying a new recipe can be exciting and if it turns out well, it can be a satisfying experience. On the other hand, if the person had followed a foul recipe, it is unlikely that they would have enjoyed the meal."}}
{"Q": "Sally planted a flower garden. Which event could cause Sally was proud of her creation?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sally ordered what she needed. (B) Sally tended her garden.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sally tended her garden.\nExplanation: Sally's pride in her creation would likely come from seeing the fruits of her labor, which would be the result of tending to her garden. Ordering what she needed may have been a necessary step, but it would not necessarily be the cause of her pride in the garden."}}
{"Q": "Noah had a diaper rash. Which event could cause His rash healed up quickly with some clean air on it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Noah put powder on it. (B) Noah's parents learned that his skin needed to stay in the diaper.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Noah's parents learned that his skin needed to stay in the diaper.\nExplanation: Diaper rash is often caused by prolonged exposure to moisture and friction. Allowing Noah's skin to be exposed to clean air would actually worsen the rash. Therefore, it is more plausible that Noah's parents learned to keep his skin in the diaper to prevent further irritation and promote healing. Applying powder may also help, but it is not as effective as keeping the skin dry and protected."}}
{"Q": "Pam's most hated chore is vacuuming. Which event could cause Now she never has to vacuum?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Pam's mother told her she wouldn't vacuum instead. (B) She recently had back surgery and can no longer vacuum.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Pam's mother told her she wouldn't vacuum instead.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that someone else will take over the chore of vacuuming, relieving Pam of the task. Option (B) suggests that Pam is physically unable to vacuum due to back surgery, which is a less likely scenario as it would be a significant life event and may not necessarily result in someone else taking over the chore."}}
{"Q": "There was a mechanic who didn't pay attention. Which event could cause The customer was angry he didn't pay attention to details?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He messed up a car by not giving it the care it needed. (B) The cook accidentally messed up a paint job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the mechanic didn't pay attention to details, it is more likely that he would mess up a car by not giving it the care it needed, which could cause the customer to be angry. The cook accidentally messing up a paint job is not related to the mechanic's job and would not cause the customer to be angry with the mechanic."}}
{"Q": "Tom thought that football looked fun. Which event could cause He had tons of fun, and made a bunch of new friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom watched a football team. (B) Tom asked some people at the park to play.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Tom asked some people at the park to play.\nExplanation: If Tom only watched a football team, he may have enjoyed the game but would not have had the opportunity to make new friends or actively participate in the sport. However, if he asked some people at the park to play, he would have been able to join in on the game and interact with others, leading to a fun experience and the potential to make new friends."}}
{"Q": "Samantha had a flat tire. Which event could cause His mechanic was able to patch the tire up?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Samantha's boyfriend was the guy for the job.\". (B) Samantha's boyfriend knew a guy for the job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Samantha's boyfriend knew a guy for the job.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Samantha's boyfriend knew someone who could fix the tire rather than being the one to fix it himself. Additionally, the use of the word \"mechanic\" implies that a professional was involved in the repair, rather than an amateur."}}
{"Q": "Sarah rushed home to see her cat in labor Which event could cause Sarah found them loving homes by donating them to her friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sarah loved all the kittens so she kept them. (B) Sarah's cat gave birth to 8 healthy kittens.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Since Sarah's cat gave birth to 8 healthy kittens, it is more plausible that Sarah found them loving homes by donating them to her friends rather than keeping all of them herself. It is common for pet owners to find homes for their pets' offspring, especially if they cannot keep them all."}}
{"Q": "Liz was babysitting a 5 year old boy. Which event could cause Liz got bored of the game and took a nap?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Liz never played board games with him. (B) Liz decided to play a board game with the boy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Liz decided to play a board game with the boy, it is possible that the game was not engaging enough for her and she got bored. However, if Liz never played board games with him, it is unlikely that she would suddenly decide to take a nap during their time together."}}
{"Q": "Tanya wanted to mount both of her degrees on her wall. Which event could cause Tanya's internet start-up manager stopped her from hanging them?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tanya decided to put nails in the wall. (B) Tanya's boss didn't allow clutter on the walls.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tanya's boss didn't allow clutter on the walls.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tanya's boss has a policy against clutter on the walls rather than stopping her from putting nails in the wall. Additionally, Tanya could have used other methods to hang her degrees without using nails, such as using adhesive strips or a hanging wire. Therefore, it is more likely that Tanya's boss did not allow her to hang her degrees due to a policy against clutter on the walls."}}
{"Q": "Joey was a second grader that like to color in coloring books. Which event could cause Joey felt proud of himself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joey mis-colored the picture. (B) Joey colored in 20 books.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Joey colored in 20 books.\nExplanation: Joey would feel proud of himself if he accomplished a goal or achieved something that he worked hard for. Coloring in 20 books would be a significant accomplishment for a second grader and would require dedication and effort. On the other hand, mis-coloring a picture would likely make Joey feel disappointed or frustrated with himself."}}
{"Q": "Jason woke up and went to prepare his daily cereal for breakfast. Which event could cause He compromised and ate his cereal dry?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When he stared pouring the milk he caught a nasty smell, the mild was sour. (B) Jason incompleted he was out of milk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Jason realized he was out of milk, it would be more plausible for him to compromise and eat his cereal dry rather than risk eating spoiled milk."}}
{"Q": "Marcia went to a new hairdresser to get her hair done. Which event could cause She immediately went to her old hairdresser to get it fixed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Marica did not like the way her clothes turned out today. (B) Marcia got an awful haircut.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Marcia got an awful haircut.\nExplanation: This is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the service she received from the new hairdresser. If Marcia got an awful haircut, it would make sense for her to immediately go to her old hairdresser to get it fixed. Option (A) about not liking her clothes has no relation to her hair and would not be a reason for her to go to her old hairdresser."}}
{"Q": "Jacob was eager for the upcoming science fair. Which event could cause Jacob's efforts paid off when he took home the first place ribbon?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jacob made a small scale wind turbine farm. (B) Jacob prepared lazily all week.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jacob made a small scale wind turbine farm.\nExplanation: Jacob's eagerness for the science fair suggests that he put in a lot of effort and preparation. Making a small scale wind turbine farm is a complex and impressive project that would require a lot of research, planning, and execution. If Jacob put in the necessary effort and did a good job on his project, it is plausible that he could win first place at the science fair. On the other hand, preparing lazily all week (option B) is unlikely to result in a first place ribbon."}}
{"Q": "Rick received a mysterious package in his mailbox. Which event could cause It was a surprise gift from his grandmother for his birthday?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rick was not sure what the individual was. (B) Rick opened and saw who the box was from.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Rick saw who the box was from, then it is more likely that he would recognize it as a gift from his grandmother for his birthday. Option A suggests that Rick did not know who the sender was, which would make it less likely that it was a surprise gift from his grandmother."}}
{"Q": "John was very nervous about his upcoming flight. Which event could cause John had no problem with his flight after he took his pill?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John was hesitant to take medication for anxiety. (B) He decided to take a pill.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If John took a pill to calm his nerves, it is likely that the medication helped him relax and feel more comfortable during the flight. Therefore, he would have had no problem with his flight after taking the pill. Option A does not provide a clear reason for why John would suddenly have no problem with his flight."}}
{"Q": "Carlton hated to get rid of his encyclopedia set. Which event could cause He happily took them home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He thought he might need them. (B) His best friend gave them to Carlton.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He thought he might need them.\nExplanation: Carlton's initial feeling towards his encyclopedia set was that he hated to get rid of them, indicating that he valued them in some way. If he thought he might need them in the future, it would make sense for him to happily take them home instead of getting rid of them. On the other hand, if his best friend gave them to him, it wouldn't necessarily change his initial feeling of not wanting to get rid of them."}}
{"Q": "Amy wanted to meet Cinderella. Which event could cause Cinderella hugged Amy as her family took pictures?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy's mom found a dress up Cinderella or Amy to see. (B) Amy's family made her dream come true by taking her to florida.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Amy's family made her dream come true by taking her to Florida.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Cinderella would hug Amy if she was actually at Disney World in Florida where Cinderella's castle is located and where she is known to make appearances. It is less likely that a dress up Cinderella would hug Amy just for seeing a dress up version of herself. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely event that would lead to Cinderella hugging Amy."}}
{"Q": "Gina was so excited for prom. Which event could cause Finally it was prom night, and Gina was so happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina brought a new dress and candles. (B) Gina got a date.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Gina got a date.\nExplanation: Getting a date for prom is a significant event for many high school students, and it can cause a lot of excitement and anticipation. It is a more plausible event that would cause Gina to be happy and excited for prom night. While buying a new dress and candles can also be exciting, it is not as significant as having a date for prom."}}
{"Q": "Cassidy was riding her bike. Which event could cause It turned out that her arm was broken?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She fell when she went under a rock and hurt her arm. (B) Cassidy fell and thought she was only scraped.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Falling when going under a rock is a more plausible event that could cause a broken arm compared to just falling and thinking she was only scraped. The impact of hitting a rock could cause more severe injuries, including a broken arm."}}
{"Q": "Alicia wanted to check out the ice cream shop nearby. Which event could cause She ended up getting many pints?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Alicia wanted a lot of ice cream. (B) Alicia was impressed by the one flavor the ice cream shop had.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Alicia wanted a lot of ice cream.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Alicia ended up getting many pints because she wanted a lot of ice cream, rather than being impressed by just one flavor. If she wanted a lot of ice cream, she would naturally end up getting many pints. On the other hand, if she was impressed by just one flavor, she might have just gotten one or two pints of that flavor."}}
{"Q": "I finally got around to watching the movie Deadpool. Which event could cause I just enjoyed the gratuitous violence and excessive profanity?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was very illicit. (B) I didn't think I was going to like it at all.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I didn't think I was going to like it at all.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because the movie Deadpool is known for its excessive violence and profanity, so it is not surprising that someone might enjoy it for those reasons. However, if someone didn't think they were going to like it at all, but ended up enjoying it, it could be because they were pleasantly surprised by the humor and wit of the film, as well as the unique storytelling style. The unexpected enjoyment of the movie could have led to a greater appreciation of the violence and profanity as part of the overall experience."}}
{"Q": "Melissa invited Mark to the park for a picnic. Which event could cause Melissa and Mark spent all day talking and sharing food?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was a nice day, so Melissa and Mark stayed at the park. (B) Mark said he had other plans to Melissa.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If it was a nice day, Melissa and Mark would be more likely to want to stay at the park and enjoy the weather. If Mark had other plans, it would be less likely that they would spend all day talking and sharing food at the park."}}
{"Q": "Mike was sitting at his desk. Which event could cause Mike had a stroke?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mike was eating greasy french fries. (B) He had been working at his desk for well over a month.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mike was eating greasy french fries.\nExplanation: Eating a diet high in saturated and trans fats, such as greasy french fries, can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol, both of which are risk factors for stroke. While working at a desk for long periods of time can also increase the risk of stroke, it is less likely to cause an immediate stroke compared to consuming a high-fat diet."}}
{"Q": "Tom and Sally went to the beach. Which event could cause Tom eventually build an incredible sand castle and impressed Sally?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom wanted to surf with Sally in the waves. (B) Tom wasn't sure if Sally liked him very much.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom wasn't sure if Sally liked him very much.\nExplanation: If Tom wasn't sure if Sally liked him very much, he may have tried to impress her by building an incredible sand castle. This is a more plausible answer than (A) because wanting to surf with Sally in the waves doesn't necessarily have anything to do with building a sand castle."}}
{"Q": "Larry has decided to help out his friends prepare for a party. Which event could cause Larry was happy that he could contribute to the party?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He put in half of his pay check. (B) They all had trouble cooking and decorating before the rest of the guests arrived.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Larry would be happy to contribute by helping his friends with cooking and decorating, as it shows his willingness to lend a hand and be a part of the party preparations. While putting in half of his paycheck is a generous gesture, it may not necessarily bring him happiness or satisfaction in the same way as actively participating in the party preparations."}}
{"Q": "Four Outlaws camped in Blood Gulch. Which event could cause He arrested them?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They found where the sheriff was. (B) The sheriff found where they were.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The sheriff found where they were.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the sheriff would find the outlaws' campsite rather than the outlaws finding the sheriff's location. The sheriff would likely be actively searching for the outlaws and would have resources and information to track them down. On the other hand, the outlaws would have to rely on luck or insider information to find the sheriff's location. Therefore, it is more likely that the sheriff found the outlaws' campsite and arrested them."}}
{"Q": "Mary woke up in the morning with a terrible pain in her mouth. Which event could cause Discomfort aside, Mary left very relieved and drove home to rest?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary went to the drug dealer to help her toothache. (B) She went to the dentist and said she would be fine and to take some medicine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary went to the dentist to seek professional help for her toothache. The dentist would have been able to diagnose the cause of the pain and provide appropriate treatment, such as medication or a dental procedure. Going to a drug dealer would not have provided a long-term solution and could have potentially made the situation worse. Additionally, if Mary received treatment from the dentist, it is likely that she would feel relieved and able to rest at home afterwards."}}
{"Q": "My son encouraged me to read the Game of Thrones books. Which event could cause I told my son I was not interested in reading the other four books?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I decided to humor him and managed to get through the first book. (B) I watched the first book and did not like it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Since the prompt states that the son encouraged the mother to read the books, it is more likely that the mother would try to humor her son and read the first book. If she did not like it, she may have decided not to continue reading the other four books. However, if she had watched the first book (which is not possible since it is a book and not a movie or TV show), it would not have been a valid reason for not wanting to read the other books."}}
{"Q": "Joey was a second grader that like to color in coloring books. Which event could cause Joey wished his parent's appreciated him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He always gave his finished pictures to his parents and they would hang each one on the refrigerator. (B) Joey's parents didn't seem to be impressed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Joey's parents didn't seem to be impressed with his coloring, it could make him feel like his efforts were not appreciated. This could lead him to wish that his parents appreciated him more. On the other hand, if his parents always hung his pictures on the refrigerator, it would likely make him feel appreciated and valued. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "In 2009 my wife wanted to see the Christmas lights on Boston Common. Which event could cause The lights put her into a festive mood?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My wife saw the lights and decided it was time to get Christmas lights of our own. (B) My wife always went to go to church with her family.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Seeing the Christmas lights on Boston Common is a festive and joyful experience that can put anyone in the holiday spirit. It is likely that my wife was inspired by the beautiful display and wanted to bring some of that festive cheer into our own home by getting Christmas lights of our own. Going to church with her family is not directly related to the Christmas lights on Boston Common and therefore is not as plausible of an answer."}}
{"Q": "Susan met a nice prince on the Internet. Which event could cause Susan still hopes her prince will find her again someday?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Susan and her prince got married. (B) The prince stopped talking to Susan.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The prince stopped talking to Susan.\nExplanation: If Susan and her prince got married, it would mean that they found each other again and there would be no reason for her to hope for him to find her again someday. However, if the prince stopped talking to Susan, it could mean that there was a misunderstanding or some other reason for the communication to stop. In this case, Susan may still hold onto the hope that her prince will reach out to her again in the future."}}
{"Q": "Brian's wife had 100 pairs of shoes. Which event could cause Pam and Brian have since gotten divorced?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Brian did not stop loving Pam. (B) Brian told Pam that she needed to control her spending.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Brian told Pam that she needed to control her spending.\nExplanation: This event could cause conflict in their relationship if Pam felt that Brian was trying to control her or limit her freedom. If Pam was very attached to her shoe collection and felt that Brian was criticizing her for it, it could lead to resentment and ultimately contribute to the breakdown of their marriage."}}
{"Q": "Tom wanted to start a garden in his backyard. Which event could cause Now his plants are starting to grow different fruits?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He used a raised bed with fertilizer. (B) Tom decided to plant vegetables.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Using a raised bed with fertilizer can provide the plants with optimal growing conditions, which can lead to healthier and more productive plants. The use of fertilizer can also provide the necessary nutrients for the plants to produce different fruits. On the other hand, simply deciding to plant vegetables may not necessarily cause the plants to produce different fruits."}}
{"Q": "Phil lived a normal life, until one day he experienced kidney failure. Which event could cause Phil's life was saved, and he was very thankful to the donor?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Phil got a replacement knee. (B) He went on the transplant list and received a call that he had a match.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Kidney failure requires a kidney transplant to save the patient's life. Therefore, the most plausible event that could have saved Phil's life and made him thankful to the donor is receiving a call that he had a match and getting a kidney transplant. Option A, getting a replacement knee, is not relevant to Phil's kidney failure and would not have saved his life."}}
{"Q": "Roz was thrilled when her boyfriend gave her a ring. Which event could cause Then she began doubting her boyfriend's love?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A friend then told Roz he was cheating. (B) Roz then cheated on her boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Roz's friend told her that her boyfriend was cheating, it would be a plausible reason for her to doubt his love. On the other hand, if Roz cheated on her boyfriend, it would not be a justifiable reason for her to doubt his love."}}
{"Q": "Tom had a pet toad. Which event could cause Unfortunately, Jimmy's snake got to Tom's toad before he could?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom lost his toad while visiting his friend Jimmy. (B) one day Jimmy brought his dog over to Tom's and let it loose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom lost his toad while visiting his friend Jimmy.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it directly involves Jimmy's snake, which could have easily gotten to Tom's toad while they were visiting. Option B involves Jimmy's dog, which may not have been interested in the toad and may not have been able to get to it if it was kept in a secure location."}}
{"Q": "Allison cannot stand the taste of broccoli. Which event could cause Allison's father gives her another helping of broccoli on her plate?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) But she had a bad cold, so she ate some. (B) But Allison felt amazing, so she ate some.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Allison had a bad cold, her sense of taste may be compromised, making the taste of broccoli less unpleasant. Therefore, her father may give her another helping of broccoli on her plate. On the other hand, if Allison felt amazing, it is unlikely that she would suddenly want to eat broccoli, especially if she cannot stand the taste of it."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was trying to complete tasks for her boss. Which event could cause Kelly decided it was best to stick with what her boss told her to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly wanted to do the tasks her  boss's way. (B) Kelly had an idea to streamline the process.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Kelly's desire to do the tasks her boss's way is a more plausible reason for her to stick with what her boss told her to do. It shows that Kelly values her boss's input and wants to follow their instructions to ensure that the tasks are completed correctly. On the other hand, having an idea to streamline the process may cause Kelly to deviate from her boss's instructions, as she may believe that her idea is better. However, this may not always be the case, and it could lead to mistakes or delays in completing the tasks."}}
{"Q": "Ana and her mom went to the toy store. Which event could cause Finally, she picked out a pink teddy bear?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ana's mom said she cannot pick out her own gift today. (B) Ana faced a store of impossible choices.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Ana saw a pink teddy bear that she really liked and decided to choose it as her toy. \nExplanation: This is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to Ana's decision to pick out a pink teddy bear. The other option (A) suggests that Ana's mom had a say in her toy selection, which is not mentioned in the question. Option (B) suggests that Ana had difficulty choosing a toy, but there is no indication of this in the question."}}
{"Q": "Tim was throwing a dinner party. Which event could cause He still offered them drinks, though?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim's friends said they were not thirsty. (B) Tim's guests had already eaten drinks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tim's guests had already eaten drinks.\nExplanation: If Tim's guests had already eaten drinks, it means they had already consumed some form of liquid, possibly water or juice. However, Tim still offered them drinks, which could mean alcoholic beverages or other types of drinks. This shows that Tim was a gracious host who wanted to make sure his guests were comfortable and had everything they needed, even if they had already consumed some form of liquid. On the other hand, if Tim's friends said they were not thirsty, it would not make sense for him to offer them drinks anyway, as it would be unnecessary and potentially wasteful."}}
{"Q": "Lenny wanted to watch a movie. Which event could cause He went back home and binge watched all of his movies?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lenny found a good movie on Netflix at home. (B) There was nothing he wanted to see at the theater.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There was nothing he wanted to see at the theater.\nExplanation: If Lenny couldn't find a movie he wanted to watch at the theater, he may have decided to go back home and watch movies he already owns. This is a more plausible answer than finding a good movie on Netflix at home, as Lenny may not have a Netflix subscription or may not have found a movie he wanted to watch on the platform."}}
{"Q": "Janes dog died last week. Which event could cause She spent a few hours with us to help her forget missing her dog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Janes's aunt came over to see her. (B) Jane felt really neutral about it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Jane's aunt came over to see her.\nExplanation: Jane's aunt coming over to see her could provide a distraction and emotional support for Jane, which could help her forget about missing her dog for a few hours. Option B, Jane feeling neutral about her dog's death, does not provide a reason for her to want to forget about missing her dog."}}
{"Q": "Max hated doing homework. Which event could cause She sent a note to his parents explaining what he'd done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Max didn't turn in his homework to his teacher. (B) Max decided to run away from home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Max didn't turn in his homework to his teacher.\nExplanation: If Max didn't turn in his homework, his teacher would likely contact his parents to inform them of his lack of effort. This could prompt his parents to send a note to Max's teacher, explaining why he didn't turn in his homework and potentially leading to consequences at home. Running away from home is a drastic event that is unlikely to be caused by simply hating homework."}}
{"Q": "Jack bought a new book yesterday. Which event could cause Jack wished he had placed his book in a better spot?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack's book was stolen off the counter. (B) He left it inside and it got rained on.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He left it inside and it got rained on.\nExplanation: If Jack left his book inside and it got rained on, he would regret not placing it in a better spot to avoid water damage. On the other hand, if his book was stolen off the counter, it would not be a result of his placement and he would not necessarily wish he had placed it in a better spot. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Anthony wanted to learn how to speak Spanish. Which event could cause Anthony could not get the language down properly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Instead of going to the beach Anthony studied Spanish. (B) Anthony took a Spanish class but struggled.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Anthony took a Spanish class but struggled.\nExplanation: Even though Anthony made an effort to learn Spanish by taking a class, he may have struggled with the language due to various reasons such as difficulty in understanding the grammar, lack of practice, or not being able to grasp the pronunciation. This could hinder his ability to speak Spanish properly. On the other hand, studying Spanish instead of going to the beach (option A) could actually help Anthony learn the language better as he would have more time to focus on it."}}
{"Q": "I came home from work and was very hungry. Which event could cause I cooked the pasta and enjoyed it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) i prepared a dish for myself to eat. (B) I found the food cabinet to be empty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer because it suggests that the person took action to satisfy their hunger by preparing a dish for themselves. Option B suggests that there was no food available, which would make it impossible for the person to cook pasta and enjoy it."}}
{"Q": "Naomi turned 15 on Thursday. Which event could cause Naomi had a wonderful birthday?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her parents gave her a great surprize pizza party. (B) Naomi got to meet the president at her dream.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Naomi had a wonderful birthday because her parents gave her a great surprise pizza party. Meeting the president is a rare and unlikely event, whereas a surprise party from her parents is a more common and realistic way to make a birthday special."}}
{"Q": "Gina's brother was in trouble. Which event could cause He was in big trouble, and Gina loved every minute of it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Usually Gina is the one getting him in trouble. (B) ginas brother had broken her moms expensive chair.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Gina's brother is in trouble due to his own actions, and Gina may be enjoying the role reversal of him being the one in trouble instead of her. Option B suggests that Gina's brother has caused damage to their mother's property, which is unlikely to bring Gina any joy or amusement."}}
{"Q": "Emily's grandfather often did something strange. Which event could cause If it was tails up, he'd leave it where it was?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One day grandfather found a cat on the sidewalk. (B) Emily's grandfather collected pennies found head up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Emily's grandfather collected pennies found head up, it would make sense for him to leave a coin where it was if it was tails up, as it would not be considered lucky. This behavior aligns with the superstition that finding a penny with the head side up brings good luck. On the other hand, finding a cat on the sidewalk does not seem to have any connection to leaving a coin tails up."}}
{"Q": "Judy was going to see a movie. Which event could cause Finally, she decided to just see a different movie?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The movie Judy wanted to see what sold out. (B) Judy had to break line for the one she wanted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the movie Judy wanted to see was sold out, she would have no choice but to see a different movie. Breaking line would not necessarily cause her to change her movie choice."}}
{"Q": "Tom told Jenny a secret. Which event could cause Tom became upset with Jenny?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom posted about her secret on his blog. (B) Jenny ignored him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Tom would likely become upset with Jenny if she shared his secret without his permission, especially if she did so publicly on a blog. This would be a breach of trust and could have negative consequences for Tom. On the other hand, Jenny ignoring him may not necessarily be related to the secret and may not cause him to become upset with her."}}
{"Q": "Jake went to a walmart. Which event could cause He felt relieved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was ready to pay and thought he had lost his car keys, he finally found it in his pocket instead of his coat. (B) He was ready to pay and thought he had lost his debit card, he finally found it in his pocket instead of his wallet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Losing car keys can be a more stressful situation than losing a debit card as it can cause inconvenience and delay in leaving the store. Finding the keys in his pocket instead of his coat would have relieved Jake's stress and anxiety."}}
{"Q": "The giant box containing my new reel mower had arrived. Which event could cause It works wonderfully and easily?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I pushed the wheelbarrow across the backyard. (B) I like my new mower.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The event that could cause the new reel mower to work wonderfully and easily is liking the new mower. This is because if someone likes their new mower, they are more likely to take care of it and use it properly, leading to better performance. Pushing a wheelbarrow across the backyard has no direct correlation to the performance of the mower."}}
{"Q": "Charlie loved to play catch with his dad. Which event could cause He made the team and made sure to bring his glove to practice?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So to make his Dad happy he tried out for the baseball team. (B) Charlie's dad told him to try out for the football team.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The sentence states that Charlie loved to play catch with his dad, indicating that he has an interest in baseball. Therefore, it is more plausible that he tried out for the baseball team to continue playing the sport he enjoys with his dad. Choice B, where his dad tells him to try out for the football team, is not supported by any information in the sentence and seems unlikely."}}
{"Q": "Kyle collected many things. Which event could cause Kyle thought Superman was a ridiculous construct?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kyle did not like Supergirl. (B) Kyle did not like Superman.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Kyle collected many things, it is likely that he was a fan of various fictional characters. Therefore, it is more plausible that Kyle did not like Superman specifically, rather than disliking Supergirl, which is a separate character. This dislike could have led him to think that Superman was a ridiculous construct."}}
{"Q": "My teacher dismissed the class early since she had to leave. Which event could cause When I found it, all of my money was gone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I left my lunch bag at home. (B) I had left my wallet in the classroom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I had left my wallet in the classroom.\nExplanation: Since the teacher dismissed the class early, it is likely that the student did not have enough time to retrieve their wallet from the classroom before leaving. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student's money was gone because they left their wallet in the classroom rather than because they left their lunch bag at home."}}
{"Q": "Tom was playing baseball during lunch time. Which event could cause But he used it as an excuse to play another position?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He told the coach that no one else could play his position. (B) Tom didn't enjoy playing outfield and claimed he couldn't see.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Tom claiming he couldn't see while playing outfield is a more plausible reason for him to switch positions than telling the coach that no one else could play his position. It is common for players to have preferences for certain positions and if Tom didn't enjoy playing outfield, it would make sense for him to use his vision as an excuse to switch to a different position."}}
{"Q": "Taylor struggled with math class. Which event could cause Taylor got a B+ on her test?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Taylor studied but all of the concepts didn't make any sense to her. (B) She studied real hard with a straight A student.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She studied real hard with a straight A student.\nExplanation: If Taylor studied with a straight A student, it is likely that the student was able to explain the concepts in a way that made sense to Taylor. This would increase her understanding and improve her performance on the test. On the other hand, if Taylor studied on her own and the concepts didn't make sense to her, it is less likely that she would have been able to improve her grade."}}
{"Q": "Mia went to the zoo on a field trip with her class. Which event could cause Mia decided that the lion was her favorite animal?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mia didn't see the animals at the zoo. (B) Mia loved all the animals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (C) Mia was fascinated by the lion's roar and behavior.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Mia would have a favorite animal based on a specific experience or observation, rather than simply loving all the animals or not seeing them at all. The lion's roar and behavior are unique and captivating, which could have caught Mia's attention and made her decide that it was her favorite animal."}}
{"Q": "My sister's dog Olga was laying on the couch. Which event could cause She just lay down right on top of him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She moved Olga to his dog bed. (B) My sister sat down on the couch by Olga.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) My sister sat down on the couch by Olga.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Olga was already on the couch and my sister sat down next to her, causing her to lay down on top of the dog. It is less likely that my sister would move Olga to his dog bed and then lay down on the couch herself."}}
{"Q": "Judy took her kids to the zoo. Which event could cause They could not wait to go back to the zoo?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Judy's nieces had a good time at the zoo. (B) judy's kids played with a lion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Judy's nieces had a good time at the zoo.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Judy's kids would want to go back to the zoo if they saw other children having a good time there, rather than if they played with a dangerous animal like a lion. Additionally, playing with a lion is not a safe or realistic scenario at a zoo. Therefore, option A is the more likely event that would make Judy's kids want to go back to the zoo."}}
{"Q": "I wanted Italian food. Which event could cause Alas, I ruined the cream base so the dish tasted terrible?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She decided to make alfredo sauce. (B) I tried a new recipe and followed the steps closely.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Alfredo sauce is a classic Italian sauce that requires a cream base. If the cream base is ruined, it can easily ruin the dish and make it taste terrible. Therefore, it is more plausible that the event causing the ruined dish was the decision to make alfredo sauce. Option B does not provide any indication that the dish being made was Italian, and trying a new recipe does not necessarily mean that the cream base was ruined."}}
{"Q": "Last year my uncle bought a metal detector. Which event could cause My uncle enjoys his hobby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He spends all morning walking up and down the beach enjoying the weather. (B) He spends all morning walking up and down the beach yelling at people.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) He spends all morning walking up and down the beach enjoying the weather.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that my uncle would enjoy his hobby by spending time outdoors and enjoying the weather while using his metal detector. Yelling at people would not only be rude and inappropriate, but it would also not be a productive or enjoyable use of his time with the metal detector."}}
{"Q": "Finley realized it was the day before her husband's birthday. Which event could cause Overnight delivery got the package to the house on time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She got him a great gift online last week. (B) She ordered him new golf clubs online.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Finley ordered new golf clubs online for her husband's birthday, it is likely that she would want them to arrive on time for his special day. Therefore, she may have opted for overnight delivery to ensure that the package arrived on time. In contrast, option A does not necessarily indicate a need for urgent delivery, as the gift may have already arrived or could potentially arrive after the birthday."}}
{"Q": "Ken enjoys running. Which event could cause He threw all of his attention into knitting, and he became happy agai?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ken fell and broke a flower so they took up a new hobby. (B) Ken got tired of running.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Ken enjoys running, it is unlikely that he would suddenly give it up for knitting just because he broke a flower. However, it is plausible that he may have gotten tired of running and decided to try a new hobby, such as knitting, which made him happy again."}}
{"Q": "Dan and Rob were playing in the back yard. Which event could cause Dan got in trouble for trampling the neighbors flowers?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rob threw the ball into the neighbor's yard and Dan ran to get it. (B) The neighbors ran through Dan's flowers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it involves Dan actively running towards the neighbor's yard, while option B involves the neighbors running through Dan's flowers, which is not mentioned as a possibility in the question. Additionally, option A involves a direct cause-and-effect relationship between Dan's actions and the trampling of the neighbor's flowers."}}
{"Q": "Jane had a pet bird. Which event could cause Jane's friend forgot to feed it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jane lets her friend cook the bird. (B) Jane noticed there was food in the cage.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jane noticed there was food in the cage.\nExplanation: If Jane noticed there was food in the cage, it is more likely that she would assume her friend had already fed the bird and not remind them to do so. However, if Jane let her friend cook the bird (choice A), it would be a deliberate and cruel act, which is unlikely to happen."}}
{"Q": "Jackson has always wanted to play the bass guitar. Which event could cause Finally jackson is able to play bass guitar?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jackson took piano lessons. (B) the bass guitar team selected jackson.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The bass guitar team selected Jackson.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that Jackson has been practicing and improving his bass guitar skills, and has caught the attention of the bass guitar team. Being selected for the team would give Jackson the opportunity to finally play the bass guitar, as well as the motivation to continue practicing and improving his skills. Taking piano lessons may not necessarily lead to Jackson being able to play the bass guitar, as they are different instruments with different techniques and skills required."}}
{"Q": "My niece was scared of most characters at Disney. Which event could cause She said she was her favorite?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My loved Snow White, however. (B) My niece found Aladdin and liked him a lot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since the question states that the niece was scared of most characters at Disney, it is more plausible that she found one character she liked a lot (Aladdin) rather than suddenly changing her mind about a character she was previously scared of (Snow White)."}}
{"Q": "Alan got a gun for his 18th birthday. Which event could cause He now loves to go hunting?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His dad took him hunting. (B) Alan decided to go hunting.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that Alan's interest in hunting was sparked by his dad taking him hunting, as he may have enjoyed the experience and wanted to continue it. It is less likely that he randomly decided to go hunting without any prior exposure or interest in the activity."}}
{"Q": "Janet had been working at her company for several Year's. Which event could cause However, eventually they came to an understanding and became friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Janet started dating one of her co-workers. (B) She and her husband often had arguments.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Janet started dating one of her co-workers.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Janet started dating one of her co-workers and initially had some conflicts with them, but eventually, they came to an understanding and became friends. This is a common scenario in workplaces where co-workers start dating and face some initial challenges in their relationship. On the other hand, her personal life with her husband's arguments is not directly related to her work and is less likely to cause her to become friends with a co-worker."}}
{"Q": "Tom was preparing for a business trip. Which event could cause This person helped to calm Tom down, and Tom enjoyed the flight?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom had a panic attack on his business trip flight. (B) Tom is interested in airplanes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: This person helped to calm Tom down, and Tom enjoyed the flight.\nExplanation: This is the most plausible answer as it suggests that Tom was anxious or nervous about the flight, but someone was able to help him calm down and enjoy the experience. This is a common scenario for many people who may experience anxiety or fear of flying, and having someone to support and reassure them can make a big difference in their overall experience. Option B is not relevant to the situation and does not explain why Tom would have enjoyed the flight. Option A is also possible, but it is less likely as it suggests that Tom had a panic attack, which is a more extreme reaction than just feeling nervous or anxious."}}
{"Q": "At age nine, Abby moved to a new neighborhood where she knew no one. Which event could cause That dog walked beside Abby all the way through her high school years?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) her parents got her a dog that became her best friend. (B) Every day, Abby's dog watched her walk to school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Abby's parents got her a dog that became her best friend, rather than a random dog following her every day for years. It is common for children to form strong bonds with their pets, especially when they are in a new environment and have no friends. The dog could have provided comfort and companionship for Abby throughout her high school years."}}
{"Q": "Tim was on vacation. Which event could cause He decided to leave and go home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A party was headed for Tim's area. (B) But he wants to meet his family members.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tim wanting to meet his family members is a more plausible reason for him to leave and go home while on vacation. A party headed for his area may not necessarily be a reason for him to cut his vacation short and go home."}}
{"Q": "Jim's dad was getting up in years, turning ninety. Which event could cause When Jim's dad passed away, Jim felt so good about what he had done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim made sure he spend a lot of time with his dad. (B) He decided to have an extra special mothers day that year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Spending a lot of time with his dad before he passed away would likely bring Jim a sense of comfort and satisfaction, as he would have been able to cherish those final moments with his father. On the other hand, having an extra special Mother's Day would not necessarily be related to Jim's feelings after his father's passing."}}
{"Q": "Joe used to own two dogs. Which event could cause Now, he seems happy with just one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) one of them passed away from old age. (B) One of them lived to old age.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) one of them passed away from old age.\nExplanation: Losing a pet can be a difficult and emotional experience, and it is not uncommon for pet owners to choose not to get another pet after the loss of one. It is more plausible that Joe's decision to have only one dog now is due to the passing of his other dog rather than the remaining dog living to old age."}}
{"Q": "Andre was kicking flowers in the yard. Which event could cause He never ignored a warning ever again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His father warned him. (B) He ignored the sign and got stung by a bee.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He ignored the sign and got stung by a bee.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly relates to the consequences of ignoring a warning. Kicking flowers in the yard may not necessarily lead to a warning, but ignoring a warning and getting stung by a bee could be a painful and memorable experience that would make Andre think twice before ignoring warnings in the future."}}
{"Q": "Amy and Beth were best friends. Which event could cause Amy slapped Beth when she made it seem like it was no big deal?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Beth betrayed Amy and did not seem to care. (B) Beth confessed that she slept with her own boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Betrayal is a serious offense in any friendship, and if Beth betrayed Amy and did not seem to care, it could have caused Amy to react with anger and frustration. On the other hand, Beth confessing to sleeping with her own boyfriend may not necessarily be a reason for Amy to slap her, as it does not directly involve Amy or their friendship."}}
{"Q": "Anna heard a weird noise from her car. Which event could cause He said Anna's car would only cost $90 to fix?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna kicked her car. (B) Anna took the car to the mechanic to see what was wrong.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anna took her car to the mechanic to see what was wrong, as this is a common action when a strange noise is heard from a car. Kicking a car is unlikely to cause a specific issue that would only cost $90 to fix."}}
{"Q": "After finishing my homework, I started to exercise. Which event could cause Since it was 12 in the afternoon, I decided to skip school?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was supposed to be at school but was running late. (B) I exercised for a few hours and then went to school without setting my alarm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If it was already 12 in the afternoon, it is unlikely that someone would skip school without a valid reason. Being late for school is a more plausible reason for missing it. Additionally, the fact that the person finished their homework and started exercising suggests that they had intentions of going to school before something caused them to change their plans."}}
{"Q": "Melissa never drank wine. Which event could cause Melissa started drinking wine every night?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Melissa had one glass at dinner and loved it. (B) Valerie decided to try it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Melissa tried wine for the first time and enjoyed it, leading her to start drinking it every night. The fact that Valerie decided to try it does not necessarily mean that Melissa would also start drinking it every night."}}
{"Q": "I looked over at the teenager and asked her to quiet down. Which event could cause Sadly, I had to tell her not to come if she could not listen?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The teenager scoffed and kept being loud. (B) The teenager still would not climb down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The teenager scoffed and kept being loud.\nExplanation: If the teenager continued to be loud and disrespectful after being asked to quiet down, it would be reasonable for the speaker to tell her not to come if she couldn't listen. Option B, where the teenager still wouldn't climb down, doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence and doesn't seem to be related to the issue of being loud and disrespectful."}}
{"Q": "Bob discovered his truck had a flat tire. Which event could cause Bob called someone to fix his flat tire?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He didn't know how to fix it himself. (B) Bob called someone to fix his trucks flat tire.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Bob called someone to fix his flat tire because he didn't know how to fix it himself. If he knew how to fix it, he would have done it himself instead of calling someone else."}}
{"Q": "Shawn raised fish for fun. Which event could cause Shawn was sad, but grew to love the growing carnivore?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) But Shawn put a carnivorous fish in with them and the fish ate all the others. (B) A piranha nurtured Shawn's favorite rainbow fish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because introducing a carnivorous fish to a tank with other fish is a common mistake made by inexperienced fish owners. It is also a realistic scenario that could cause Shawn to be initially sad but eventually learn to appreciate the carnivorous fish. Option B, on the other hand, is less likely as piranhas are known to be aggressive and would not typically nurture other fish."}}
{"Q": "Last year my uncle bought a metal detector. Which event could cause My uncle hates the beach?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He realized he doesn't want to use it anywhere but the beach. (B) He set it down to examine something and someone ran off with it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since the metal detector was purchased specifically by the uncle, it is unlikely that someone would run off with it while he was using it. Therefore, option B is less plausible. On the other hand, if the uncle hates the beach, he may have realized that he doesn't want to use the metal detector there and may have lost interest in it altogether. Hence, option A is a more likely event that could cause the uncle to hate the beach."}}
{"Q": "Olivia has a physics test tomorrow. Which event could cause Unfortunately, she falls asleep in the morning and misses the test?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Olivia fell asleep early being tired from studying. (B) Olivia stayed up all night to study.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Olivia stayed up all night to study.\nExplanation: Staying up all night to study is a common behavior among students, especially before an important test. It can lead to exhaustion and oversleeping, which could cause Olivia to miss her physics test. While it is possible that Olivia fell asleep early due to exhaustion from studying, it is less likely to cause her to miss the test as she would have had more time to sleep and wake up in the morning."}}
{"Q": "In the hot summer months nothing soothes Tam's thirst like green tea. Which event could cause For Tam nothing beats a hot day and a cold glass of iced mango heaven?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tam buys plenty of problems. (B) Tam had a cold glass of tea.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tam had a cold glass of tea.\nExplanation: The statement mentions that green tea soothes Tam's thirst in the hot summer months, indicating that Tam prefers cold drinks during this season. Therefore, it is plausible that Tam would enjoy a cold glass of iced mango heaven on a hot day, as it would provide a refreshing and cooling effect. Choice (A) is not related to the statement and does not provide a logical explanation for Tam's preference for iced mango heaven."}}
{"Q": "Sarah was diagnosed with cancer 4 Years ago. Which event could cause She was cancer free?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sarah's nephew had a follow up cancer screening. (B) Sarrah went for sdpecialised medical care.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B, Sarah going for specialized medical care, is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Sarah received treatment for her cancer, which could have led to her being cancer-free. Option A, Sarah's nephew having a follow-up cancer screening, is not directly related to Sarah's cancer diagnosis and treatment, so it is less likely to be the cause of her being cancer-free."}}
{"Q": "Greg never thought he'd boo-boo on himself. Which event could cause One party goer thought the house pet used the bathroom on the floor?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Greg made a mess at a party. (B) Greg ate something to calm his stomach.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Greg ate something to calm his stomach, it is possible that it did not agree with him and caused him to have an accident. This would be a more plausible explanation for the party goer's observation than Greg simply making a mess at the party."}}
{"Q": "My parents came from China. Which event could cause He bought candy Year's later when he learned about Halloween?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My uncle camee to visit last year on Christmas. (B) They did not know our customs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They did not know our customs.\nExplanation: Since the parents came from China, it is possible that they were not familiar with the American holiday of Halloween and its customs, such as trick-or-treating and buying candy. Therefore, it is more plausible that the reason for buying candy years later was due to a lack of knowledge about the holiday rather than a visit from an uncle on Christmas."}}
{"Q": "John was training for a marathon. Which event could cause On the day of the race, he finished in record time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) John trained day and night and worked very hard to build his endurance. (B) John hardly had any time to train regularly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If John trained day and night and worked very hard to build his endurance, it is more likely that he would finish the race in record time. Regular training and building endurance are important factors in marathon running, and it is unlikely that someone who hardly had any time to train regularly would be able to finish in record time."}}
{"Q": "Kolton loves apples. Which event could cause He ate three apples for dinner that night?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kolton didn't feel like preparing an actual dinner. (B) Kolton made a 3 course meal for dinner that was amazing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The fact that Kolton loves apples suggests that he would choose to eat them for dinner, especially if he didn't feel like preparing a full meal. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Kolton had a fancy dinner with multiple courses, which is less likely to include three apples as the main dish."}}
{"Q": "Jon decided to go on vacation. Which event could cause When Jon figured out, he fired the person?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jon received a call from an employee about a promotion. (B) His employee took advantage and only worked 20 hours that week.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His employee took advantage and only worked 20 hours that week.\nExplanation: If Jon found out that his employee took advantage and only worked 20 hours that week, it would be a valid reason for him to fire the person. This event shows that the employee was not responsible and did not fulfill their duties, which could have caused problems for Jon's business. On the other hand, receiving a call from an employee about a promotion would not necessarily lead to firing someone."}}
{"Q": "Tom was playing ball outside. Which event could cause Tom took the kitten home with him to keep?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom found a kitten. (B) Tom found a kitten meowing by itself that looked well cared for.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom found a kitten meowing by itself that looked well cared for.\nExplanation: If Tom found a kitten that looked well cared for and was meowing by itself, it is more likely that the kitten was lost or abandoned and in need of a home. This would be a plausible reason for Tom to take the kitten home with him to keep. If Tom simply found a kitten without any indication that it needed a home, he may not have felt the need to take it home with him."}}
{"Q": "Evelyn lived in a hotel in Mexico. Which event could cause A grocery store owner cashes Evelyn's checks with no ID?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her mom sent her paychecks for Evelyn to cash. (B) Evelyn cashes her checks at different grocery stores every week.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Evelyn's mom sent her paychecks for her to cash, rather than Evelyn randomly cashing her checks at different grocery stores every week. If Evelyn's mom sent her paychecks, it would make sense for her to have a relationship with a specific grocery store owner who would cash her checks without ID."}}
{"Q": "Jess overheard an employee incriminate themselves to another. Which event could cause The employee was confronted and dealt with accordingly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jess hid it from her manager who followed company procedure. (B) he knew thst against the regalastions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The employee was confronted and dealt with accordingly.\nExplanation: If Jess reported the incident to her manager, the manager would have followed company procedure and confronted the employee. This would lead to the employee being dealt with accordingly, which could include disciplinary action or termination depending on the severity of the incrimination. Option B does not make sense as it is incomplete and does not provide a clear explanation of what happened."}}
{"Q": "Alissa was very stressed out. Which event could cause Alissa felt very relaxed at the end of the day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So Alissa's friends took her to a spa to relax. (B) Alissa went home and worked more .", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. So Alissa's friends took her to a spa to relax.\nExplanation: Going to a spa is a common way to relax and destress. Alissa's friends recognized that she was stressed out and took her to a spa to help her relax. This would likely result in Alissa feeling more relaxed at the end of the day. On the other hand, going home and working more would only add to Alissa's stress and make her feel even more overwhelmed."}}
{"Q": "Simon noticed a moving truck in front of the house next door. Which event could cause He yelled at her and went home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The moving truck was blocking the sidewalk. (B) Simon was angry that Ann was leaving.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Simon was angry that Ann was leaving.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Simon's emotional state and behavior. If Simon was close to Ann and upset about her leaving, it would make sense for him to yell at her and go home. On the other hand, the moving truck blocking the sidewalk may be frustrating, but it doesn't necessarily explain Simon's extreme reaction."}}
{"Q": "Ella was taking her final exam. Which event could cause Ella was able to finish her exam on time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ella got to class early and was in no hurry. (B) Ella broke her pencil.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Ella got to class early and was in no hurry.\nExplanation: If Ella got to class early, she would have had enough time to settle down and prepare herself for the exam. Being in no hurry would have allowed her to take her time and carefully answer each question, ensuring that she finished the exam on time. Breaking her pencil, on the other hand, would have caused a delay and potentially slowed her down, making it less likely for her to finish on time."}}
{"Q": "Ron liked his new apartment, but it was pretty hot in there. Which event could cause Len helped Ron install it and the place became cool and comfortable?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ron had to buy a new air conditioning unit. (B) Len, Ron's friend brought him an old heating unit he had.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Ron had to buy a new air conditioning unit.\nExplanation: Since the apartment was hot, it is more plausible that Ron needed an air conditioning unit to cool the place down. Len helping Ron install it would then make the place cool and comfortable. Option B, where Len brings an old heating unit, would not make sense as it would only make the apartment hotter."}}
{"Q": "Devon woke up feeling terrible, with a stuffy head and sore throat. Which event could cause Devon rested up the rest of the day, knowing they were right?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Devon's children said he had a cold & should take it easy. (B) He went to the doctor and was diagnosed with the flu.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that Devon's children, who are close to him and may have noticed his symptoms, would suggest that he take it easy and rest. Going to the doctor and being diagnosed with the flu would require more time and effort, and may not be the first course of action for someone with cold-like symptoms."}}
{"Q": "Oscar never made his bed. Which event could cause She gave him a dessert treat?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Oscar relented and finally made his bed. (B) Oscar's mom finally made Oscar's bed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Oscar relented and finally made his bed.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Oscar would receive a dessert treat as a reward for finally making his bed, rather than his mom making his bed for him. This would also encourage good behavior and responsibility in Oscar."}}
{"Q": "My mother told me to fix the car. Which event could cause It turns out they were stolen the night before?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I went to get the parts out of my garage and grabbed them. (B) I wasn't sure what was wrong but the break lights were not coming on.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the car was stolen the night before, it is unlikely that the parts needed to fix it would still be in the garage. Option B, however, suggests that the car was not working properly and needed to be fixed, which could have led to the discovery that it was stolen."}}
{"Q": "Jessie wanted to adopt a dog so she drove to the local shelter. Which event could cause The puppy was happy again, and Jessie had found her new dog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A sad puppy caught her attention and wanted to be pet. (B) Jessie couldn't make a choice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: A sad puppy catching Jessie's attention and wanting to be pet could lead to her bonding with the puppy and ultimately deciding to adopt it. This event would cause the puppy to become happy again and Jessie to have found her new dog. Option B is not a plausible answer as it does not provide any reason for Jessie to find her new dog."}}
{"Q": "Gina's mom caught her yelling out the window on the 2nd floor. Which event could cause They opened the screen and began throwing things outside?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) But worse was to come from the bad storm. (B) Gina saw someone spray painting the building.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gina saw someone spray painting the building and became angry or upset, leading her to start throwing things out the window. A bad storm would not likely cause someone to start throwing things out the window."}}
{"Q": "Jerome wanted to buy a new television. Which event could cause Jerome enjoyed watching his favorite movies on his new television?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jerome set aside money from every paycheck for the television. (B) Jerome worked hard to save up money, and used it to sell a television.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it shows that Jerome worked hard to save up money specifically for buying a television. This means that he values having a good television and is likely to choose one that will provide him with a good viewing experience. Option A only shows that Jerome set aside money, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he will use it to buy a television or that he will choose a high-quality one."}}
{"Q": "Bob started working on Mturk to get some money. Which event could cause Bob eventually game a lead moderator of the MTG?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob spent hours doing HITs each day. (B) Bob decided to move down the work ladder.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Spending hours doing HITs each day would give Bob a lot of experience and knowledge about the platform, which could eventually lead to him being recognized as a skilled and knowledgeable worker. This could potentially lead to him being offered a lead moderator position. Moving down the work ladder would not necessarily lead to Bob becoming a lead moderator."}}
{"Q": "Uncle Jock couldn't believe he was rich. Which event could cause Jock lived the good life for a whole year, until he was poor again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He went to town and spent on extravagant things. (B) Jock poorly managed his finances.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jock poorly managed his finances, he could have easily spent all his money without realizing it. This is a more plausible answer than him going to town and spending on extravagant things, as it is unlikely that he would blow all his money in one go without any regard for his future financial stability."}}
{"Q": "Jen loved to take walks in gardens and see flowers. Which event could cause Jen cut a few flowers and took them home with her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jen took a walk an saw some long weeds. (B) She walked through a garden at the park.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She walked through a garden at the park.\nExplanation: Since Jen loves to take walks in gardens and see flowers, it is more plausible that she would cut a few flowers from a garden at the park rather than from some long weeds she saw on a walk. The park garden would have a variety of beautiful flowers to choose from, making it more likely that Jen would take some home with her."}}
{"Q": "Sue's husband always talked about a gorgeous celebrity. Which event could cause He took one look and said she had ruined her best feature?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) When she narrated about the celebrity's personal life to her husband. (B) His favorite celebrity got the bump removed from her nose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the celebrity getting the bump removed from her nose would cause Sue's husband to say she had ruined her best feature, as it directly relates to the physical appearance that he admired. Narrating about the celebrity's personal life may not necessarily affect his opinion on her physical appearance."}}
{"Q": "Emma went to the zoo today. Which event could cause Emma knows that if she wants to see a monkey she has to go to the zoo?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Emma wouldn't leave until she saw the monkeys. (B) Emma left before seeing monkeys.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Emma wouldn't leave until she saw the monkeys, it is likely that she knew beforehand that the zoo had monkeys and that she had a desire to see them. This suggests that she had prior knowledge of the zoo's animal exhibits and knew that monkeys were one of them."}}
{"Q": "I once had a grey cat. Which event could cause Eventually I moved and Hero stayed and it was sad?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cat was named Hero. (B) I decided to take Hero with me on the move.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I decided to take Hero with me on the move.\nExplanation: The statement \"Eventually I moved and Hero stayed and it was sad\" implies that the cat was left behind, which would not have happened if the owner had decided to take Hero with them on the move. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Stella was naturally good at basketball. Which event could cause She practiced extra long, and hard to prepare for that day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Stella got her team out of the championship game. (B) Stella hoped to make it to the WMBA.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Stella hoped to make it to the WMBA.\nExplanation: If Stella was naturally good at basketball, it is more likely that she would want to pursue a career in basketball, such as playing in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Therefore, it is more plausible that she would practice extra long and hard to prepare for that goal rather than just getting her team out of a championship game."}}
{"Q": "What time is it he thought shuffling through papers. Which event could cause Bill was stunned to see it was almost two o'clock?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bill thought he had lost track of time. (B) He decided to shuffle some papers before looking at the clock.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Bill thought he had lost track of time.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because if Bill had intentionally shuffled through papers before looking at the clock, he would have had some idea of what time it was. However, if he thought he had lost track of time, it would make sense that he was surprised to see it was almost two o'clock."}}
{"Q": "Amy's friend Erin told her Sara had been making fun of her. Which event could cause She decided she would call Sarah to hear her side?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy didn't know why Sara would make fun of her. (B) Amy wanted to be angry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Amy didn't know why Sara would make fun of her, she decided to call her to hear her side of the story. This shows that Amy is trying to understand the situation and get more information before reacting. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Amy is already angry and wants to confront Sara without hearing her side of the story, which is not a plausible explanation."}}
{"Q": "Gary always brought his lunch to work. Which event could cause Gary then bought something from the machine at work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) However, Gary had a craving for something sweet. (B) However, Gary craved something sweet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Option (A) is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Gary had a sudden craving for something sweet, which is a common reason for people to buy snacks from vending machines. Option (B) is essentially the same as option (A) but uses the word \"craved\" instead of \"had a craving,\" which makes it sound less natural."}}
{"Q": "Sarah drove around town one Saturday to get out of the house. Which event could cause She ate the ice cream and drove home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she noticed a new ice cream place and stopped to get some. (B) She visited her favorite homeless shelter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it directly explains why Sarah ate ice cream and drove home. Option B does not provide any explanation for why Sarah would have stopped to get ice cream."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy heard a mean comment that was directed towards him. Which event could cause Before he got extremely close, I called the teacher to handle him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So he yelled back and started walking to the boy. (B) I saw Jimmy lift a balloon behind the bully's head.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jimmy was about to hit the bully with a balloon, it is possible that he was feeling angry and wanted to retaliate. This could escalate the situation and potentially lead to physical violence. Therefore, it would be appropriate to call the teacher to handle the situation before it got out of hand. Option A suggests that Jimmy was already on the verge of confronting the bully, so calling the teacher may not have been as effective in preventing a physical altercation."}}
{"Q": "Lisa wanted to get a new puppy. Which event could cause Lisa and Gizmo went home together?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lisa bought a new pet in Chinatown, and named it Gizmo. (B) Lisa stole a puppy named gizmo at the shelter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Lisa went to a pet store or a breeder in Chinatown and purchased a new puppy, which she named Gizmo. This is a legal and ethical way to obtain a new pet. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that Lisa stole a puppy from a shelter, which is illegal and unethical. It is unlikely that Lisa would resort to theft to get a new puppy when there are legal and ethical ways to do so."}}
{"Q": "My cousin and I were about to go on the space mountain ride at Disney. Which event could cause Thankfully it was over before I knew it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We got on but the ride was broken we got off and cried from disappointment. (B) We were able to get in the front row and I closed my eyes the whole time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because the ride was still functioning and they were able to ride it. The fact that the narrator closed their eyes the whole time suggests that they were scared or nervous, but they were able to complete the ride without any major issues. Therefore, it is more likely that they would say \"Thankfully it was over before I knew it\" because they were able to get through the ride without any major problems."}}
{"Q": "There was a scared bird in a nest. Which event could cause The bird was okay and things were good?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Another bird came to eat the scared bird for dinner. (B) The birds mother returned to the nest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The birds mother returned to the nest.\nExplanation: The presence of the mother bird would provide comfort and security to the scared bird, indicating that things were good and the scared bird was safe. Option (A) is unlikely as it would result in harm to the scared bird, which would not lead to a positive outcome."}}
{"Q": "Gina's family was going to a funeral out of town. Which event could cause Gina read, and the little kids colored most of the drive there?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Everyone took a one plane, and Gina had to ride in the back with the kids. (B) The drive to the funeral was about 6 hours long.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the drive to the funeral was long and the kids were given coloring books or other activities to keep them occupied, while Gina may have chosen to read during the drive. It is less likely that everyone took a plane and Gina was forced to sit in the back with the kids, as seating arrangements on planes are typically assigned beforehand."}}
{"Q": "Venita used to love her job. Which event could cause She quit without notice?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Venita then grew tired but then she got over it. (B) Venita had a rough few months by clashing with her boss.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Venita had a rough few months by clashing with her boss, it is more plausible that she would quit without notice. This event would likely cause her to become frustrated and unhappy with her job, leading her to make the decision to leave abruptly. On the other hand, if Venita simply grew tired but then got over it, it is less likely that she would quit without notice as she would have already overcome her fatigue."}}
{"Q": "May bet her friend Jen that she could not complete a milk challenge. Which event could cause May won the bet?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jen started the milk challenge and failed it. (B) Jen stopped the milk challenge and failed it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Jen started the milk challenge and failed it, then May would have won the bet because Jen did not complete the challenge. If Jen stopped the milk challenge, it is unclear whether she would have been able to complete it or not, so it is not a definitive win for May. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Amy was as at the Minnesota State Fair with Beth. Which event could cause She purchased 2 more to take home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy had a big bear but was not satisfied. (B) Amy loved walking by the vendors.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Amy had a big bear but was not satisfied.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Amy purchased additional items because she was not satisfied with her initial purchase of a big bear. It is common for people to continue shopping and buying more items when they are not completely satisfied with their initial purchase. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide a clear reason for why Amy would purchase more items. Simply enjoying walking by vendors does not necessarily lead to purchasing more items."}}
{"Q": "Tommy was having a bad day. Which event could cause Tommy had bad friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) His friends commiserated about his bad day. (B) Tommy was ditched by both of his best friends even though they knew he was down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Tommy's best friends ditched him on a bad day, it is more likely that they are not good friends rather than just having a bad day themselves. Commiserating about his bad day could actually be a sign of good friends trying to support him."}}
{"Q": "Samantha wanted a treat. Which event could cause She had to run cold water on it to reduce the pain?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She burned her tongue on hot cookies. (B) Samantha burned the cookies while baking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She burned her tongue on hot cookies.\nExplanation: If Samantha burned the cookies while baking, she would not have had the opportunity to eat them and burn her tongue. It is more likely that she was eager to eat the freshly baked cookies and did not wait for them to cool down, resulting in a burned tongue. Running cold water on the tongue is a common remedy for this type of injury."}}
{"Q": "I was at a bar with some friends to celebrate. Which event could cause The strange man gave me a wink and turned away?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I saw a man across the rrom staring at us. (B) A gentleman approached me.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The strange man may have been reacting to the man across the room staring at them, possibly indicating that he knows the man or that the man is known for being creepy. It is less likely that a gentleman approaching the speaker would cause the strange man to give a wink and turn away, as this would not necessarily be a strange or unusual occurrence in a bar setting."}}
{"Q": "James had arranged to propose in a hot air balloon. Which event could cause They were drenched by the time the balloon landed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Unfortunately the darkness James picked there was a thunderstorm. (B) James was not counting on a rain storm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) James was not counting on a rain storm. \nExplanation: A rain storm would be a more plausible event that could cause them to be drenched, as opposed to a thunderstorm that was not mentioned in the scenario. James may have checked the weather forecast before the proposal, but unexpected weather changes can occur."}}
{"Q": "Quinton was getting evicted from his apartment. Which event could cause Quinton was so happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Quinton ended up not getting evicted. (B) His girlfriend said he could live at the shelter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Quinton ended up not getting evicted.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Quinton would be happy if he was able to keep his apartment and not face eviction, rather than having to live in a shelter. Therefore, option A is the more likely event that would cause Quinton to be happy."}}
{"Q": "Henry joined a pie eating contest. Which event could cause He told us that on the bright side, he got free food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Henry won the contest. (B) Henry lost the contest.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Henry lost the contest, he may have been disappointed that he didn't win, but he could still see the positive side of getting free food as a consolation prize. If he had won the contest, it would be more likely that he would focus on the achievement of winning rather than the fact that he got free food."}}
{"Q": "Andrew went camping. Which event could cause He made a mess in his sleeping bag that night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Andrew stayed up all night looking at the stars. (B) Andrew was very scared.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Andrew being scared is a more plausible event that could cause him to make a mess in his sleeping bag. It is possible that he may have had an accident due to fear or anxiety. Staying up all night looking at the stars would not necessarily lead to making a mess in his sleeping bag."}}
{"Q": "Noah was excited and nervous to use his new sled. Which event could cause It was a proud moment when Noah conquered his fear of the steep hill?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Noah was afraid of hitting a tree. (B) Noah decided to try it on the flattest streets.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Noah was afraid of hitting a tree, it would make sense that he was nervous to use his sled on a steep hill. Conquering his fear of hitting a tree and successfully navigating the hill would be a proud moment for him. Option B does not provide a clear reason for why Noah would be nervous or why conquering his fear would be a proud moment."}}
{"Q": "Matt and Zack were brothers and best friends. Which event could cause He ended up in the hospital because he broke his neck?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They rode bulls together. (B) They decided to go to bed early.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They rode bulls together.\nExplanation: Riding bulls is a dangerous activity that can result in serious injuries, such as a broken neck. It is more plausible that Matt and Zack were participating in a risky activity together, rather than simply going to bed early, which would not typically result in such a severe injury."}}
{"Q": "Oliver's bottle was dirty. Which event could cause When she was done, she gave him some water?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Oliver asked for help to clean her hands. (B) Mom took the bottle to the sink to get washed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Mom took the bottle to the sink to get washed.\nExplanation: If Oliver's bottle was dirty, it is more likely that someone would clean it before giving him water to drink. Option (A) does not provide any indication that Oliver's bottle was cleaned, whereas option (B) suggests that Oliver's mom took the bottle to the sink to get washed before giving him water. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jim's son Joe is a great guitar player. Which event could cause He is proud of how good his son is at playing guitar?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe has not real friends. (B) Jim's son Joe played at a local coffee shop.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jim's son Joe played at a local coffee shop.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Jim would be proud of his son's musical talent if he had the opportunity to showcase it in front of others, such as playing at a local coffee shop. The fact that Joe has no real friends does not necessarily have any correlation with his guitar playing ability."}}
{"Q": "Gretchen was feeling very sad as she walked to work one day. Which event could cause Gretchen felt happy because the prize cheered her up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She won a gift card for best performance. (B) She was hit and killed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She won a gift card for best performance.\nExplanation: Winning a gift card for best performance is a positive event that could lift Gretchen's mood and make her feel happy. On the other hand, being hit and killed is a tragic event that would not make her feel happy. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jackson was hungry for a milkshake. Which event could cause Jackson drank the delicious chocolate milkshake?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jackson blended a milkshake for his cousin. (B) Jackson put ice cream, syrup and milk in the blender.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Jackson put ice cream, syrup and milk in the blender, which is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Jackson was making a milkshake for himself. Choice A suggests that Jackson was making a milkshake for his cousin, which does not necessarily mean that he would have had the opportunity to drink the milkshake himself."}}
{"Q": "It was the end of the semester, and Jake needed to study for finals. Which event could cause Jake spent that night studying so he was ready for his test?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jake turned down his friend's party invitation. (B) Jake was excited for his tests.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jake turned down his friend's party invitation.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Jake would spend the night studying if he turned down a party invitation from his friend, as he would prioritize his studies over socializing. It is less likely that he would be excited for his tests, as most students feel some level of stress or anxiety before exams."}}
{"Q": "Timmy wanted to learn how to play video games. Which event could cause Unfortunately his older brother doesn't appreciate losing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Timmy lost to his older brother when they played. (B) He read a number of online how to manuals and learned how to beat his brother.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Timmy lost to his older brother when they played, it is more plausible that his older brother would become upset and not want to play with him again. This would prevent Timmy from being able to learn how to play video games from his older brother. On the other hand, if Timmy learned how to beat his brother by reading online manuals, his older brother may still be upset but it would not necessarily prevent Timmy from continuing to learn and play video games."}}
{"Q": "Sadie had just gotten off from work. Which event could cause Nervous, she ran the rest of the way?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There was thunder and lighting up ahead. (B) Walking home, Sadie noticed no one was following her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There was thunder and lighting up ahead.\nExplanation: Thunder and lightning can be a scary and intimidating experience for some people, causing them to feel nervous and anxious. Running the rest of the way home could be a natural response to wanting to get out of the storm as quickly as possible. On the other hand, not having anyone follow her while walking home may not necessarily be a cause for nervousness, as it could be a normal occurrence."}}
{"Q": "A man bought himself a rooster. Which event could cause It turns out they crow whenever they happen to feel like it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The rooster did not crow ever. (B) The man built a house for the rooster in the backyard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The rooster did not crow ever.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the rooster did not crow ever, as not all roosters crow at regular intervals or in response to external stimuli. Some roosters may crow more frequently than others, while some may not crow at all. Therefore, it is possible that the man's rooster simply did not feel like crowing, rather than the man building a house for the rooster causing it to crow whenever it wanted."}}
{"Q": "Mikey was desperately looking for work. Which event could cause He was so lucky to get some work?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided to send his daughter to many places. (B) He finally landed a job after several months.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He finally landed a job after several months.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Mikey's persistence in job searching and networking led to him finally landing a job after several months of searching. Sending his daughter to many places would not necessarily be related to him finding work."}}
{"Q": "Tara was camping by herself in the woods. Which event could cause She was able to successfully tap the hole shut?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tara tried to glue the hole. (B) Tara tried to tap the hole.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tara tried to tap the hole.\nExplanation: If Tara tried to glue the hole, it is unlikely that she would have been able to successfully tap the hole shut. Tapping the hole shut with a tool or object would be a more plausible solution for a camping situation where glue may not be readily available."}}
{"Q": "Sameer was running late to work. Which event could cause The $200 ticket he got was a reminder to never jaywalk again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He ran across the road not at a light. (B) Sameer drove across the street in a hurry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: The $200 ticket for jaywalking suggests that Sameer was on foot and crossed the road not at a designated crosswalk or traffic light. It is unlikely that he would receive a ticket for driving across the street in a hurry."}}
{"Q": "Lucy and her grandma were leaving Blockbuster. Which event could cause He refused because once a day is enough?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy's brother didn't want to see another \"chick flick\" with her and their grandma. (B) Later that day Lucy asked her grandpa to take her back to school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it directly relates to the situation at Blockbuster and involves Lucy and her grandma. Option B is unrelated and doesn't provide any context for why someone would refuse to go back to school."}}
{"Q": "Bill put his dog in the fence and went out for the night. Which event could cause Then he saw the lawn was filled with half-eaten mushrooms?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bill went out to get his dog. (B) He came back to an hindered fence gate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He came back to a hindered fence gate.\nExplanation: If Bill had gone out to get his dog, he would have noticed the hindered fence gate before leaving. However, if the fence gate was hindered, the dog could have escaped and eaten the mushrooms. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Two best friends from Boston write a movie together. Which event could cause Their movies sell billions of dollars of tickets over the next 20 year?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Eventually they get someone to make the movie. (B) They work a little to get their movies in the theaters.", "R": {"text": "Answer: They get discovered by a successful producer or director who believes in their talent and helps them bring their movies to a wider audience.\nExplanation: While it is important for the friends to work hard to get their movies in theaters, it is not enough to guarantee billions of dollars in ticket sales over the next 20 years. The key factor is having a powerful ally in the industry who can help promote and distribute their films to a wider audience. This could be a successful producer or director who recognizes their talent and believes in their vision, or a major studio that sees the potential for profit in their work. With the right support and resources, the friends' movies could become cultural phenomena that resonate with audiences around the world, leading to massive box office success over the next two decades."}}
{"Q": "Jack went to the pet store after school. Which event could cause Jack was so sad he cried himself to sleep?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jack pet one of the dogs and got bit. (B) Jack found out one of the pets he liked had babies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Jack got bit by one of the dogs, it could have caused him physical pain and emotional distress, leading him to cry himself to sleep. On the other hand, finding out that one of the pets he liked had babies is not necessarily a negative event and would not likely cause such a strong emotional reaction."}}
{"Q": "My roommate slams doors when he leaves a room. Which event could cause He agreed to at the end of the month?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The landlord requested that Steve move out. (B) I asked my roommate to make lots of jarring noises.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is unlikely that asking the roommate to make more noise would result in him agreeing to move out at the end of the month. However, if the landlord requested that Steve move out, it could be a reason for him to agree to leave."}}
{"Q": "I took my girlfriend out to the restaurant. Which event could cause My girlfriend didn't have any money and I ended up paying for it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She forget her purse at home. (B) We ate and had to eat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If she forgot her purse at home, it is more likely that she wouldn't have any money to pay for the meal. Option B doesn't make sense as it implies that we had to eat and therefore I had to pay, which doesn't explain why my girlfriend didn't have any money."}}
{"Q": "The elementary school was have a father-daughter dance. Which event could cause It was the perfect first dance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ellie asked her dad to the concert and her dad agreed. She stood on his feet as he moved to the music. (B) So many fathers and daughters attended the dance.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A describes a scenario where Ellie and her dad danced together, which could be seen as a perfect first dance for them. Option B does not provide any information about a specific father-daughter dance, so it cannot be the event that caused the perfect first dance."}}
{"Q": "Lina has two kids. Which event could cause Lina gave the clothes to charity?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her kids had a ton of clothes. (B) Lina's children ripped all of their clothes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Lina's kids had a ton of clothes, it is possible that Lina decided to donate some of them to charity. However, if Lina's children ripped all of their clothes, it is more likely that Lina would need to buy new clothes for them rather than giving away the ripped ones. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ynez decided on a whim to learn how to dance to a foxtrot. Which event could cause Ynez learned the dance from the internet instead?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ynez took a car in town but did not like having to go to it. (B) Ynez was going to learn from an instructor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Ynez was planning to learn from an instructor but then found online resources, it would be more plausible for her to switch to learning from the internet instead of going through the hassle of finding and attending classes with an instructor. Option (A) does not provide a clear reason for why Ynez would switch to learning from the internet."}}
{"Q": "Ben decided to treat himself to a coffee. Which event could cause Ben was happy after getting the call from the bank?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ben was waiting to hear back about a coffee. (B) Ben was waiting to hear back about a job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Ben was waiting to hear back about a job and received a call from the bank, it is possible that the call was to inform him that he got the job. This would make him happy and could cause him to feel like treating himself to a coffee. On the other hand, if Ben was waiting to hear back about a coffee, it is unlikely that he would be so happy to receive a call about it that he would treat himself to another coffee."}}
{"Q": "John was driving to work one day. Which event could cause Unfortunately, he ended up being late to work?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was an accident but cleared on the route that John was driving. (B) John decides to take a short cut through the city to save time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There was an accident but cleared on the route that John was driving.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because accidents can cause traffic delays and slow down the flow of traffic. Even if the accident is cleared, there may still be residual traffic that could cause John to be late to work. Taking a shortcut through the city may or may not save time, depending on traffic and other factors, so it is not as likely to be the cause of John being late."}}
{"Q": "The Stone family was on a bus headed towards the Great Pyramid. Which event could cause Upon arriving at the pyramids, the Stone family thanked the driver?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Stones car broke down and they had to call a taxi. (B) The Stone family got there late.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The Stone family got there late.\nExplanation: If the Stones' car broke down and they had to call a taxi, they would not have been on the bus in the first place. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer. However, if the Stone family got there late, they would have been grateful to the driver for waiting for them or for getting them to the pyramid on time. This makes option B the more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to take a guy on a date. Which event could cause I'm really looking forward to it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I asked my neighbor out. (B) The guy I like said yes, he voted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it directly relates to the person the question is asking about - the guy they like. Option A is about asking a neighbor out, which may not necessarily be the person they want to take on a date. Additionally, option B includes the guy saying yes, which is a positive response and would likely cause excitement and anticipation for the upcoming date."}}
{"Q": "Sandy lived in New York. Which event could cause Sandy decided to go outside and make a snowman?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It snowed in New York. (B) It rained in New York.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It snowed in New York.\nExplanation: Snow is a common occurrence in New York during the winter months, and building a snowman is a popular activity for both children and adults. On the other hand, rain would not be a suitable weather condition for making a snowman. Therefore, it is more plausible that Sandy would decide to go outside and make a snowman if it snowed in New York."}}
{"Q": "The sun was shining brightly and it was very warm. Which event could cause Startled and out of breath, Sue ran into her house?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Something was lurking in the little grass across the field. (B) Unexpectedly a bear came from the woods.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Something was lurking in the little grass across the field.\nExplanation: While option (B) is a possibility, it is less likely as bears are not commonly found in residential areas. Option (A) is more plausible as something lurking in the grass could startle Sue and cause her to run into her house. It could be a snake, a wild animal, or even a person."}}
{"Q": "Becky was suspicious that someone was eating her cookies. Which event could cause Becky was surprised to find herself sleepwalking to them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Becky put her cookies under the camera to catch someone. (B) Becky put her cookies under the mattress to catch someone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Becky put her cookies under the mattress to catch someone.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it suggests that Becky was so suspicious that she took extreme measures to catch the cookie thief. Putting the cookies under the mattress would make it difficult for someone to take them without disturbing Becky's sleep, which could explain why she was surprised to find herself sleepwalking to them. On the other hand, putting the cookies under a camera seems less likely as it would require Becky to have access to a camera and the technical knowledge to set it up, which is not mentioned in the question."}}
{"Q": "Jim found a stray cat walking on the street. Which event could cause Now, Jim's cat lives in Jim's house and it is his pet?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim decided to look for the owner and he found the owner. (B) Jim took it home and gave it a bath.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jim took the cat home and gave it a bath, it is more likely that he would develop a bond with the cat and decide to keep it as his pet. If he found the owner and returned the cat, he would not have the opportunity to keep it as his own pet."}}
{"Q": "Mr Qu was a famous statesman from China. Which event could cause He ended up being voted Man of the Year?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mr. Qu gave back to the community. (B) Mr. Qu was know throughout the company for his greed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Mr. Qu gave back to the community.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Mr. Qu was voted Man of the Year for his philanthropic efforts and contributions to the community rather than for being known for his greed. Giving back to the community is a highly valued trait and is often recognized and celebrated."}}
{"Q": "Liz was babysitting a 5 year old boy. Which event could cause When she heard him giggling from a closet, Liz was relieved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Liz was playing hide and seek and found the boy. (B) The boy ran from Liz crying and hid.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Liz was playing hide and seek with the boy and found him giggling in the closet, rather than the boy running away and hiding while crying. The giggling suggests that the boy was having fun and enjoying the game, which is a more likely scenario in a babysitting situation."}}
{"Q": "A group of friends went to a restaurant. Which event could cause The meals were worth the wait because it was the best quality?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They sat there for an hour. (B) the food was really made fast.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) They sat there for an hour.\nExplanation: If the group of friends had to wait for an hour to be served their meals, it is more likely that they would appreciate the quality of the food and feel that it was worth the wait. This is because the wait time could indicate that the food was being freshly prepared and cooked to order, rather than pre-made and reheated quickly. On the other hand, if the food was made really fast (option B), it is less likely that the meals would be of the best quality as they would have been rushed and not given enough time to be cooked properly."}}
{"Q": "I had pancakes for breakfast today. Which event could cause So long blueberries, we had a good time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had them without the fruit topping and they were surprisingly delicious. (B) I used the abundance of our blueberries we have with them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Option (B) is the more plausible answer as it involves the use of blueberries, which is directly related to the statement \"So long blueberries, we had a good time.\" Option (A) does not involve blueberries at all, making it less likely to be the cause of the statement."}}
{"Q": "James realizes he hasn't left his home in days. Which event could cause James is still happy that he has at least left the house?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) James ran out of groceries but didn't go to the store. (B) James left and had nowhere to go.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If James ran out of groceries but didn't go to the store, it would imply that he had been inside for a while but was still happy that he had at least left the house to get groceries. On the other hand, if James left and had nowhere to go, it wouldn't make sense for him to be happy about leaving the house if he didn't have a purpose or destination."}}
{"Q": "Marsha had just moved in with her husband. Which event could cause Marsha was elated?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Marsha bought her husband flowers when she got home. (B) Marsha discovered that an old friend lived in the neighborhood as she introduced herself to the neighbors.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Marsha discovered that an old friend lived in the neighborhood as she introduced herself to the neighbors.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause Marsha to feel elated because it involves reconnecting with an old friend, which can bring feelings of happiness and excitement. Buying her husband flowers may also make her happy, but it is not as significant as reconnecting with a friend."}}
{"Q": "The little boy brought his bike home. Which event could cause His mother felt terrible when she saw the helmet strap was broken?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) his mother ran over his helmet in the driveway. (B) He had to walk because he got a flat tire.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because if the mother ran over the helmet, it could have caused damage to the strap. Option B, on the other hand, does not involve the helmet at all, so it is less likely to cause the mother to feel terrible about the broken strap."}}
{"Q": "Kate was at Summer camp. Which event could cause She screeched and climbed out of the water?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She went for a swim. (B) Kate saw a big fish in the lake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Kate saw a big fish in the lake.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kate screeched and climbed out of the water because she saw a big fish in the lake, as opposed to simply going for a swim. Seeing a big fish could have startled her and caused her to react in that way."}}
{"Q": "David's dad bought a new television. Which event could cause The television can not be returned?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was broken when Dad dropped it. (B) The television stopped working after the return date.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The television stopped working after the return date.\nExplanation: If the television was broken when Dad dropped it, it would likely be covered under the warranty or return policy. However, if the television stopped working after the return date, the store may not accept the return as it is no longer within the return period."}}
{"Q": "Fred applied for a new job. Which event could cause He just gave up on the job because he didn't know where to look?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He hadn't heard anything from any employers. (B) The interviewer couldn't find the interview location.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The interviewer couldn't find the interview location.\nExplanation: If the interviewer couldn't find the interview location, Fred may have become frustrated and given up on the job. This event could have caused him to feel like the job wasn't worth pursuing if the employer couldn't even find the interview location. On the other hand, not hearing anything from employers is a common occurrence during the job search process and wouldn't necessarily cause someone to give up on a job."}}
{"Q": "Dave had entered a raffle at work this past weekend. Which event could cause The winners were announced, and Dave had won the top prize?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dave told his co-workers that if he won, he would buy them all lunch for a week. (B) Steve told his co-workers that if he won, he would buy them all lunch for a week.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The fact that Dave had won the top prize suggests that he had entered the raffle and had a chance of winning. Option A provides a plausible reason for Dave winning the top prize, as he had made a promise to buy his co-workers lunch for a week if he won. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide any connection between Steve and Dave's win, making it less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Bill was an attractive man. Which event could cause He felt and looked much better after shaving?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bill was out to make an impression on a new boss. (B) Bill grew a beard, but felt less attractive with it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Bill was out to make an impression on a new boss, he would want to look his best and may have felt that shaving would improve his appearance. On the other hand, if Bill grew a beard but felt less attractive with it, shaving may not necessarily make him feel and look much better. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Emily was looking for something in her brother's room. Which event could cause Emily got in big trouble with her mom?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Emily's brother told on her. (B) Emily went through her brother's drawer, but left before her mom could catch her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Emily's brother told on her.\nExplanation: If Emily's brother tells on her, her mom will find out that she was in his room without permission. This could lead to Emily getting in trouble with her mom for invading her brother's privacy and not respecting his personal space. On the other hand, if Emily left before her mom could catch her, there is no evidence that she was in her brother's room and therefore, she may not get in trouble."}}
{"Q": "The Levins owned a small corner store. Which event could cause They made more than enough money to take a cab whenever they wanted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Levins had many bugs. (B) Levin was very successful at running the store.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Levin was very successful at running the store.\nExplanation: If Levin was successful at running the store, it would mean that the store was making a good profit. This would allow the Levins to have more disposable income and be able to afford luxuries like taking a cab whenever they wanted. On the other hand, having many bugs in the store would likely drive away customers and decrease profits, making it less likely for the Levins to have extra money for cab rides. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ana didn't like dogs and never had. Which event could cause She and her husband went out to buy a dog as soon as they could?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ana decided to never change her mind. (B) One day when Anna was about to be attacked by a mugger dog came out of nowhere and attacked him 1st.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a life-threatening event like being attacked by a mugger would change Ana's perspective on dogs and make her want to get one for protection. Option A does not provide a convincing reason for Ana's sudden change of heart towards dogs."}}
{"Q": "Last night I had to be home in time for the new episode I had to watch Which event could cause I couldn't wait for the new one the following week?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was very exciting and there was a cliff hanger. (B) I really hated this week's episode.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If the episode was very exciting and ended with a cliffhanger, it would make sense for the person to not want to wait a week to find out what happens next. On the other hand, if the person hated the episode, they would not be as eager to watch the next one and may not mind waiting a week."}}
{"Q": "Ed was visiting California. Which event could cause But gradually, he got a little better at surfing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) At first, Ed could not buy a surfboard. (B) Ed tried surfing for the first time and loved it so much he kept trying.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Ed tried surfing for the first time and loved it so much he kept trying.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Ed's love for surfing and determination to improve would lead to him gradually getting better, rather than simply not being able to buy a surfboard at first."}}
{"Q": "Millie enjoyed playing peek-a-boo. Which event could cause Millie's excitement about her new friend lasted until nap time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Millie was playing peek-a-boo with a friend. (B) Millie invited her dog over to play.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Millie was playing peek-a-boo with a friend.\nExplanation: Since Millie enjoys playing peek-a-boo, it is more plausible that her excitement would last until nap time if she was playing with a friend rather than inviting her dog over to play. Dogs may not be able to play peek-a-boo in the same way as humans, so it is less likely that Millie's excitement would last as long if she was playing with her dog."}}
{"Q": "Tyler's kids were getting too much screen time. Which event could cause Everyone seemed much happier?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tyler decided to entertain his kids another way - with a movie party. (B) Someone complained to the teacher.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tyler decided to entertain his kids another way - with a movie party.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that Tyler took action to reduce his kids' screen time and provided an alternative form of entertainment. A movie party could involve physical activity, social interaction, and creativity, which are all important for children's development and well-being. It also implies that Tyler was proactive and responsive to his kids' needs, which could improve their relationship and overall mood. On the other hand, someone complaining to the teacher may not necessarily lead to a positive outcome, as it could create tension and resentment among the parties involved. It also does not address the root cause of the problem or offer a constructive solution. Therefore, option A is a more likely scenario for improving everyone's happiness."}}
{"Q": "Steve had a lot of parking tickets. Which event could cause Steve, dejected, resolved to be more careful in the future?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He refused to pay them all. (B) There was a boot put on his car.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) There was a boot put on his car.\nExplanation: Having a boot put on his car would be a more plausible event to cause Steve to feel dejected and resolved to be more careful in the future. This is because having a boot put on his car would prevent him from being able to drive it until he paid off his parking tickets, which would be a frustrating and inconvenient consequence. Refusing to pay the tickets would not necessarily cause Steve to feel dejected or resolved to be more careful in the future, as he may simply continue to park illegally and accumulate more tickets."}}
{"Q": "Tim was painting. Which event could cause Until he decided to paint a pretty picture on his shirt?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He decided he wanted to make it more personal and the teacher was ok with it. (B) Tim hated the new colors of paint his mother had bought him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tim disliked the new colors of paint his mother had bought him, which could have led him to paint on his shirt out of frustration or boredom. It is less likely that the teacher would allow Tim to paint on his shirt as a way to make it more personal."}}
{"Q": "Ezekiel was herding his sheep one fall evening. Which event could cause Ezekiel jumped from the hide and stabbed the wolf in the neck?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ezeikiel noticed there wasn't a wolf trying to attack his sheep. (B) A wolf appeared near the sheep.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ezekiel would jump from the hide and stab the wolf in the neck if a wolf appeared near the sheep, as this would be a clear threat to his flock. If there was no wolf present, there would be no reason for Ezekiel to take such drastic action."}}
{"Q": "My friend introduced me to a close friend of his. Which event could cause When I decided to ask, she barely had anything to say?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I thought this person was one who stole from me before. (B) She turned out to be very chatty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I thought this person was one who stole from me before.\nExplanation: If the person being introduced was someone the asker thought had stolen from them before, they may have been hesitant to engage in conversation and may have been guarded in their interactions. This could have led to the person being less talkative and having little to say. On the other hand, if the person turned out to be very chatty (option B), it would not have caused the asker to have difficulty in getting them to talk."}}
{"Q": "The Goetschius family moved to the Outer Banks. Which event could cause They ended up really enjoying their new home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Goetschius family enjoys peace. (B) They planned to build a house next year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The Goetschius family enjoys peace.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer as enjoying peace is a positive experience that can contribute to one's overall enjoyment of their home. Moving to the Outer Banks, which is known for its natural beauty and tranquility, could have provided the Goetschius family with a sense of peace and relaxation that they may not have experienced in their previous home. Building a house next year may also contribute to their enjoyment, but it is not a guarantee and may not be the sole reason for their satisfaction with their new home."}}
{"Q": "Amy decided to cook quinoa for her dinner. Which event could cause Amy realized she needed to learn how to season food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The pie ended up tasting plain. (B) Amy food tasted plain.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Amy's food tasted plain, it is more likely that she realized she needed to learn how to season food. The fact that the pie ended up tasting plain (option A) is not directly related to Amy's decision to learn how to season food for her quinoa dinner."}}
{"Q": "Franklin wanted to send a birthday card to his grandmother. Which event could cause Franklin dropped the envelope into the mailbox?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Franklin prepared the note and envelope. (B) Franklin addressed the package and sent it yesterday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Franklin had already addressed and sent the package yesterday, it is more likely that he accidentally dropped the envelope into the mailbox while trying to put it in. If he had just prepared the note and envelope, he would have been more careful when putting it in the mailbox."}}
{"Q": "Noah had a cold. Which event could cause After two days, Noah felt better?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Noah ate cold cuts and got a lot of rest. (B) Noah took his prescribed medicine and stayed home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Noah took his prescribed medicine and stayed home.\nExplanation: It is more likely that taking prescribed medicine and resting at home would help Noah recover from his cold, rather than eating cold cuts. Cold cuts are not known to have any medicinal properties and may even worsen Noah's condition if they are not properly stored or handled. Rest and medication are commonly recommended treatments for colds, making option B the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kayla went for a manicure. Which event could cause She left with a beautiful nails and complete satisfaction?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The doctor was very diligent and didn't overlook any detail. (B) Kayla tried a new nail shop.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it directly relates to the outcome of Kayla leaving with beautiful nails and complete satisfaction. The diligence of the doctor in not overlooking any detail would ensure that Kayla's nails were done perfectly, which would result in her satisfaction. Option B may or may not have any impact on the outcome, as trying a new nail shop could have positive or negative results."}}
{"Q": "Joe went to college for art. Which event could cause Then he got hired?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He graduated with a degree and decided to apply for a job as an art teacher. (B) He didn't graduate, but decided to apply for a job as an art teacher.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe would need to graduate with a degree in art before being hired for a job in the field. Many employers require a degree or some form of formal education in the subject area before considering a candidate for a position. Additionally, the fact that Joe went to college specifically for art suggests that he was pursuing a career in the field, making it more likely that he would apply for a job related to his degree after graduation."}}
{"Q": "Roan and his family ate a lot of fruits and veggies. Which event could cause Roan was glad he had come up with such a 'green' idea?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Roan thought they should invest in a kitchen garden and grow some fruits and veggies. (B) Roan thought they should invest in a kitchen garden and grow some flowers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Roan thought they should invest in a kitchen garden and grow some fruits and veggies.\nExplanation: Since Roan and his family ate a lot of fruits and veggies, it would make sense for him to suggest investing in a kitchen garden to grow their own produce. This would not only ensure that they have access to fresh and healthy food, but it would also be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly option. Therefore, Roan would be glad he had come up with such a 'green' idea. On the other hand, investing in a kitchen garden to grow flowers would not be as practical or beneficial for their health and nutrition."}}
{"Q": "Ed was starving when his dad handed him his ham sandwich. Which event could cause His dad shared his sandwich with him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ed's dad was hungry. (B) Ed asked his dad her some of the sandwich.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ed's dad shared his sandwich because he himself was hungry, rather than Ed asking for some of it. It is a natural instinct to share food when someone close to us is hungry, and it is likely that Ed's dad noticed his son's hunger and offered to share his sandwich."}}
{"Q": "Jay went to pick up his mail. Which event could cause Jay looked at it and pick it up with great effort?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He opened the door, finding one postcard. (B) Jay dropped his mail on the ground and it went all over.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jay dropped his mail on the ground and it went all over, he would have to pick it up with great effort. On the other hand, finding one postcard behind the door would not require much effort to pick up."}}
{"Q": "Georgia was checking her email. Which event could cause Finally, she had a clean empty inbox?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Georgia hasn't kept any of her emails in a year. (B) Georgia deleted the messages as she read them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Georgia deleted the messages as she read them, it is more likely that she would have a clean empty inbox. Option A suggests that Georgia hasn't kept any of her emails in a year, which is possible, but it doesn't necessarily mean that her inbox is empty."}}
{"Q": "Sam and his wife were busy packing for their trip. Which event could cause Sam and his wife had a great time together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam and his wife had a great time packing for their trip. (B) Sam and his wife went on a cruise.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Going on a cruise is a leisure activity that is often associated with relaxation and enjoyment. Therefore, it is more likely that Sam and his wife would have a great time together while on a cruise rather than just packing for their trip."}}
{"Q": "Loudoun decided it was time to purchase a new microphone. Which event could cause Loudoun felt great joy as he listened to himself through his new mic?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Loudoun bought a good grilled cheese. (B) Loudoun went to the store and picked up a great new mic and brought it home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Loudoun would feel great joy from listening to himself through his new microphone, as it is a new and improved tool for his work or hobby. Buying a good grilled cheese may bring satisfaction or pleasure, but it is unlikely to cause great joy in the same way as a new microphone."}}
{"Q": "One day a salesman came by my office. Which event could cause It sold for $20?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The salesman was selling a vacuum cleaner. (B) The salesman showed me a new car for his company.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a vacuum cleaner would be sold for $20 by a salesman who came to an office, rather than a new car being sold for such a low price. Additionally, it is common for door-to-door salesmen to sell vacuum cleaners."}}
{"Q": "Larry was running late for work. Which event could cause He had gotten the wrong one in his hurry?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He picked out a tie as he was running out of the door. (B) He make sure he get the correct tie as he was running out of the door.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Larry grabbed the wrong tie in his rush to leave, rather than taking the time to make sure he got the correct one."}}
{"Q": "Rachel won a free skydiving trip. Which event could cause Her instructor teased Rachel as she floated far down?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rachel was not afraid to do it. (B) She took a test dive in an air tunnel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Rachel was not afraid to do it.\nExplanation: If Rachel was not afraid to do the skydiving, it is possible that her instructor teased her as she floated far down as a way to lighten the mood and make the experience more enjoyable for her. However, if Rachel had taken a test dive in an air tunnel, it would not necessarily lead to her instructor teasing her during the actual skydiving experience."}}
{"Q": "Grandma always enjoyed knitting. Which event could cause Grandma put the knitting kit to good use?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Grandma got us a kit for Christmas. (B) Grandma saw I had a hole in my jeans.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Grandma saw I had a hole in my jeans.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Grandma would put her knitting kit to good use if she saw that someone needed something repaired, such as a hole in their jeans. Getting a knitting kit for Christmas may inspire her to start knitting, but it does not necessarily mean she will immediately put it to use."}}
{"Q": "Daria wanted a new sweater. Which event could cause She found a beautiful sweater and ordered it right away?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She used the internet to find the perfect sweater. (B) She went all around town to find a sweater.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Daria used the internet to find the perfect sweater, it is more likely that she would come across a wider variety of options and be able to easily order the sweater she wanted. Going all around town would be more time-consuming and may not guarantee finding the perfect sweater."}}
{"Q": "Toby was the Sullivan family's very first dog. Which event could cause Toby lived until he was 16 years old?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Sullivan's treated Toby like a family member. (B) The Sullivan's treated Toby like a family member for 2 years.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The Sullivan's treating Toby like a family member for 2 years may have had some positive impact on his health and well-being, but it is unlikely to be the sole reason for him living until he was 16 years old. Treating Toby like a family member for his entire life would have provided him with consistent love, care, and attention, which could have contributed to his longevity. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My work as a janitor keeps me busy throughout the day. Which event could cause Lastly, I clean floors with a vacuum cleaner?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I have a full schedule to follow: emptying trash, cleaning restrooms, dusting, refilling containers. (B) I mop all of the floors first.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since the person's work as a janitor involves multiple tasks, it is more plausible that they have a full schedule to follow and vacuuming the floors is one of the last tasks on their list. Mopping the floors first would not make sense as it would make the floors wet and dirty again, requiring the janitor to vacuum them again."}}
{"Q": "Sally went to the pet store the other day. Which event could cause Sally now has a goldfish named Puppy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sally looked at the fish tanks and wanted one. (B) Sally wanted a pet that required lots of care.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Sally saw the goldfish in the pet store and decided she wanted one, rather than specifically seeking out a pet that required lots of care and settling on a goldfish. Additionally, the name \"Puppy\" suggests that Sally may have chosen the goldfish on a whim or for its cute appearance, rather than for its level of care required."}}
{"Q": "Last night my girlfriend and I got into a fight. Which event could cause She hasn't answered my calls all day today her profile says single?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She stormed out of my dump and I didn't talk to her all night. (B) She stormed out of my house and I didn't talk to her all night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She stormed out of my house and I didn't talk to her all night.\nExplanation: If she stormed out of the house and didn't talk to you all night, it's possible that she's upset and needs some space. Her not answering your calls and changing her relationship status on social media could be a sign that she's considering ending the relationship. It's important to give her some time and space to cool off before trying to reach out to her again."}}
{"Q": "I did not know Doug's wife's name so I asked him. Which event could cause Finally I looked at Dougs wife death certificate and learned her name?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Doug allowed me to look through some paperwork. (B) Doug told me her wife is dead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Doug told me her wife is dead.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Doug would have mentioned his wife's death and her name during the conversation when asked about her name. It is not very common for someone to allow another person to look through their personal paperwork, especially related to a deceased loved one. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ben liked to play around with animals. Which event could cause The dog bit Ben because he was being rough with him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben found a new dog. (B) Ben started stroking a dog a little too gently.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The dog bit Ben because he was being rough with him.\nExplanation: This is the most plausible answer as it is common for dogs to bite when they feel threatened or uncomfortable. If Ben was being rough with the dog, it is likely that the dog felt uncomfortable and reacted by biting him. Finding a new dog or stroking a dog too gently would not necessarily lead to a dog biting Ben."}}
{"Q": "Petey liked to cook. Which event could cause Petey's wife was thrilled?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Petey uneducated new dishes. (B) Petey cooked dinner that night instead of his wife.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Petey cooking dinner instead of his wife would be a plausible event that could cause his wife to be thrilled. It shows that Petey is taking initiative and helping out with household chores, which can be a relief for his wife. Additionally, if Petey is a good cook, his wife may be excited to try his cooking and enjoy a break from cooking herself. On the other hand, Petey uneducated new dishes may not necessarily be a cause for excitement unless his wife is particularly interested in trying new foods or Petey has a history of not being a good cook."}}
{"Q": "Nay wanted a pet but she was allergic to cats. Which event could cause She got four fish and loved watching them every day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nay researched what pets would be good for people allergic to cats. (B) Nay decided to get something other than a fish.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it shows that Nay took the time to research what pets would be suitable for her allergies and found that fish would be a good option. It also explains how she ended up with four fish and why she enjoys watching them every day. Option B does not provide any explanation for why Nay would choose something other than a fish or what pet she would choose instead."}}
{"Q": "Chloe got tickets for an upcoming hockey game. Which event could cause Chloe's team won and she took home an extra souvenir?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Chloe went to the game and cheered on her team. (B) Chloe went to the hockey game and caught a puck.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Chloe went to the game and cheered on her team.\nExplanation: While it is possible for Chloe to catch a puck at the hockey game, it is not very likely. On the other hand, if Chloe cheers on her team and they win, it is possible that she could take home an extra souvenir such as a t-shirt or a signed puck. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lois was often bullied at his elementary school. Which event could cause Now Lois is learning well and much happier?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lois got help from an adult to solve the problem when his grades started dropping. (B) The bullies finally stood up to Lois.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Getting help from an adult to solve the bullying problem and improve academic performance is a more plausible answer. It is unlikely that the bullies suddenly standing up to Lois would make him happier and improve his learning. In fact, it could make the situation worse. Getting help from an adult would provide Lois with support and resources to address the bullying and improve his overall well-being."}}
{"Q": "Lucy ordered some pizza. Which event could cause Lucy had to heat it up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When it got to Lucy it was cold. (B) When the pizza arrived it was hot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the pizza arrived cold, it would be necessary for Lucy to heat it up in order to enjoy it. If the pizza arrived hot, there would be no need to heat it up. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gina drove past the dry ski slope near her home. Which event could cause Just then she saw a large machine spraying fake snow on the slope?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gina wanted to go skiing as soon as she could. (B) How Gina wished it would rain so she could get wet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Gina wanted to go skiing as soon as she could.\nExplanation: The fact that Gina saw a machine spraying fake snow on the slope suggests that the ski slope is preparing for skiing season. Therefore, it is more plausible that Gina would want to go skiing as soon as she could rather than wishing for rain to get wet, which is not related to skiing."}}
{"Q": "Jason had always admired the fast movements of boxers he saw on TV. Which event could cause His wrestling matches were very exciting?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He used some of the footwork to use in his wrestling. (B) He used some of the work to rest his foot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He used some of the footwork to use in his wrestling.\nExplanation: Since Jason admired the fast movements of boxers, it is likely that he tried to incorporate some of their techniques into his own wrestling style. Using footwork from boxing could have made his wrestling matches more exciting and dynamic. On the other hand, option B does not make sense as \"resting his foot\" would not have any impact on the excitement level of his matches."}}
{"Q": "Tom decided to go skiing in a snowstorm. Which event could cause He had a cup of hot chocolate with his friends at the lodge?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) tom got stranded but got rescued by his friends. (B) It was bad but it was too cold for Tom so they stayed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It was bad but it was too cold for Tom so they stayed.\nExplanation: If Tom decided to go skiing in a snowstorm, it is likely that he would still go skiing despite the weather conditions. However, if it was too cold for him, he may have decided to stay in the lodge with his friends and have a cup of hot chocolate. This event is more plausible than Tom getting stranded and needing to be rescued by his friends."}}
{"Q": "Jill and Lisa had been best friends for years. Which event could cause Lisa was so upset?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was really rude to her. (B) Lisa was really rude to Jill.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Lisa was really rude to Jill, it would not make sense for Lisa to be upset. However, if Jill was really rude to Lisa, it would be more plausible for Lisa to be upset as it would go against their long-standing friendship."}}
{"Q": "Amy was at the grocery store shopping for the week. Which event could cause Amy had to chase lemons half way across the parking lot?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She spilled one of her grocery bags at checkout before paying. (B) Amy's bag broke in half.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Amy's bag broke in half.\nExplanation: If Amy's bag broke in half, it is more likely that the lemons fell out and rolled away, causing her to chase after them. If she had spilled one of her grocery bags at checkout before paying, it is unlikely that the lemons would have rolled all the way across the parking lot."}}
{"Q": "Mary was signed up for a secret santa. Which event could cause She had it sent to her match?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mary went to the store for a makeup kit. (B) Mary was evil and put rattlesnakes in her gift-box.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Mary went to the post office to send her gift to her match.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Mary would send her gift through the mail or a delivery service rather than hand-delivering it herself. Going to the store for a makeup kit or putting rattlesnakes in the gift-box are not appropriate actions for a secret santa exchange."}}
{"Q": "Bill wouldn't stop playing violent video games around his son. Which event could cause Bill reluctantly stopped playing the games?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) One day his boy bashed his friend over the head with a rock. (B) Bill saw his son reenact a violent sex scene.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bill would stop playing violent video games around his son if his son actually acted out violently, such as bashing someone over the head with a rock. This would likely cause Bill to realize the negative impact that the games could have on his son's behavior and make him reconsider his actions. On the other hand, reenacting a violent sex scene is a less likely scenario and may not have as strong of an impact on Bill's behavior."}}
{"Q": "Trish was happy to have both of her daughter's home at once. Which event could cause Trish went to bed very happy that night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Trish had seen one of her daughters recently since she was off to college. (B) Trish had not seen one of her daughters in a long time since she was off to college.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Trish had not seen one of her daughters in a long time since she was off to college, it would be a bigger reason for her to be happy to have both of her daughters home at once. The fact that both of her daughters were home together after a long time would make her feel more complete and happy."}}
{"Q": "We gathered for the office Christmas party. Which event could cause The night was a great time and everyone was happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Everybody exchanged birthday presents. (B) We worked hard to prepare for the party.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Working hard to prepare for the party would create a sense of accomplishment and excitement for the event. This would likely lead to a fun and enjoyable night for everyone, resulting in happiness and a great time. Exchanging birthday presents, while a nice gesture, would not necessarily contribute to the overall success and enjoyment of the Christmas party."}}
{"Q": "Billy's family just moved to a new city. Which event could cause They became great friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bill instantly made friends with the neighbor that lived three houses down. (B) Billy met his neighbor Jimmy on his last day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Billy becoming instant friends with a neighbor who lives close by would lead to a strong friendship, rather than meeting someone on his last day in the city. Building a friendship takes time and consistent interaction, which is more likely to happen with a neighbor who lives nearby."}}
{"Q": "Larry was playing basketball. Which event could cause The river carried his basketball all the way down the stream?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He dropped the basketball and it rolled down the hill. (B) It began to snow heavily, and soon the park was covered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Larry dropped the basketball and it rolled down the hill, it could easily end up in a nearby river or stream and be carried away by the current. On the other hand, snowfall would not have a direct impact on the basketball's location unless it caused a flood or avalanche, which is not mentioned in the given information. Therefore, option A is a more plausible event that could cause the basketball to end up in the river."}}
{"Q": "Anna was babysitting her young cousins. Which event could cause Anna kept them amused all day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anna brought a bag filled with arts and crafts. (B) Anna made funny faces at the dogs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Anna brought a bag filled with arts and crafts.\nExplanation: Bringing a bag filled with arts and crafts is a more plausible answer as it provides a variety of activities for the children to engage in and keeps them occupied for a longer period of time. Making funny faces at the dogs may be entertaining for a short while, but it is not a sustainable activity to keep the children amused all day."}}
{"Q": "I was talking to my neighbor this morning. Which event could cause The cat had been following me and got inside my house?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I didn't notice the deceased cat outside while I was talking. (B) I left my neighbors gate open.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I left my neighbors gate open.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the cat got inside the house because the neighbor's gate was left open, rather than the presence of a deceased cat outside. Cats are curious animals and may wander into open spaces, so an open gate would provide an easy opportunity for the cat to follow the speaker and enter their house."}}
{"Q": "Joann was making lemon cupcakes. Which event could cause They came out with an awkward texture?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joan added too much baking soda. (B) Joann forgot to add baking soda.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Joann added too much baking soda.\nExplanation: Baking soda is a leavening agent that helps cupcakes rise and become fluffy. However, if too much baking soda is added, it can cause the cupcakes to rise too quickly and then collapse, resulting in a dense and awkward texture. Forgetting to add baking soda would result in flat and dense cupcakes, but not necessarily an awkward texture. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Every Wednesday Mark was at the baseball fields. Which event could cause Mark never ate a hotdog again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mark loved hotdogs, but he was losing too much weight. (B) Mark got food poisoning from a hotdog at the ballpark.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Mark got food poisoning from a hotdog at the ballpark.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Mark's regular activity of being at the baseball fields on Wednesdays and his potential consumption of hotdogs at the ballpark. It also provides a clear reason for why Mark would never eat a hotdog again. Option (A) does not provide a clear reason for why Mark would stop eating hotdogs and seems less likely to be the cause."}}
{"Q": "My trumpet teacher was amazing. Which event could cause All of his examples were really funny?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He gave very serious instructions for everything he taught. (B) He gave explicit instructions for everything he taught.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the trumpet teacher gave very serious instructions for everything he taught, it is possible that he used humor as a way to lighten the mood and make the lessons more enjoyable. This could have led to him using funny examples to help his students remember important concepts. On the other hand, if he gave explicit instructions for everything he taught, it is less likely that he would have used humor in his examples."}}
{"Q": "My son told me about making a little extra money in my spare time. Which event could cause Now I turk almost every day and am making a lot of extra money?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My son said it was called Mechanical Turk and it's run by Amazon so I know it's legitimate. (B) He hooked me down with a turk job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it shows that the person did their research and found out that Mechanical Turk is a legitimate platform run by Amazon. It also implies that the person took the initiative to start working on the platform regularly, leading to their increased earnings. Option B is less plausible because it doesn't provide any information about the platform or how the person started working on it. It also uses slang language (\"hooked me down\") which makes it less professional."}}
{"Q": "I forgot to set my alarm last night. Which event could cause Luckily I'm a good worker and got one more chance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was early for work this morning. (B) I ended up being late to work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I was early for work this morning.\nExplanation: If the person is a good worker and got one more chance, it is more likely that they woke up early and made it to work on time, rather than being late. Being early shows responsibility and dedication to their job, which aligns with the statement that they are a good worker."}}
{"Q": "Pat really hated Ben. Which event could cause Now Ben will never wear gloves again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Pat started wearing gloves as winter set in. (B) Ben slapped Pat with a glove.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Ben slapped Pat with a glove.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause Ben to never wear gloves again because it involves a negative interaction between Pat and Ben. If Pat started wearing gloves, it would not necessarily have any impact on Ben's decision to wear gloves. However, if Ben was physically assaulted with a glove by Pat, it could create a negative association with gloves and cause him to avoid wearing them in the future."}}
{"Q": "I put the black plastic rose in a vase with water. Which event could cause Honestly, I didn't really know why either?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was thinking about other things and didn't realize I didn't do it yet. (B) My friend asked me why I put a plastic rose in the vase.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that the person simply forgot to remove the plastic rose from the vase before adding water, rather than being prompted by a friend's question. This is a common mistake that can happen when one is distracted or preoccupied with other thoughts."}}
{"Q": "Ron and his friends were hanging out late at night. Which event could cause Ron said he didn't want to and his friends made fun of him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ron decided to go home so he could rest before work the next day. (B) Ron's friends dared Ron to stay inside.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Ron's friends dared Ron to stay inside.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Ron's friends would make fun of him if he refused to do something they dared him to do, rather than if he decided to go home to rest before work. Additionally, the fact that they were hanging out late at night suggests that they were looking for something to do, making it more plausible that they would dare Ron to stay inside."}}
{"Q": "Jim wanted a new kitchen sink. Which event could cause Then he took some time to admire his new sink?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim went to the night club. (B) Jim hired a plumber to install a farmhouse sink.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Jim hired a plumber to install a farmhouse sink.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jim would take time to admire his new sink after having it installed by a professional rather than going to a night club, which has no connection to getting a new sink."}}
{"Q": "My husband Jim died of cancer last year on Valentine's Day. Which event could cause Her loving father left a final love letter in their favorite book?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim wanted to leave his wife a lasting memento. (B) My daughter moved out of her room.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Jim wanted to leave his wife a lasting memento.\nExplanation: Given the context of the question, it is more plausible that the event of Jim's death would lead to him wanting to leave his wife a lasting memento, such as a love letter, rather than the event of the daughter moving out of her room. Additionally, the mention of the husband's death on Valentine's Day suggests a strong emotional connection between the couple, making it more likely that he would want to leave a final love letter as a way to express his love and provide comfort to his wife after his passing."}}
{"Q": "Garth woke up and pounded the alarm clock into silence. Which event could cause He called 911, but there wasn't anything they could do?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Garth felt something cold next to him. (B) Garth broke his phone and didn't know the time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Garth may have woken up to find something unexpected or alarming next to him, which could have caused him to panic and call 911. Option B, on the other hand, is less likely to cause such a reaction as Garth could simply check the time on another device or clock."}}
{"Q": "Mark wrote horror stories for a living, and he took great pride in it. Which event could cause Mark woke up to the sound of his alarm clock in tears?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He fell asleep by accident before he finished his story in time. (B) Mark's stories gave him nightmares.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Mark's profession is writing horror stories, so it is unlikely that his own stories would give him nightmares. However, if he fell asleep before finishing his story in time, he may have missed a deadline or lost a potential opportunity, causing him to wake up in tears."}}
{"Q": "I stopped taking my prescribed pills because they made sick. Which event could cause I told the doctor his pills made me sick so i stopped taking them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I went to the doctor to discuss my pills. (B) I missed my appointment with my doctor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I went to the doctor to discuss my pills.\nExplanation: If the pills were prescribed by a doctor, it is important to inform them if they are causing any adverse effects. The most plausible event that would lead to informing the doctor about the side effects and discontinuing the medication would be going to the doctor to discuss the pills. Missing an appointment would not necessarily lead to informing the doctor about the side effects."}}
{"Q": "Tim was struggling in math. Which event could cause Ultimately, he ended up failing the test and had to repeat the course?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Instead of asking for help, Tim went to a football game with his friends the night before the final exam. (B) Tim studied every night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Instead of asking for help, Tim went to a football game with his friends the night before the final exam.\nExplanation: This event could cause Tim to fail the test and repeat the course because he chose to prioritize socializing with his friends over studying and seeking help for his struggles in math. By not addressing his difficulties and not adequately preparing for the final exam, Tim put himself in a position to fail."}}
{"Q": "The girls went to a bar. Which event could cause They went home talking about their night?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The girls enjoyed the bar. (B) They had a great time dancing until the morning.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the girls had a great time dancing until the morning, it is more likely that they would go home talking about their night. Enjoying the bar could mean different things, such as enjoying the drinks or the atmosphere, but it does not necessarily imply that they had a memorable experience worth discussing. Dancing until the morning, on the other hand, is a specific and exciting activity that would likely leave a lasting impression on the girls."}}
{"Q": "Jo went up to the rooftop to work on her tan. Which event could cause The landlord heard her pounding and found Jo shivering on the roof?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She stayed out all day and when night came she went inside. (B) Jo accidentally got locked on top of the roof and started knocking on the door for help.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jo accidentally got locked on top of the roof and started knocking on the door for help.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it explains why Jo was pounding on the roof and why she was shivering. If Jo had stayed out all day and went inside at night, she would not have been locked on the roof and would not have needed to knock on the door for help. Additionally, if she had been on the roof all day, she would have had plenty of time to work on her tan and would not have been shivering."}}
{"Q": "Bob is surprised when his truck breaks down on the highway. Which event could cause The officer even gives Bob a ride to a car rental company?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) he thoought they would find it odd he was in middle of road. (B) A police officer stops in the park to help Bob.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer as it suggests that a police officer stopped to help Bob and even gave him a ride to a car rental company. This is a common scenario where police officers assist stranded motorists on the highway. Option A is less likely as it is not clear why Bob's presence on the road would be odd, especially if he had pulled over to the side of the road."}}
{"Q": "I've always wanted to be able to bike thirty miles at one time. Which event could cause I am so out of shape I can't even bike a mile?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I have not been riding or working out though. (B) I have been riding and working out every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If someone has not been riding or working out, it is more plausible that they would be out of shape and unable to bike even a mile. Lack of exercise and physical activity can lead to a decrease in cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength, making it difficult to complete physical tasks such as biking. On the other hand, if someone has been riding and working out every day, it is less likely that they would be unable to bike a mile, as their physical fitness level would likely be higher."}}
{"Q": "Jacob woke up at a red light. Which event could cause Now Jacob only wakes up in his bed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) he fell asleep in the car. (B) Jacob vowed to never drive drunk again.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jacob fell asleep in the car and woke up at a red light rather than suddenly vowing to never drive drunk again and magically only waking up in his bed."}}
{"Q": "Bella was very pale. Which event could cause When she left, her skin was a summery golden brown?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she decided to take a much needed vacation in florida. (B) Bella decided to save the morning at the nail salon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. she decided to take a much needed vacation in Florida.\nExplanation: Exposure to the sun can cause the skin to tan and turn a golden brown color. If Bella spent time in Florida, which is known for its sunny weather, it is plausible that she would have gotten a tan and her skin would have turned from pale to golden brown. On the other hand, going to a nail salon would not cause a significant change in skin color."}}
{"Q": "Cathy was happy that she finally had some time to sew. Which event could cause Cathy tapped her metal fingertips on the table in frustration?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cathy put the thimbles on. (B) Cathy could not get the thread into the fabric.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Cathy could not get the thread into the fabric.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Cathy would tap her metal fingertips on the table in frustration if she was having difficulty getting the thread into the fabric, rather than simply putting on thimbles. Putting on thimbles is a routine part of sewing and would not likely cause frustration."}}
{"Q": "My grandmother made key lime pie. Which event could cause I went to the bathroom to spit it out?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I hated the pie. (B) I devoured the pie.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I hated the pie.\nExplanation: If someone hates the taste of a food, they may feel the need to spit it out or have a negative physical reaction to it. In this case, the strong and tart flavor of key lime pie may have been too much for the person to handle, causing them to go to the bathroom to spit it out."}}
{"Q": "Ned needed cigarettes - he was almost out. Which event could cause He bought himself two whole cartons of cigarettes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ned decided it was time to quit smoking and did so cold turkey. (B) Ned saw a great deal at the wholesale club.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Ned saw a great deal at the wholesale club.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it provides a logical reason for why Ned would buy two whole cartons of cigarettes. If he had decided to quit smoking cold turkey, he wouldn't have bought any cigarettes at all. However, if he saw a great deal at the wholesale club, it would make sense for him to stock up on cigarettes while they were on sale."}}
{"Q": "My friends were taking me rock climbing. Which event could cause The next day, I went to the real rock wall and climbed it very well?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They wanted to start with a real rock wall for practice first. (B) We went to the gym to practice on a fake wall.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the friends would take the narrator to a gym to practice on a fake wall before attempting a real rock wall. This would allow the narrator to become familiar with the equipment and techniques before facing the challenges of a real rock wall."}}
{"Q": "I went to the beach last summer to try to get a tan. Which event could cause I woke up with massive sunburn all over my body?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I fell asleep and didn't put more sunscreen on. (B) I fell asleep in the shade.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the person fell asleep and didn't put more sunscreen on, they would have been exposed to the sun's harmful rays for an extended period of time without protection, leading to a high likelihood of getting sunburned. Falling asleep in the shade would provide some protection from the sun, making it less likely to result in massive sunburn all over the body."}}
{"Q": "Kelly couldn't wait to go to Sephora for the first time to buy makeup. Which event could cause By the time she left the store, Kelly had about 12 different bags ful?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The saleslady knew Kelly was going to be an easy sale. (B) She couldn't believe how few choices she had.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The saleslady knew Kelly was going to be an easy sale.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the saleslady recognized Kelly's excitement and eagerness to buy makeup, and therefore suggested multiple products to her, resulting in Kelly purchasing a large amount of items. Option B does not make sense as Sephora is known for having a wide variety of makeup choices."}}
{"Q": "Television is a scary thing. Which event could cause I made a sandwich to satisfy my craving?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) One advertisement made me crave a sandwich. (B) I watched a show about scary things found around the world.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that an advertisement for a sandwich would make someone crave a sandwich, rather than watching a scary show. While watching a scary show may increase anxiety or stress levels, it is unlikely to directly cause a craving for a sandwich. On the other hand, advertisements are designed to create desire for products, and it is common for food advertisements to make viewers hungry or crave certain foods."}}
{"Q": "One day Adam bought two BB guns. Which event could cause Adam was very proud of Christian?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Christian shot at Adam with the gun. (B) Adam gave one to Christian.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that Adam would be proud of Christian if he gave him one of the BB guns, showing trust and generosity. If Christian shot at Adam with the gun, it would likely cause conflict and negative feelings, rather than pride."}}
{"Q": "We attended a Halloween Which event could cause The host was scandalized?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The host boyfriend proposed to her in front of everyone. (B) The host had too much to drink and flirted with someone who was not his wife.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The host had too much to drink and flirted with someone who was not his wife.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it involves inappropriate behavior at a Halloween party, which could potentially scandalize the host. On the other hand, a marriage proposal at a Halloween party may be seen as romantic or sweet, rather than scandalous."}}
{"Q": "Everyone in my family got together for Thanksgiving. Which event could cause We had a great time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People drove in from all over the state. (B) Everyone was angry and didn't eat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: People drove in from all over the state.\nExplanation: If everyone in the family got together for Thanksgiving, it is likely that people had to travel to be there. The fact that they made the effort to come from all over the state suggests that they were looking forward to spending time together and enjoying the holiday. Therefore, it is more plausible that this event would cause them to have a great time. On the other hand, if everyone was angry and didn't eat, it is unlikely that they would have had a great time."}}
{"Q": "Joe loved his beard. Which event could cause He decided to shave it and he got a job instantly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe was having a hard time picking a job. (B) Joe couldn't get hired because his beard looked unprofessional.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Joe couldn't get hired because his beard looked unprofessional.\nExplanation: Many workplaces have grooming standards that require employees to maintain a clean-shaven appearance or keep their facial hair neatly trimmed. If Joe was having a hard time getting hired because his beard looked unprofessional, he may have decided to shave it in order to increase his chances of finding a job. It's possible that after shaving, he was able to secure a job more easily because he now met the grooming standards of potential employers."}}
{"Q": "Ben decided to treat himself to a coffee. Which event could cause Ben was frustrated at the extra charge?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ben was charged extra for a cup. (B) The worker charged him double.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ben would be frustrated at being charged extra for a cup, as this is a common practice in some coffee shops. Being charged double by the worker is less likely and may be seen as an error or mistake, rather than an intentional extra charge."}}
{"Q": "Joe had recently graduated from college. Which event could cause He had to get a part-time job delivering pizzas to support himself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe  have  money. (B) The job market was bad.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The job market was bad.\nExplanation: It is common for recent college graduates to struggle to find a job in their field, especially during a tough job market. If there are not many job opportunities available, Joe may have had to take a part-time job delivering pizzas to make ends meet until he can find a job in his desired field. Option (A) is unlikely as it contradicts the fact that Joe had to get a part-time job to support himself."}}
{"Q": "Al loved sad music. Which event could cause As soon as he saw the tear he asked her to be his wife?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Al saw a woman at the grocery store crying when a sad song came on over the PA system. (B) Al's girlfriend cried during a sad song.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Al's girlfriend crying during a sad song would lead him to propose, as they have a personal connection and emotional bond. Seeing a stranger cry in a grocery store may not have the same impact on Al's emotions and decision-making."}}
{"Q": "Lois hated math. Which event could cause She was wrong and quit within a month?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lois challenged herself by enrolling in a math class. (B) Lois thought tutoring would kill her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lois challenged herself by enrolling in a math class.\nExplanation: If Lois hated math, enrolling in a math class would be a challenge for her. However, if she was willing to take on the challenge, it shows that she may have been motivated to improve her math skills. If she quit within a month, it could be because she found the class too difficult or overwhelming, which would be a more plausible reason than simply thinking tutoring would kill her (option B)."}}
{"Q": "I was walking home. Which event could cause The rain made me feel even more depressed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was a sunny day. (B) I was depressed because my girlfriend broke up with me. halfway through my walk it started to rain.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I was depressed because my girlfriend broke up with me. \nExplanation: The event of the breakup already had the person feeling down, and the rain could have added to their negative emotions and made them feel even more depressed. The contrast between the gloomy weather and their mood could have intensified their feelings. On a sunny day, the rain may not have had the same effect on their emotions."}}
{"Q": "Alex needed groceries. Which event could cause Alex bought a yacht?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She saw an advertisement for a car at the store. (B) She decided to go to a store and look at boats on her way grocery shopping.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She decided to go to a store and look at boats on her way grocery shopping.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alex would buy a yacht if she intentionally went to a store to look at boats, rather than randomly seeing an advertisement for a car at the grocery store and deciding to buy a yacht instead of groceries."}}
{"Q": "I wanted a pet for my birthday. Which event could cause I drove home with the mini pig in my car?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My father gave me a bat instead. (B) I went to buy exotic pet with my father.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the person went to buy an exotic pet with their father, it is possible that they could have come across a mini pig and decided to bring it home as their birthday present. However, if their father gave them a bat instead, it is highly unlikely that they would have ended up with a mini pig in their car."}}
{"Q": "The teacher told Diana that she's failing the class. Which event could cause She ended up with a 33 on the exam?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Diana decided to study with her friends instead of go out. (B) Diana decided she didn't care and didn't study for the exam.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Diana decided she didn't care and didn't study for the exam.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Diana's lack of effort and preparation for the exam resulted in her low score and ultimately failing the class. Studying with friends may have actually been beneficial for her, but choosing not to study at all would have a much greater impact on her performance."}}
{"Q": "There were two powerful families. Which event could cause The Lance's ended up winning the war and took over?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The Funkel's won every battle, year after year. (B) the families had a fight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The Funkel's won every battle, year after year.\nExplanation: If one family consistently wins every battle, it is likely that they will eventually win the war and take over. This would give them the upper hand in terms of resources, territory, and morale, making it difficult for the opposing family to continue fighting. On the other hand, a single fight between the families may not necessarily determine the outcome of the war, as there could be multiple battles and factors at play."}}
{"Q": "Young Myron was used to being the center of his parents' lives. Which event could cause Myron realized there were good parts to being a big brother too?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Myron was not happy his parents were having a baby. (B) One day, Myron's parents said a new couch was on the way.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Myron was not happy his parents were having a baby.\nExplanation: If Myron was not happy about his parents having a baby, he may have initially felt left out or jealous of the attention the new baby was receiving. However, as he adjusted to the new family dynamic, he may have realized the joys and responsibilities of being a big brother, such as helping take care of the baby and being a role model. This realization could have led him to see the good parts of being a big brother. On the other hand, the arrival of a new couch (option B) is unlikely to have any significant impact on Myron's perception of being a big brother."}}
{"Q": "Amy awoke to see the sun was shining bright in the fall. Which event could cause Amy loved that beautiful fall day that felt like summer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy spent her day outside in the nice weather. (B) Amy stayed in the house all day long.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Amy spent her day outside in the nice weather.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Amy would love the beautiful fall day that felt like summer if she spent her day outside enjoying the nice weather. If she stayed inside all day, she may not have even noticed the weather or had the opportunity to appreciate it."}}
{"Q": "Terry was going through a big issue. Which event could cause He never would budge?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Terry and his wife wanted the same paint for their house. (B) Terry stood strong on his views.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement \"Terry never would budge\" implies that he was very firm in his beliefs and unwilling to compromise. Option B, which states that Terry stood strong on his views, is the most plausible event that could cause him to never budge. Option A, which is about choosing paint for a house, does not seem significant enough to cause such a strong reaction from Terry."}}
{"Q": "Quinton was getting evicted from his apartment. Which event could cause Quinton felt depressed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Quinton packed up his bags, and started looking for a new place. (B) Quinton could not find another apartment to move into.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Quinton could not find another apartment to move into.\nExplanation: This event could cause Quinton to feel depressed because he is being forced to leave his current living situation and if he is unable to find another place to live, he may feel hopeless and overwhelmed. The stress of not having a place to live can also lead to feelings of anxiety and depression. Packing up his bags and looking for a new place may be stressful, but it is a proactive step towards finding a solution, whereas not being able to find a new place can feel like a dead end."}}
{"Q": "Adam hired a maid to clean his house. Which event could cause The agency dismissed the thief at once?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The maid stole his silverware from the house. (B) That day Adam's house was robbed by the neighbor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The maid stealing silverware from the house is a plausible reason for the agency to dismiss her immediately. It shows that she cannot be trusted and poses a risk to the safety and security of the household. On the other hand, the neighbor robbing Adam's house has nothing to do with the maid's behavior and would not be a valid reason for her dismissal."}}
{"Q": "Dave's parents have a restaurant. Which event could cause They decided to close the business?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They are getting more customers. (B) Dave's restaurant was no longer doing well.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Dave's restaurant was no longer doing well, it could lead to financial difficulties and ultimately the decision to close the business. On the other hand, getting more customers would typically be a positive development that would encourage them to keep the business open."}}
{"Q": "Robbie struggled to hold his pencil correctly. Which event could cause Robbie, his teacher, and his mother were all thrilled when it worked?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Robbie finally got it right. (B) They did not know how to help him hold the pencil easier.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Robbie finally got it right.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Robbie, his teacher, and his mother would be thrilled if Robbie finally succeeded in holding his pencil correctly, rather than them not knowing how to help him. If Robbie was able to hold his pencil correctly, it would be a significant achievement for him and a sign of progress in his development."}}
{"Q": "Jed was making a stew. Which event could cause Jed regretted he hadn't just had a bowl of cereal?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He ate some cereal in the meantime. (B) Jed burned the stew.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jed burned the stew, it would be ruined and he would have to start over or settle for a less-than-ideal meal. This could cause him to regret not just having a simple bowl of cereal instead. Eating some cereal in the meantime would not necessarily cause regret, as it could just be a snack or a way to hold him over until the stew is ready."}}
{"Q": "Annie accidentally slept in. Which event could cause Since she didn't have time, her hair ended up looking too messy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Annie had to jump up and rush to class before she was late. (B) She took her time brush her hair that night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Annie had to jump up and rush to class before she was late, she wouldn't have had time to properly brush her hair, leading to it looking messy. On the other hand, if she took her time brushing her hair the night before, it wouldn't have affected how her hair looked in the morning when she woke up late."}}
{"Q": "Nik was dating Jess. Which event could cause So Nick decided to propose to her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nik loved his girlfriend very much. (B) Nick and Jess had a horrible relationship.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Nik loved his girlfriend very much.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Nik decided to propose to Jess because he loved her very much and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. A strong and loving relationship is usually the reason why people decide to get engaged and eventually married. On the other hand, if Nick and Jess had a horrible relationship, it is unlikely that he would propose to her."}}
{"Q": "Jordan was wandering through the desert on his camel. Which event could cause Jordan realized he was lost, and drank his last drops of water?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) jordan didn't pack survival gear very well. (B) Jordan was getting hungry, but couldnt find water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jordan was getting hungry but couldn't find water, it is more likely that he would realize he was lost and drink his last drops of water. If he didn't pack survival gear very well, he may have run out of water earlier or not had enough to begin with, but it wouldn't necessarily mean he was lost."}}
{"Q": "Cora always wanted to take a cruise. Which event could cause Three weeks later Cora was finally enjoying the ocean breeze?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cora planned the cruise in the later years. (B) during vacation holiday cora travel on a boat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) during vacation holiday Cora traveled on a boat.\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it suggests that Cora's desire to take a cruise was fulfilled during a vacation holiday. It is common for people to take cruises during their vacations, and it makes sense that Cora would finally have the opportunity to do so after planning and saving up for it. Option A, on the other hand, does not provide a clear explanation of how Cora was able to take a cruise three weeks later."}}
{"Q": "James went to the bistro to meet some friends. Which event could cause They finally left and everyone was relieved at James' bravery?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) James fought off a pack of dogs. (B) James never got in a fight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If James fought off a pack of dogs, it would be a brave and heroic act that would likely cause his friends to feel relieved and impressed. On the other hand, if James never got in a fight, there would be no reason for his friends to feel relieved at his bravery."}}
{"Q": "Derek has an interview for a job. Which event could cause He doesn't get the job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Derek did not prepare or dress nice. (B) Derek's interview went very well.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Derek did not prepare or dress nice.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Derek not preparing or dressing appropriately for the interview would negatively impact his chances of getting the job. Even if his interview went well, a lack of preparation or professionalism could leave a negative impression on the interviewer and ultimately cost him the job."}}
{"Q": "Sam was swimming at the pool. Which event could cause Sam stayed out since he was already wet?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam got into the pool. (B) Sam got out and dried himself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sam got out and dried himself.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sam would get out of the pool and dry himself off if he wanted to stay out of the water, rather than getting into the pool and staying wet."}}
{"Q": "My friends and I were playing outside. Which event could cause We put the gear away and went our separate ways?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We got into a fight. (B) Suddenly it started shining heavily.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Suddenly it started shining heavily.\nExplanation: If it started shining heavily, it could indicate that a storm or heavy rain was approaching, which would make it necessary to put away any gear and seek shelter. Getting into a fight would not necessarily require putting away gear, and it is less likely to cause the group to go their separate ways immediately."}}
{"Q": "Sandy's mom packed her a ham sandwich for lunch again. Which event could cause The were both happy with the trade?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Molly didn't like her tuna so she traded with Sandy. (B) Sandy's favorite sandwich was ham.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Sandy was able to trade her unwanted sandwich for a sandwich she actually likes. Option B only suggests that Sandy likes ham sandwiches, but it doesn't explain why her mom packing her a ham sandwich would make them both happy."}}
{"Q": "I bought a backup drive for my wife's iPhone, using Amazon. Which event could cause I thanked Amazon for their great customer service?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) the iphone came fast. (B) Amazon asked me immediately to buy another item.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The prompt mentions that the individual bought a backup drive for their wife's iPhone, so the speed of delivery would be a crucial factor in their satisfaction with Amazon's customer service. Additionally, the prompt does not mention anything about Amazon asking the individual to buy another item, so option B is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Deena was walking home one cold day. Which event could cause The dog seemed sick so she took it home and kept it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Deena saw a little dog outside. (B) Deena saw a little turtle outside.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Deena saw a little dog outside.\nExplanation: Seeing a sick dog outside on a cold day is a more plausible reason for Deena to take it home and care for it than seeing a turtle. Turtles are not typically kept as pets and are not commonly found wandering outside in cold weather. On the other hand, dogs are often kept as pets and can become sick or lost if left outside in cold weather."}}
{"Q": "Tom and his wife Diane had just had their first child. Which event could cause He woke his wife to tell her, she then broke the news to him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Diane had the baby stay with their grandparents one night and didn't tell Tom. (B) They both decided together they wanted a divorce.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Diane had the baby stay with their grandparents one night and didn't tell Tom, as this is a common scenario for new parents to have a night off and leave the baby with trusted family members. On the other hand, it is unlikely that they would both decide together they wanted a divorce immediately after having their first child."}}
{"Q": "Kellen needed to find a better job. Which event could cause He is forever grateful to his friend for getting him the job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His friend Charlie had an opening at the bar. (B) Kellen's friend got him a lower paying sales job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. His friend Charlie had an opening at the bar.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kellen would be grateful to his friend for getting him a job at a bar, which could potentially pay better with tips, rather than a lower paying sales job. Additionally, the fact that there was an opening at the bar suggests that Kellen was actively seeking employment and his friend was able to help him secure a job."}}
{"Q": "Tom was listening to music in class. Which event could cause So Tom didn't know they weren't going to pick him up from school?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's cell phone rang, an he answered the call. (B) Tom didn't hear the message his teacher gave him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom didn't hear the message his teacher gave him.\nExplanation: If Tom was listening to music in class, it is likely that he had headphones on or the volume was turned up high, which could have prevented him from hearing the message his teacher gave him about not being picked up from school. On the other hand, if Tom's cell phone rang, he would have had to take off his headphones and stop listening to music in order to answer the call, which would have made him aware of the situation. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Neil was a music lover. Which event could cause Neil thought Vienna was the most musical city on earth?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When Neil saved his money, he went to Austria. (B) Neil traveled to Vienna because of its great art.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since Neil was a music lover, it is more plausible that he would travel to Vienna because of its reputation as a musical city rather than for its art. Additionally, the fact that he saved his money specifically to go to Austria suggests that he had a specific reason for wanting to visit Vienna, such as attending concerts or visiting famous music venues."}}
{"Q": "Ed was making whiskey at home. Which event could cause Sampling it, Ed decided his whiskey was great?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Whiskey was Ed's favorite drink. (B) Ed was nervous about how it would come out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Ed was nervous about how it would come out.\nExplanation: If Ed was nervous about how his whiskey would turn out, it is more likely that he would sample it to see if it was good or not. On the other hand, if whiskey was already Ed's favorite drink, he may have already had high expectations for his homemade whiskey and may not have needed to sample it to know it was great."}}
{"Q": "Susan noticed that her feet were really swollen. Which event could cause After a few days she noticed that the swelling in her feet had gone d?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Susan was six months pregnant. (B) She talked to her doctor and gave them some advice.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Susan was six months pregnant.\nExplanation: Swelling in the feet is a common symptom during pregnancy due to the increased pressure on the veins in the lower body. As the pregnancy progresses, the body retains more fluid, which can cause swelling in the feet and ankles. After a few days, the swelling may go down on its own or with some rest and elevation of the feet. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer. Option B is not a likely cause as simply talking to a doctor would not necessarily lead to the swelling going down."}}
{"Q": "Beth had been getting a lot of sore throats. Which event could cause She enjoyed the relaxation and ice cream in the meantime?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She ended up having surgery to remove her leg. (B) Beth eventually had her tonsils out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Beth eventually had her tonsils out.\nExplanation: Sore throats are a common symptom of tonsillitis, which is inflammation of the tonsils. If Beth had been experiencing frequent sore throats, it is possible that her doctor recommended she have her tonsils removed to prevent further infections. Surgery to remove a leg would not be related to sore throats, so option A is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Charlie was driving to his friend's house in his new car. Which event could cause He declined and followed street laws like a responsible car owner?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Another driver challenged him to drag race. (B) Charlies friend wanted him to slow down and get there later.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Charlies friend wanted him to slow down and get there later.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Charlie would decline to drag race and follow street laws if his friend asked him to slow down and arrive later. Friends often look out for each other's safety and well-being, and it is responsible to follow traffic laws to avoid accidents and tickets. Drag racing is also illegal and dangerous, so it is unlikely that Charlie would engage in such behavior in his new car."}}
{"Q": "Cornelia had always loved working with her hands. Which event could cause Cornelia chopped the table up for firewood?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Cornelia needed firewood for her fireplace. (B) Cornelia needed firewood but had run out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Cornelia needed firewood but had run out.\nExplanation: Since Cornelia loved working with her hands, it is unlikely that she would chop up a table for firewood unless she had no other option. Option B suggests that she had run out of firewood, which would be a more plausible reason for her to resort to using a table for firewood. Option A suggests that she already had firewood and chopped up the table unnecessarily."}}
{"Q": "A man made a wishing well next to his mailbox. Which event could cause He paid for the entire meal in change?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The change filled up with wishing wells. (B) Every person who walked by tossed in a coin.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Every person who walked by tossed in a coin.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that people walking by the mailbox and seeing the wishing well would toss in a coin, rather than the change from paying for a meal filling up the wishing well."}}
{"Q": "Sam was excited, the day was finally here. Which event could cause Sam decided that a wedding pie would have to suffice?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam almost dropped the wedding cake. (B) Sam got news that his wedding cake got ruined.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Sam got news that his wedding cake got ruined, it would be a plausible reason for him to decide that a wedding pie would have to suffice. On the other hand, almost dropping the wedding cake may cause Sam to be more careful with it, but it wouldn't necessarily lead to him choosing a different dessert option."}}
{"Q": "Joe ordered a dining room set off of the internet for his wife. Which event could cause Joe had ordered doll furniture by mistake?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe did not read the website correctly. (B) When Joe unpacked the furniture he realized it was too fancy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Joe did not read the website correctly.\nExplanation: If Joe did not read the website correctly, he may have accidentally ordered doll furniture instead of a dining room set. This is a common mistake that can happen when people do not carefully read the product descriptions or accidentally click on the wrong item. On the other hand, if Joe unpacked the furniture and realized it was too fancy, it is unlikely that he would mistake it for doll furniture."}}
{"Q": "Jacob was driving home from work. Which event could cause He felt really good knowing his help was so appreciated?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He stopped to help someone deflating a flat tire. (B) Jacob stopped to help someone fix a tire.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Helping someone with a flat tire is a kind and helpful act that could make Jacob feel good about himself and his actions. The fact that the person appreciated his help would only add to his positive feelings. Helping someone fix a tire could also make Jacob feel good, but the specific mention of appreciation in the question suggests that option A is the more likely scenario."}}
{"Q": "Ann was my date to our elementary school graduation party. Which event could cause Suddenly she leaped across the car seat and planted a kiss on my lips?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She is not my favorite since childhood. (B) I drove Ann home from the party.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I drove Ann home from the party.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Ann would feel comfortable enough to kiss the speaker if they were alone in the car together, rather than in a crowded party where they may not have had much one-on-one time. Additionally, the fact that the speaker drove Ann home suggests that they may have had a closer relationship or connection than if they had just been classmates at the party."}}
{"Q": "Robbie just joined a new band. Which event could cause They record a record together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They ruin a lot of songs. (B) Robbie has a bandmate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Robbie has a bandmate.\nExplanation: In order to record a record, a band typically needs to have multiple members who can play different instruments and contribute to the songwriting process. Therefore, it is more plausible that the fact that Robbie has joined a new band with other members would lead to them recording a record together, rather than them ruining a lot of songs."}}
{"Q": "Tom wanted to take Shelly on a date. Which event could cause They both just sat and watched the sunset together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom and Shelly went up to the beach. (B) Tom took her to a hilltop picnic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom took her to a hilltop picnic.\nExplanation: A hilltop picnic is a romantic setting where couples can enjoy each other's company while watching the sunset. It is a more plausible scenario for Tom and Shelly to sit and watch the sunset together rather than just going up to the beach."}}
{"Q": "Dave loved the outdoors. Which event could cause Dave took pictures of the tall trees?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The weather was beautiful. (B) The weather was raining hard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The weather was beautiful.\nExplanation: Dave loved the outdoors, so it is more likely that he would take pictures of the tall trees when the weather was beautiful and he could fully appreciate the scenery. If the weather was raining hard, it would be less likely that Dave would want to take pictures outside."}}
{"Q": "Cindy came down sick. Which event could cause Cindy started taking it that nigh?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her mother bought her some cough medicine. (B) Her mother bought her some candy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Her mother bought her some cough medicine.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Cindy started taking cough medicine because she was sick, rather than candy causing her to become sick. Cough medicine is a common remedy for cold and flu symptoms, and it is plausible that Cindy's mother bought it for her to help alleviate her symptoms."}}
{"Q": "Jeremy had a huge test at school. Which event could cause Suddenly, his teacher woke him up and made him finish the test?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jeremy fell asleep at his desk at home while studying. (B) Jeremy was so tired he fell asleep during the test!.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jeremy was so tired he fell asleep during the test!\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it directly relates to the test that Jeremy had to take. Falling asleep during the test would cause him to not finish it, and his teacher waking him up to finish it would make sense in this scenario. Falling asleep while studying at home would not necessarily have the same consequence of needing to be woken up by the teacher to finish the test."}}
{"Q": "Tara wanted to repaint her room. Which event could cause She went home and painted her room pink by herself?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tara wanted a more comfortable room. (B) Tara bought the blue paint that she saw at the store.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tara bought the blue paint that she saw at the store.\nExplanation: This event is more directly related to Tara actually painting her room. If Tara wanted a more comfortable room, she may have chosen a different color or made other changes besides just painting. However, buying blue paint and then using it to paint her room pink shows a clear cause-and-effect relationship."}}
{"Q": "Allie didn't own many purses, but was attached to the few she had. Which event could cause She missed her old purse, but began to love the new one just as much?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her mom gave her a new one for her birthday and she sold it. (B) Unfortunately she lost one of hers and bought a new one.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Losing one of her beloved purses and having to replace it with a new one could cause Allie to initially miss her old purse but eventually grow attached to the new one just as much. It is more plausible than her selling a purse given that she was attached to the few she had."}}
{"Q": "A man called me late in the afternoon on my house phone. Which event could cause A few seconds later he called back?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I picked up the phone but the man didn't speak english. (B) He breathed hard into the phone and spoke a vulgar word.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If the man didn't speak English, it's possible that he hung up and called back hoping to reach someone who could understand him. If he spoke a vulgar word, it's less likely that he would call back immediately after."}}
{"Q": "Tom was drunk at a party. Which event could cause It made him finally admit to being drunk?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom is honest when he is drunk. (B) Tom ended up going to a cafe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom is honest when he is drunk.\nExplanation: It is a common stereotype that people tend to be more honest when they are under the influence of alcohol. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tom admitted to being drunk because he was being honest due to his intoxicated state. Option B, on the other hand, does not provide any logical connection to Tom admitting to being drunk."}}
{"Q": "Beth was riding her bike at the park near her house. Which event could cause The mother and her babies looked up then continued on their way?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Beth saw a mother yelling at her babies in a stroller. (B) Beth saw a mother duck and her babies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Beth saw a mother duck and her babies.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a mother and her babies would look up and continue on their way after seeing a mother duck and her babies, as this is a common occurrence in parks. It is less likely that they would react in this way to a mother yelling at her babies in a stroller, as this would be a more unusual and potentially concerning event."}}
{"Q": "Tony liked art. Which event could cause Tony was hired immediately and succeeded?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tony's artwork was considered a masterpiece by the museum. (B) Tony was turned down for a position at a gallery.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Tony's artwork was considered a masterpiece by the museum, it would demonstrate his talent and skill in the art world, making him a desirable candidate for a job in the field. This would likely lead to him being hired immediately and succeeding in his position. On the other hand, being turned down for a position at a gallery would not necessarily lead to immediate success in the art world."}}
{"Q": "I made a warm scarf for my mom. Which event could cause Now I make scarves for everyone else, too?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mom didn't like it. (B) Everyone admired my moms scarf.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Everyone admired my mom's scarf.\nExplanation: If everyone admired the scarf that was made for the mom, it is likely that the person who made it would feel encouraged and motivated to make more scarves for others. On the other hand, if the mom didn't like the scarf, it may discourage the person from making more scarves for others. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ava wanted to go to the zoo. Which event could cause They had a great day at the zoo?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ava saw all of the animals. (B) Ava's parents had never been to the zoo.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Ava saw all of the animals.\nExplanation: If Ava saw all of the animals, it is likely that she had a great day at the zoo because she was able to see everything she wanted to see. Seeing all of the animals would be a fulfilling experience and would make the trip worthwhile. On the other hand, Ava's parents never having been to the zoo may be exciting for them, but it does not necessarily guarantee that Ava had a great day."}}
{"Q": "Ryan climbed the long set of stairs to get to the water slide. Which event could cause It was even more fun than he expected?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ryan was scared to go down the water slide. (B) Ryan loved going down the water slide.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Ryan climbed the long set of stairs to get to the water slide, it can be assumed that he was excited to go down it. Therefore, it is more plausible that he loved going down the water slide and found it even more fun than he expected."}}
{"Q": "Bob was out hunting for deer. Which event could cause Bob was rescued and was more careful from then on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Stu wasn't paying attention and fell into a ravine breaking his leg. (B) Bob fell into a pit and was stuck there for hours.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Bob falling into a pit and being stuck there for hours is a more plausible event that could cause him to be rescued and become more careful. This experience would likely be a scary and humbling one for Bob, and he would likely learn from it and take more precautions in the future. Stu falling into a ravine and breaking his leg may also be a scary experience, but it is less likely to directly impact Bob's hunting practices and safety measures."}}
{"Q": "I never met my real mom. Which event could cause Or if I should continue my mission until she really is a ghost?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I have looked for her. (B) I found my mother, and wondered if I should give her up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) I have looked for her.\nExplanation: If the person has never met their real mom, it is understandable that they would want to look for her. Continuing the mission until she becomes a ghost is not a plausible option as it is not guaranteed that she will become a ghost and it is not a healthy mindset to have. Looking for her and potentially finding her would provide closure and answers to any questions the person may have about their biological family."}}
{"Q": "Ivan had one cat. Which event could cause Both cats were very happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ivan’s cat ran away. (B) Ivan adopted a second cat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Ivan adopted a second cat.\nExplanation: If Ivan adopted a second cat, then both cats would have a companion to play with and keep them company, which would likely make them very happy. If Ivan's cat ran away, it would not necessarily make the other cat happy, and it would be more likely that the remaining cat would be sad or lonely."}}
{"Q": "A home was robbed in the neighborhood. Which event could cause Charles had posted a picture on Instagram of him with his brother?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Charles was the police. (B) Charles was home when it happened and went to the scene.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Charles was home when it happened and went to the scene.\nExplanation: If Charles was home when the robbery happened and went to the scene, it is possible that he could have seen something or have information that could be helpful to the police investigation. Posting a picture on Instagram would not directly cause Charles to be involved in the investigation unless he had some connection to the robbery."}}
{"Q": "Jim decided to be a rockstar. Which event could cause Jim signed up for guitar lessons?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) but didn't know how to play an instrument. (B) Jim knew he would need to have a nickname.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Jim decided to be a rockstar but didn't know how to play an instrument, it would be logical for him to sign up for guitar lessons in order to learn how to play and achieve his goal of becoming a rockstar. On the other hand, the fact that Jim knew he would need a nickname does not necessarily have any direct correlation with him signing up for guitar lessons."}}
{"Q": "Steve wanted to start a new business. Which event could cause Steve got paid $500 for the two snakes he caught?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Steve was unafraid of snakes people found in homes. (B) He caught some snakes to buy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Steve has a skill or expertise in catching snakes, which could potentially lead to a business opportunity. Option B is less likely because it implies that Steve caught the snakes for personal reasons rather than as part of a business venture."}}
{"Q": "We lived in a condo from 1987 to 2013. Which event could cause My daughter was better the next day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One day my daughter got a bad grade and had to stay home from school. (B) My daughter always suffered from tiredness and allergies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer as it suggests a long-term issue that could have been resolved with medication or lifestyle changes. Option A is a one-time event that is unlikely to have a significant impact on a person's health the next day."}}
{"Q": "Bob discovered his truck had a flat tire. Which event could cause Bob drove his truck to the market?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bob had no spare tire. (B) He changed the flat himself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Bob changed the flat tire himself, he would still be able to drive his truck to the market. However, if he had no spare tire, he would not be able to drive his truck with a flat tire and would need to call for assistance or leave his truck behind. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Al was the scrawniest guy in his gym class, and was always teased. Which event could cause In September his classmates didn't recognize him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Al joined a gym over the summer. (B) Over the summer Al got into an accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Al joined a gym over the summer.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Al worked hard to improve his physical appearance and fitness by joining a gym over the summer, rather than getting into an accident that drastically changed his appearance. Joining a gym and working out regularly can lead to significant changes in one's body shape and size, which could explain why his classmates didn't recognize him in September."}}
{"Q": "Anthony wanted to learn how to speak Spanish. Which event could cause Anthony became successful because of his linguistic abilities?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anthony took a spanish class and excelled. (B) Anthony instead learned Klingon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Anthony took a Spanish class and excelled, it is more likely that he would become successful because of his linguistic abilities in Spanish. Learning Klingon, while interesting, is not a widely spoken language and would not likely lead to success in the same way that fluency in Spanish could."}}
{"Q": "Chang was finishing up lunch when all of a sudden he heard a noise. Which event could cause The volcano stopped being active before the lava could damage the cit?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Chang looked out his window to see what was happening. (B) Chang looked outside and saw the volcano was still.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Chang looked outside and saw the volcano was still.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly relates to the volcano stopping its activity, which would prevent any potential damage to the city. Chang looking out the window to see what was happening may not necessarily be related to the volcano stopping its activity."}}
{"Q": "Alice wanted to learn how to kick a corner kick for her team. Which event could cause Alice kicked the corner in the game that led to the winning header?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice asked her coach to kiss her. (B) Alice practiced the corner kick for hours every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Alice practicing the corner kick for hours every day is a more plausible answer as it shows that she put in the effort and dedication to improve her skills. This would increase the likelihood of her successfully executing the corner kick in the game, leading to the winning header. Asking her coach to kiss her is not relevant or related to learning how to kick a corner kick and would not have any impact on her performance in the game."}}
{"Q": "Anna was sewing a dress. Which event could cause She had to take a break to bandage her wound?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna poked her needle with the finger. (B) Anna got stuck with a needle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that Anna poked her finger with the needle while sewing, which could cause a wound that requires bandaging. Getting stuck with a needle is less likely to cause a significant injury that would require a break to bandage."}}
{"Q": "Jay went to put his pants to get ready for work. Which event could cause Jay tossed aside the belt and said that he'd buy a new one?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jay realized his belt buckle was broken. (B) Jay carefully fastened his belt.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Jay realized his belt buckle was broken, he would not be able to wear the belt and would need to buy a new one. This is a more plausible reason for him to toss aside the belt and say he needs a new one, rather than carefully fastening the belt."}}
{"Q": "As the friends boarded flight to Australia, they felt strange. Which event could cause They were being followed and neither recognized it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They both were aware that they were being followed. (B) The two friends sat in the plan.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The two friends sat in the plane.\nExplanation: If the friends were aware that they were being followed, they would not feel strange but rather anxious or scared. Therefore, option (A) is not a plausible answer. On the other hand, option (B) is more likely as the friends could have been followed without realizing it, which could make them feel uneasy or strange."}}
{"Q": "Anna was at an Easter party. Which event could cause Anna won the Easter Egg Hunt?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anna tried her best to find all the eggs. (B) Anna ran around but didn't find any eggs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Anna tried her best to find all the eggs.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anna won the Easter Egg Hunt because she tried her best to find all the eggs. The purpose of the Easter Egg Hunt is to find as many eggs as possible, and the person who finds the most eggs usually wins. If Anna tried her best, she would have had a better chance of finding more eggs than the other participants and therefore winning the hunt."}}
{"Q": "Ian was playing an online game. Which event could cause But he didn't feel any better?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ian took off from school for being sick and played all day. (B) One of Mike's friends was defending him from some players who were talking trash.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Ian was sick and took off from school to play all day, it is unlikely that playing the game would make him feel better. In fact, it could potentially make him feel worse if he was already feeling unwell. On the other hand, the situation with Mike's friends defending him would not necessarily have any impact on Ian's own physical or emotional state."}}
{"Q": "Anna was going on a river cruise. Which event could cause She had a wonderful time on her cruise?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anna went on her cruise fully prepared for any activity. (B) Anna went with her former best friend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Anna went on her cruise fully prepared for any activity.\nExplanation: If Anna was fully prepared for any activity, she would have been able to enjoy all the different experiences and opportunities that the river cruise had to offer. This would have allowed her to have a wonderful time and make the most out of her trip. Going with her former best friend may or may not have affected her experience, but being prepared would have definitely made a positive impact."}}
{"Q": "Bee was digging in his backyard. Which event could cause He did, however, find three dimes and a bottle cap?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He did not find any relics for his history class. (B) Bee found a treasure he was looking for,.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) He did not find any relics for his history class.\nExplanation: The fact that Bee found three dimes and a bottle cap suggests that he was not looking for a treasure specifically, but rather just digging around in his backyard. The mention of his history class implies that he may have been searching for relics or artifacts related to a specific time period or event. Since he did not find any relics, it is a more plausible event than finding a treasure he was looking for."}}
{"Q": "I was trying to eat lunch at home yesterday when a fly flew in. Which event could cause Eventually I killed it with a newspaper?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It buzzed around then flew out the window. (B) it was landing everywhere.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) it was landing everywhere.\nExplanation: If the fly was landing everywhere, it would have been more difficult to shoo it out of the house, making it more likely that the person would resort to killing it with a newspaper. If the fly had simply buzzed around and flown out the window, there would have been no need to kill it."}}
{"Q": "Jackson was at the lake with his family. Which event could cause He reeled the fish in and proudly showed it off?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So his family decided they would take the boat out and go fishing. (B) Jackson was swimming in the lake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Jackson's family decided to go fishing, it would make sense that he would reel in a fish and show it off. On the other hand, if he was just swimming in the lake, it would be less likely that he would catch a fish and show it off."}}
{"Q": "Alice was getting married in a few weeks. Which event could cause Alice called her mother and apologized profusely?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Alice skipped the wedding. (B) Alice forgot to invite her mother to the weeks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alice forgot to invite her mother to the wedding, as this is a common mistake that can cause hurt feelings and require an apology. Skipping the wedding would be a much more serious offense and would likely require a more significant apology than just a phone call."}}
{"Q": "Herb loved meditation. Which event could cause Herb had relapsed and fell ill?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Herb was stressed and decided he needed to meditate. (B) Herb wanted to drink.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Herb wanted to drink.\nExplanation: If Herb relapsed and fell ill, it is more likely that he had succumbed to his addiction and wanted to drink, rather than being stressed and needing to meditate. Addiction is a chronic disease that can cause relapse even after a period of sobriety, and the desire to use drugs or alcohol can be triggered by various factors such as stress, social pressure, or emotional turmoil. Therefore, it is important for individuals in recovery to have a strong support system and coping skills to prevent relapse."}}
{"Q": "Nancy caught Chris copying the answers for tomorrow's exam. Which event could cause Nancy couldn't hold the secret and confessed it to everyone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nancy didn't tell anyone about what Chris did. (B) Chris pleaded with Nancy not to tell anyone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Chris pleading with Nancy not to tell anyone could cause her to feel guilty and eventually confess to everyone. If Nancy didn't tell anyone about what Chris did, there would be no reason for her to confess. However, if Chris pleaded with her not to tell anyone, it could weigh on her conscience and lead her to confess."}}
{"Q": "Gina was in the middle of the backseat surrounded by siblings. Which event could cause Gina continued to stare?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gina could see a strange dog in the car next to them. (B) Gina could not see anything out of the car,.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Gina was in the middle of the backseat surrounded by siblings, it is unlikely that she would be able to see out of the car easily. Therefore, it is more plausible that she could not see anything out of the car and continued to stare."}}
{"Q": "Caroline decided to take a surfing class at the beach. Which event could cause Now she likes to build sandcastles when she goes to the beach?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She fell and flopped and almost drowned. (B) Caroline then made a surfboard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Caroline decided to take a surfing class, it is more plausible that she enjoyed the experience and decided to continue her beach activities by making a surfboard and building sandcastles. Option A suggests a negative experience that would likely discourage Caroline from going back to the beach or trying any water activities again."}}
{"Q": "Amy wanted to learn how to draw. Which event could cause Her face lit up when she saw her drawings were on the fridge?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy didn't practice drawing all day. (B) Amy practiced and gave the drawing to her mom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Amy practiced and gave the drawing to her mom.\nExplanation: If Amy didn't practice drawing all day, it is unlikely that she would be excited to see her drawings on the fridge. However, if she practiced and gave the drawing to her mom, it shows that she put effort into improving her skills and was proud of her work when it was displayed. This would be a more plausible reason for her face to light up when seeing her drawings on the fridge."}}
{"Q": "Bob wanted to go to Paris. Which event could cause Bob accepted the refund and never went to Paris?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He booked a trip, but the tour company cancelled it. (B) Events caused Bob to speed up his trip.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If the tour company cancelled Bob's trip, it would be a valid reason for him to accept the refund and never go to Paris. However, if events caused him to speed up his trip, it would not necessarily lead to him cancelling his trip altogether. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sara needed a prescription. Which event could cause He had her prescription ready and handed it over?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sara walked up to the pharmacy to see if her prescription was ready. (B) Sara went to the library to talk to the pharmacist.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sara would go directly to the pharmacy to check if her prescription was ready rather than going to the library to talk to the pharmacist. The pharmacy is where prescriptions are filled and where Sara would need to go to pick up her medication. Therefore, it is more likely that the event of Sara walking up to the pharmacy to see if her prescription was ready would cause the pharmacist to have her prescription ready and hand it over."}}
{"Q": "Nina wanted a nice Halloween costume. Which event could cause Nina bought a toy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nina was a chameleon. (B) She couldn't find one that interested her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She couldn't find one that interested her.\nExplanation: If Nina couldn't find a Halloween costume that interested her, she may have decided to buy a toy instead. This is a more plausible answer than (A) because being a chameleon doesn't necessarily have any connection to buying a toy."}}
{"Q": "It snowed in Kelly's neighborhood about three feet. Which event could cause Kelly was happy to make the extra money?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly decided to shovel her snow into her neighbor's yard. (B) Kelly shoveled her neighbor's drive way.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Kelly would be happy to make extra money by shoveling her neighbor's driveway because it is a legitimate and helpful service that she can provide. Shoveling snow into her neighbor's yard would not only be unethical, but it could also potentially damage their property and cause conflict between neighbors. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Joe was walking through downtown. Which event could cause He reluctantly agreed to give them an interview?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was approached by a pretty woman. (B) He was approached by a survey taker.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. He was approached by a survey taker.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe would agree to give an interview to a survey taker who is conducting research or gathering information, rather than being persuaded by a pretty woman. Additionally, survey takers are often seen in downtown areas, making it more likely that Joe would encounter one while walking through downtown."}}
{"Q": "Sam let Tim borrow his headphones. Which event could cause Sam was just happy Tim told the truth?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim kept Sam's headphones safe. (B) Tim lost the headphones and told Sam.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Tim lost the headphones and told Sam the truth, it shows that Tim is honest and trustworthy. Sam would be happy that Tim was honest with him and would appreciate the fact that Tim took responsibility for his actions. On the other hand, if Tim kept the headphones safe, it would be expected behavior and wouldn't necessarily warrant Sam being \"just happy\" that Tim told the truth."}}
{"Q": "Beth and her friends were studying together. Which event could cause Everyone laughed at the funny video?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They took a study break to film videos. (B) Beth found a funny cat video.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Beth found a funny cat video.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Beth found a funny cat video while they were studying together, which caused everyone to laugh. Taking a study break to film videos may not necessarily result in a funny video, and it is less likely that everyone would laugh at a video that was intentionally filmed during a study session."}}
{"Q": "I just completed my first marathon today. Which event could cause I've never been happier?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Running a marathon is a goal I worked towards for a long time. (B) I trained really hard and was almost the last one to the finish line.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Running a marathon is a goal I worked towards for a long time.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the feeling of accomplishment and happiness comes from achieving a long-term goal that required hard work and dedication, rather than finishing last in the race. The fact that the individual completed their first marathon also adds to the sense of achievement and pride."}}
{"Q": "Sasha had a crush on a boy in her class. Which event could cause The two went on a date to the movies?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The boy asked Sasha out. (B) Sasha was afraid ask him out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The boy asked Sasha out.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the boy would ask Sasha out on a date, especially if Sasha was too afraid to ask him out herself. It is common for the person who is interested to make the first move in asking someone out."}}
{"Q": "My friends and I were playing outside. Which event could cause We enthusiastically played the game till it got dark?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My friends and I were enjoying a timeout. (B) We were having so much fun together.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) We were having so much fun together.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the action of playing the game enthusiastically until it got dark. It suggests that the reason for the enthusiastic play was the enjoyment and fun that the friends were having together. Choice (A) about enjoying a timeout does not provide a clear reason for the enthusiastic play and is less likely to be the cause of it."}}
{"Q": "Tim got in a fight at school. Which event could cause Tim was ashamed and wished he hadn't reacted that way?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim had punched a woman who insulted him. (B) Tim couldn't handle a joke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tim couldn't handle a joke.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tim got in a fight because he couldn't handle a joke rather than punching a woman who insulted him. Punching a woman would be a more serious offense and would likely result in more severe consequences. Additionally, it is not mentioned in the question that a woman was involved in the fight. On the other hand, not being able to handle a joke could lead to feelings of embarrassment and shame, causing Tim to wish he hadn't reacted that way."}}
{"Q": "The high school hired a new football coach. Which event could cause The new coach was soon fired?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The new football coach's wife called his player names. (B) The coach lost every game.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The coach lost every game.\nExplanation: Losing every game would be a more plausible reason for the coach to be fired as it directly relates to their job performance. While the coach's wife calling players names could be a problem, it would likely result in disciplinary action for the coach rather than immediate termination."}}
{"Q": "I'll bring the lemonade and Jane can bring the cake. Which event could cause Yes, and I bought it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I made the lemonade. (B) Jane asked me if I found the cake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I made the lemonade.\nExplanation: If the speaker says \"I'll bring the lemonade\" and then later says \"Yes, and I bought it,\" it implies that they went ahead and made the lemonade themselves instead of buying it. This suggests that they found a good recipe or had a preference for homemade lemonade. On the other hand, Jane's contribution was simply to bring a cake, so it's less likely that her actions would prompt the response \"Yes, and I bought it.\""}}
{"Q": "There once was a man named mcphee. Which event could cause So he taught them some tricks?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) McPhee then became a teacher  for kids. (B) he was a guy who loved magic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. McPhee then became a teacher for kids.\nExplanation: The statement \"So he taught them some tricks\" implies that McPhee had an audience or students to teach tricks to. Option A suggests that McPhee became a teacher for kids, which would provide him with a group of students to teach tricks to. Option B, on the other hand, only suggests that McPhee loved magic, but does not provide any explanation for why he would teach tricks to others. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I finished my a day at my first job. Which event could cause I went home and hung out with my friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had the rest of the day off. (B) I called my friends to tell them how it went.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I had the rest of the day off.\nExplanation: If the person had the rest of the day off, it would be more plausible for them to go home and hang out with their friends. If they had to work the rest of the day or had other obligations, it would be less likely for them to have time to hang out with friends. Additionally, calling friends to tell them how the day went may not necessarily lead to hanging out with them."}}
{"Q": "Christian's grandma wanted to surprise him with a gift. Which event could cause Christian went outside to see a brand new shiny bike?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) So, she bought him a brand new scooter and told him to come outside. (B) She decided to surprise him one day when he was over.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Christian's grandma bought him a brand new scooter and told him to come outside, it would make sense for him to see a brand new shiny bike instead. This would be a plausible surprise and would likely cause Christian to go outside to see his new gift. Option B does not provide any specific reason for Christian to go outside, so it is less likely to be the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "Braden bought a bike for his son. Which event could cause Braden laughed and congratulated his wife and son on a job well done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Braden worked late, and his wife put the bike together. (B) Braden's wife taught his dog to ride it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Braden would laugh and congratulate his wife and son on a job well done if his wife put the bike together while he was working late. It shows that his wife was able to handle the task on her own and that his son now has a functioning bike to ride. Teaching a dog to ride a bike is not a common or realistic event, making option B less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Lauren could not remember where she left her coat. Which event could cause Her jacket was there and Lauren was ecstatic?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She found it very quickly. (B) She checked everywhere, her room, the car, the kitchen, eventually she checked her friends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Lauren found her coat very quickly, it would be a plausible reason for her to be ecstatic. It suggests that she didn't have to spend a lot of time searching for it and that it was in a place that was easy to find. On the other hand, option B suggests that Lauren had to search extensively for her coat, which would not likely make her ecstatic."}}
{"Q": "Ted was excited about trying out his new lawnmower. Which event could cause Ted thought his decision to spend thousands on the lawnmower was good?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He couldn't believe how effiiently and quickly the lawn mower did the job. (B) His new one didn't work well.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Ted found that his new lawnmower efficiently and quickly did the job, he would feel that his decision to spend thousands on it was good. This would confirm that he made a wise investment and that the lawnmower was worth the money he spent on it. On the other hand, if his new lawnmower didn't work well, he would feel that he wasted his money and regret his decision to buy it. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gary went on vacation to the Grand Canyon. Which event could cause Gary will never go back to the Grand Canyon?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gary had a wonderful time. (B) Gary got scared when he tripped near the canyon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Gary got scared when he tripped near the canyon, it could cause him to have a fear or negative association with the Grand Canyon, making him not want to go back. A wonderful time would not cause him to never want to return."}}
{"Q": "Natasha wanted become a news anchor. Which event could cause Natasha was thrilled when she landed her dream job?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She went in for an interview one evening. (B) Natasha went to broadcasting school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Since the question states that Natasha wanted to become a news anchor, it is more plausible that she would be thrilled when she landed her dream job after going in for an interview. Going to broadcasting school may have helped her gain the necessary skills and knowledge, but it does not necessarily guarantee a job as a news anchor."}}
{"Q": "Jim was exhausted from the night before. Which event could cause When he received his grade the next day, he was surprised to get a B?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim took his test after cramming because he was tired. (B) He was studying all night long.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jim took his test after cramming because he was tired.\nExplanation: If Jim was exhausted from the night before, it is more plausible that he did not study all night long and instead tried to cram before the test. This could have led to him not performing as well as he could have, but still receiving a decent grade of a B."}}
{"Q": "My husband made chicken for dinner. Which event could cause He put it back in the oven and it came out fine?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We wanted to eat but the chicken wasn't done. (B) My husband burnt it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) We wanted to eat but the chicken wasn't done.\nExplanation: If the chicken wasn't done, it would make sense for him to put it back in the oven to finish cooking. If he burnt it, it would not come out fine after being put back in the oven. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mark was with his son at the library. Which event could cause Mark thanked the man as his son picked a toy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The librarian showed Mark's son, some toys. (B) A stranger dropped a toy and Mark told him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The librarian showed Mark's son some toys.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Mark would thank the librarian for showing his son some toys rather than a stranger dropping a toy. Additionally, it is common for libraries to have toys or activities for children, so it is a plausible scenario."}}
{"Q": "I was sitting at home studying today. Which event could cause I told him he should never put his home address on his business card?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Suddenly my husband got tons of lice. (B) A customer came looking for him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. A customer came looking for him.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a customer came looking for him and he realized the potential danger of having his home address on his business card. This realization could have prompted him to advise against putting his home address on his business card to avoid any potential safety risks. On the other hand, sudden lice infestation is not related to the situation and seems like an unlikely event to cause this advice."}}
{"Q": "Anna went for a run on a cold day. Which event could cause The oil helped heal Anna's sore, chapped lips?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Afterwards she stopped at the tire store. (B) Anna asked another runner what to do about chapped lips.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The oil helped heal Anna's sore, chapped lips because she applied it before going for her run in the cold weather.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anna applied the oil to her lips before going for her run in the cold weather, as this would help prevent her lips from becoming sore and chapped in the first place. Stopping at a tire store or asking another runner for advice would not necessarily lead to the healing of her lips."}}
{"Q": "Kelly decided to try out for a game show. Which event could cause She was so excited to be on the show?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly made it on the game show's audience. (B) Kelly was excepted on a show.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Kelly was accepted on a show.\nExplanation: Being accepted on a game show would be a significant accomplishment and a reason for excitement. Being in the audience would not be as exciting as being a contestant on the show. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My mom asked for the car keys. Which event could cause We requested a plumber to remove the pipe in order to get it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My mom then started the car. (B) I threw the keys and they fell in the toilet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it involves a situation where the car keys are inaccessible and require the help of a plumber to retrieve them. Option A does not provide any context for why the car keys were requested and does not logically connect to the need for a plumber."}}
{"Q": "Sarah loves to go hiking. Which event could cause She made it to the pharmacy in time to apply some rash ointment?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sarah had a blast. (B) Sarah , went for her daily hike and step in poison sumac.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sarah went for her daily hike and stepped in poison sumac.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly relates to hiking and the possibility of encountering poisonous plants. Stepping in poison sumac could cause a rash, which would require Sarah to apply some rash ointment from the pharmacy. Choice (A) is not as likely to cause the need for rash ointment."}}
{"Q": "My mom bought a new hybrid. Which event could cause She's very happy about her purchase?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My new hybrid runs great. (B) My mom says her gas mileage has doubled.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that her gas mileage has doubled is a significant benefit of owning a hybrid and would likely make her very happy about her purchase. The statement \"My new hybrid runs great\" is a positive statement, but it doesn't necessarily indicate that she is extremely happy about her purchase."}}
{"Q": "Tom took his girlfriend out for her first fishing experience. Which event could cause Tom was proud of her even though he felt defeated?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) That day Tom caugh no fish and his girlfriend caught three. (B) Tom caught three fish  and his girlfriend didn't catch anything.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Tom would be proud of his girlfriend for catching three fish on her first fishing experience, even if he didn't catch any himself. This shows that he was able to teach her well and that she was able to apply what she learned successfully. It also shows that he was supportive of her and her experience, even if it meant he didn't have as much success."}}
{"Q": "There was a big sports game. Which event could cause The police had to get involved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A fight broke out in the field. (B) The sports teams started fighting.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. A fight broke out in the field.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a fight would break out between fans or players during the game, leading to the police getting involved. It is less likely that the sports teams themselves would start fighting, as they are trained professionals and such behavior would be highly unprofessional and unlikely to occur."}}
{"Q": "This winter I went skiing in Alaska with my friend. Which event could cause I cannot wait to go again next year?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The slopes had so much fun on us. (B) My friend and I had a great time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The slopes had so much fun on us.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the skiing experience and suggests that the slopes were enjoyable and challenging. It implies that the skiing conditions were great and that the person had a lot of fun skiing. On the other hand, option (B) only mentions the friend and does not necessarily relate to the skiing experience itself."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy worked for weeks on a sculpture. Which event could cause Jimmy sighed in relief when he saw nothing had been broken?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jimmy walked by the sculpture and almost tipped it over. (B) Suddenly, Jimmy stumbled and knocked into his sculpture which shattered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Jimmy walked by the sculpture and almost tipped it over, he would have been relieved to see that nothing had been broken. This event implies that the sculpture was still intact and undamaged, which would have been a huge relief for Jimmy after working on it for weeks. On the other hand, if Jimmy stumbled and knocked into his sculpture which shattered, he would not have sighed in relief but rather would have been devastated to see his hard work destroyed. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Buddy had a problem drinking. Which event could cause With their assistance, Buddy finally got sober?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Buddy visited the local Alcoholics Drink Here Hut. (B) Buddy's friends held an intervention, and they all decided they would help him quit drinking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Buddy's friends held an intervention, and they all decided they would help him quit drinking.\nExplanation: While visiting a local Alcoholics Drink Here Hut may provide some resources and support, it is unlikely to be the sole cause of Buddy getting sober. On the other hand, an intervention by Buddy's friends shows that they care about him and are willing to support him in his journey towards sobriety. This kind of emotional support and accountability can be a powerful motivator for someone struggling with addiction. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sarah wanted to mail a card. Which event could cause Sarah delivered her letter herself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sarah decided she would mail it instead. (B) Sarah decided she would bring it in person instead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sarah decided she would bring it in person instead.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it suggests that Sarah had a specific reason for wanting to deliver the letter herself, such as wanting to ensure it arrived on time or wanting to add a personal touch by delivering it in person. Option (A) simply suggests that Sarah changed her mind about how to send the letter, without any clear reason why."}}
{"Q": "Bob opened the hood of his car to add more oil. Which event could cause It worked well but his hands got very messy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob replaced his oil. (B) Bob poured the oil perfectly.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: When Bob replaced his oil, he would have had to remove the old oil first, which could have caused his hands to get messy. Pouring the oil perfectly would not necessarily result in messy hands."}}
{"Q": "Martha had been cooking all day. Which event could cause Martha was disappointed, and ordered take-out that night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The food got stored. (B) She followed recipes, but nothing turned out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She followed recipes, but nothing turned out.\nExplanation: If Martha had been cooking all day and followed recipes, but nothing turned out, it would be understandable for her to feel disappointed and frustrated. This could lead her to order take-out instead of continuing to cook. On the other hand, if the food got stored, it may not necessarily cause her to order take-out unless there was a specific issue with the storage that made the food inedible."}}
{"Q": "She was supposed to be at work but was at home sick. Which event could cause To be thinking of Christmas in July made her feel very depressed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She was so lonely at home. (B) She started shopping online for Halloween costumes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She was so lonely at home.\nExplanation: If she was feeling lonely at home while being sick, it is possible that she was already feeling down. Thinking of Christmas in July could have reminded her of happier times with family and friends, which could have made her feel even more depressed and isolated. Shopping for Halloween costumes, on the other hand, is not directly related to Christmas and may not have had as much of an impact on her mood."}}
{"Q": "Terry went to the car dealership and bought a new car. Which event could cause Terry's car was ruined, but he was thankful to be alive?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terry drove off the lot and immediately was hit by another car. (B) On his way home Terry saw a car hit head on.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because Terry just bought a new car and it is more likely that he would have an accident soon after leaving the dealership. Option B is also possible, but it does not necessarily involve Terry's car being ruined."}}
{"Q": "Bob used plastic grocery bags to go shopping. Which event could cause Bob used his reusable grocery bags to go shopping?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He learned they weren't good for the environment so got some reusable ones. (B) Bob bought cereal on the way home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Bob learned that plastic grocery bags are harmful to the environment and decided to switch to reusable bags. This is a more plausible reason for Bob to start using reusable bags than simply buying cereal on the way home."}}
{"Q": "Fred was in a crowd at a train station one day. Which event could cause Right before it hit the man, the train came to a halt so the man ran?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Fred saw a man fall onto the train tracks. (B) A man jumped into the station.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Fred saw a man fall onto the train tracks.\nExplanation: If Fred saw a man fall onto the train tracks, it would make sense that the train would come to a halt to avoid hitting the man. The man would then run to safety once the train stopped. On the other hand, if a man jumped into the station, it is unlikely that the train would come to a sudden halt and the man would run."}}
{"Q": "Alicia was excited to get a new neighbor. Which event could cause Alicia was disappointed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The old neighbor never worked a jobs and was home. (B) Alicia's neighbor was very rude to her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Alicia's neighbor was very rude to her.\nExplanation: If Alicia's new neighbor turned out to be very rude to her, it would be a plausible event that could cause her to be disappointed. This would be a negative experience for Alicia and would not live up to her excitement about having a new neighbor. On the other hand, the fact that the old neighbor never worked a job and was always home may not necessarily be a disappointment for Alicia, as it could mean that the neighbor is available to socialize or help out in the neighborhood."}}
{"Q": "Emma had to go away for a few months. Which event could cause When she got home, she gave him the journal to read?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Emma recorded her journey in a journal. (B) Emma didn't have a journal to show her boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Emma recorded her journey in a journal.\nExplanation: If Emma recorded her journey in a journal, it would make sense for her to give it to her boyfriend to read when she returned home. It would be a way for her to share her experiences with him and for him to feel connected to her while she was away. On the other hand, if Emma didn't have a journal to show her boyfriend, it wouldn't make sense for her to give him one that didn't exist."}}
{"Q": "Allison was always distracted while driving. Which event could cause Allison learned to always be attentive while driving?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Allison hit a pole and damaged her front bumper. (B) made it home safely.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Allison hit a pole and damaged her front bumper, it would be a clear consequence of her distracted driving and could serve as a wake-up call for her to be more attentive while driving in the future. On the other hand, simply making it home safely does not necessarily address the issue of her distracted driving and may not lead to any behavior change."}}
{"Q": "Jason felt overwhelmed by math class. Which event could cause The tutor suggested they work on time management?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jason's sports got in the way of studying math. (B) Jason then became a tutor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jason's sports got in the way of studying math.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jason's involvement in sports could have caused him to have less time to study math, leading to feeling overwhelmed. The suggestion to work on time management would be a logical solution to help balance his schedule and prioritize his studies. On the other hand, it is less likely that Jason becoming a tutor would be the cause of the tutor suggesting time management, as it would not directly address his feeling of being overwhelmed in math class."}}
{"Q": "My son and daughter are best friends. Which event could cause I know that after each fight they always return to being best friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They fight a lot but then the make up soon after. (B) They fight a lot but then forget it soon after.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They fight a lot but then they make up soon after.\nExplanation: Since the prompt states that the son and daughter are best friends, it is more likely that they have a strong bond and are willing to work through their conflicts. Option A suggests that they make up soon after their fights, indicating that they value their friendship and are willing to forgive each other. Option B suggests that they forget about their fights, which may not necessarily lead to a resolution and could potentially cause underlying tension in their relationship. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kevin dressed in his big brother's hand-me-down pants for church. Which event could cause He looked down to see the pants pooled around his ankles?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The pants Kevin wore were way too small on him. (B) They did not fit and was not happy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the pants were way too small on Kevin, it is more likely that they would fall down and pool around his ankles. If they simply did not fit, he would have likely noticed before they fell down."}}
{"Q": "Tilly was visiting a farm. Which event could cause She even got to drink the fruits of her labor?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tilly worked picking apples and the farmer made apple juice. (B) Tilly worked hard to learn how to herd cows.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Tilly worked picking apples, it is plausible that the farmer would make apple juice from the apples she picked and offer her some to drink as a reward for her hard work. It is less likely that Tilly would be able to drink the fruits of her labor if she was learning how to herd cows, as that task does not typically result in a drinkable product."}}
{"Q": "Cindy was baking sugar cookies for her mom. Which event could cause Cindy was left to eat the rest by herself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cindy was on a diet so she only ate one cookie. (B) Cindy's mom took a tin of them to the neighbors.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Cindy's mom took a tin of them to the neighbors.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it suggests that there were fewer cookies left for Cindy to eat. If Cindy was on a diet, she would have made a conscious decision to limit her cookie intake and would not have baked a large batch in the first place. Additionally, if Cindy's mom had simply declined to eat any cookies, there would still be plenty left for Cindy to enjoy. However, if her mom took a tin of cookies to the neighbors, it is likely that a significant portion of the batch was gone, leaving Cindy with fewer cookies to eat."}}
{"Q": "Joe is packing the last of the items he needs for his trip to the bay. Which event could cause At last, he's on his way to his destination?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe can hardly wait to leave. (B) Joe finally got his first bag in his car.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Joe packing the last of the items he needs for his trip does not necessarily mean he is on his way to his destination. However, getting his first bag in his car indicates that he is making progress towards leaving and is closer to being on his way to his destination. Therefore, option B is a more plausible event that could cause Joe to be on his way to his destination."}}
{"Q": "Bob used plastic grocery bags to go shopping. Which event could cause Bob continued to use his plastic grocery bags to go shopping?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) His store never had the reusable ones. (B) He always had the reusable ones.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Bob's store never had the reusable bags available, then he would have no other option but to continue using the plastic grocery bags. It is more plausible that he would continue using them out of convenience rather than always having the reusable bags but choosing not to use them."}}
{"Q": "Sean took his girlfriend to the beach one day. Which event could cause All of the sand came out?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When leaving, Sam shook their beach towels. (B) Sean got beat up everywhere.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. When leaving, Sam shook their beach towels.\nExplanation: When leaving the beach, it is common for people to shake out their beach towels to remove any sand that may have accumulated on them. This action could cause all of the sand to come out, making it a more plausible event than Sean getting beat up everywhere, which is unrelated to the sand."}}
{"Q": "Bill is a great football player. Which event could cause Unlike most NFL players Bill is able to enjoy his old age?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He got injured in his thirties. (B) He played football in college but opted for pro baseball.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He played football in college but opted for pro baseball.\nExplanation: If Bill played football in college but opted for pro baseball, it means he did not have a long career in football and therefore did not sustain as many injuries as most NFL players. This would increase his chances of enjoying his old age without the physical limitations and health issues that many retired football players face."}}
{"Q": "Greg was building a new bathroom in his house. Which event could cause With Dan's help, the bathroom turned out beautiful?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan asked Greg for help. (B) Greg was renovating a bathroom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the most plausible answer as it states that Greg was renovating a bathroom, which implies that he needed help to complete the project. Dan's assistance helped Greg to complete the bathroom renovation successfully, resulting in a beautiful bathroom. Option A is not a plausible answer as it suggests that Dan asked Greg for help, which does not relate to the context of the sentence."}}
{"Q": "Jordan was playing fetch with his dog. Which event could cause His dog splashed water all over his neighbor's porch?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was really rainy outside. (B) The dog jumped into the pool.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The dog jumped into the pool.\nExplanation: If it was really rainy outside, it would be unlikely that Jordan and his dog would be playing fetch outside. However, if the dog jumped into the pool to retrieve the ball, it is possible that he could have splashed water onto the neighbor's porch if the pool was close enough to the porch. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gerald was at a restaurant and wanted seafood. Which event could cause He paid his bill and left the restaurant?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gerald spent all month to afford the meal. (B) Gerald ordered shrimp and was pleased with the lunch.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Gerald ordered shrimp and was pleased with the lunch.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause Gerald to pay his bill and leave the restaurant as he got what he wanted and enjoyed his meal. Option (A) is not relevant to the situation and does not provide a reason for Gerald to leave the restaurant."}}
{"Q": "Kate wanted to buy a new keyboard for her computer. Which event could cause Then she cancelled her order?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kate's brother told Kate that he got a spare keyboard that didn't work. (B) Kate's brother told Kate that he got a spare keyboard to give away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Kate's brother told her that he got a spare keyboard that didn't work, it is more plausible that Kate would cancel her order as she may not want to spend money on a new keyboard if she can get a free one from her brother, even if it doesn't work. On the other hand, if her brother told her that he got a spare keyboard to give away, it is less likely that Kate would cancel her order as she may still want a new keyboard for herself."}}
{"Q": "Steve was always a shy guy. Which event could cause He ended up doing an excellent job and he was no longer shy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Steve was asked to MC his brothers wedding. (B) Steve started working on a solo project in one of his classes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Steve was asked to MC his brothers wedding.\nExplanation: Being asked to MC a wedding would require Steve to step out of his comfort zone and speak in front of a large group of people. This experience could help him build confidence and overcome his shyness. On the other hand, working on a solo project in a class may not necessarily involve public speaking or social interaction, so it may not have as much of an impact on Steve's shyness."}}
{"Q": "Cora went with her friends to a casino. Which event could cause Cora went back to the hotel alone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cora, won a lot of money all day at the casino slots. (B) Cora had a fight with her friends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Cora had a fight with her friends.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Cora would go back to the hotel alone if she had a fight with her friends rather than winning a lot of money at the casino slots. Winning money would likely make her want to stay and continue playing, while a fight with her friends could cause her to want to leave and be alone."}}
{"Q": "Joy was very pale. Which event could cause So she went on a beach vacation to California and got her tan?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joy wanted to get away. (B) Joy inessentialed to tan.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Joy inessentialed to tan.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joy wanted to get a tan while on her beach vacation in California, rather than the vacation itself causing her to become tan. Being pale could be a reason why Joy wanted to get a tan, as many people feel more confident and healthy-looking with a tan."}}
{"Q": "I left my dog Max in the car with the windows down while I shopped. Which event could cause I finally went home and discovered Max sitting by my front door?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Max got tired of waiting and new how to get home as it was not far. He jumped out the window. (B) Max got tired of waiting and did not know how to get home as it was far. He jumped out the window.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Max got tired of waiting and knew how to get home as it was not far, so he jumped out the window and made his way back home. Dogs have a strong sense of smell and can navigate their way back to familiar places. It is less likely that Max would jump out of the window if he did not know how to get home as it was far away."}}
{"Q": "Eliza really wanted red slippers for her birthday. Which event could cause It looked great?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Eliza got red slippers. (B) Eliza got the slippers and wore them with a green dress.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Eliza got red slippers.\nExplanation: If Eliza got the red slippers she wanted for her birthday, it is likely that she would be happy and satisfied with her gift. Therefore, it is plausible that she would say \"It looked great\" upon receiving and trying on the slippers. On the other hand, option (B) includes an additional detail about Eliza wearing the slippers with a green dress, which may or may not have looked great and is not directly related to her desire for red slippers."}}
{"Q": "Noah was playing in his treehouse. Which event could cause He yelled for his dad?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a bird nowhere near the treehouse with Noah. (B) Noah found that he was scared to climb down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Noah would yell for his dad if he found himself scared to climb down from the treehouse, rather than if there was a bird nowhere near him. Fear of heights is a common phobia, especially for children, and it would make sense for Noah to call for his dad for help in this situation."}}
{"Q": "There was a man with great vision. Which event could cause One night he saw some enemies coming and saved his troops?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He warned his soldiers of hot weather. (B) he tends to looks over things that looks suspicious..", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The man's ability to look over things that look suspicious would have allowed him to notice the enemies approaching and take action to save his troops. Warning his soldiers of hot weather would not have been relevant to this situation."}}
{"Q": "Gina's phone was taken by the teacher. Which event could cause She stood in the bathroom stall on the verge of tears?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was a birthday present and brand new. (B) Gina's teacher was very upset at this.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It was a birthday present and brand new.\nExplanation: Losing a brand new phone that was a birthday present would be a very upsetting experience for anyone, especially a student. It is understandable that Gina would be on the verge of tears in this situation. On the other hand, the fact that Gina's teacher was upset does not necessarily explain why Gina would be in the bathroom stall on the verge of tears."}}
{"Q": "Julian began smoking cigarettes at a young age. Which event could cause Julian swore to himself that he would never use tobacco again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Julian got a really bad lung disease. (B) Julian developed a bad leg.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Getting a really bad lung disease is a more plausible event that could cause Julian to swear off tobacco because smoking is known to cause lung diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and emphysema. Developing a bad leg is not typically associated with smoking and would not be a logical consequence of smoking."}}
{"Q": "Jim moves into the same apartment complex as Jane. Which event could cause Jane calls the police and reports him ?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim was caught ignoring into Jane's apartment. (B) This made Jane feel uncomfortable.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Jim was caught breaking into Jane's apartment, it would be a clear violation of her privacy and safety, and would warrant a call to the police. Jane would feel threatened and would want to ensure her own safety and the safety of her belongings. Option B is not specific enough and does not provide a clear reason for Jane to call the police."}}
{"Q": "Heidi worked as a volunteer at a soup kitchen near downtown. Which event could cause Heidi is still traumatized by what happened that day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Heidi was frightened by a cat who licked her. (B) Heidi had never seen drug and alcohol addiction so bad.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Heidi had never seen drug and alcohol addiction so bad.\nExplanation: Witnessing severe drug and alcohol addiction can be a traumatic experience, especially for someone who has never seen it before. It can be emotionally overwhelming and leave a lasting impact on a person's mental health. On the other hand, being frightened by a cat who licked her is unlikely to cause long-term trauma."}}
{"Q": "Craig has walked using crutches since he injured his leg. Which event could cause He decides never to leave home without crutches again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Craig ended up not using crutches and fell. (B) Craig decided to go out with his crutches and hurts himself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Craig decided to go out with his crutches and hurts himself.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly involves Craig's use of crutches and the consequences of not using them. If Craig were to end up not using his crutches and fall, it may not necessarily lead to him deciding never to leave home without them again. However, if he were to go out without his crutches and hurt himself, it would reinforce the importance of using them for his safety and mobility."}}
{"Q": "Amy and her friend Beth went to the park on a summer afternoon. Which event could cause They had no suits, so they weren't able to enter the water park?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy and Beth hated to go to the waterslide. (B) they saw the new water slide was open and wanted to try it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) they saw the new water slide was open and wanted to try it.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Amy and Beth wanted to go to the water park and were excited to try the new water slide. However, they were unable to enter because they did not have swimsuits. On the other hand, option (A) suggests that Amy and Beth did not want to go to the water park at all, which is less likely."}}
{"Q": "Donnie joined a gang to infiltrate them. Which event could cause Donnie is glad to be done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gang life was a bad way to live. (B) Donnie is still in the special forces.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Gang life was a bad way to live.\nExplanation: Donnie joined the gang with the intention of infiltrating them, not to become a permanent member. It is likely that he found the gang life to be dangerous and morally wrong, and is glad to be done with it now that his mission is complete. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is not related to Donnie's experience with the gang."}}
{"Q": "My dream school was Villanova University. Which event could cause In August, I went to Villanova and started my college life?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I applied to Ball State and was accepted. (B) I worked hard to get a scholarship there.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I worked hard to get a scholarship there.\nExplanation: Getting accepted to a dream school is one thing, but being able to afford it is another. It is more plausible that the event that led to starting college at Villanova was working hard to secure a scholarship, rather than randomly applying and being accepted to a different school. This shows determination and effort towards achieving the goal of attending Villanova."}}
{"Q": "Sue had a routine physical at her doctor's office. Which event could cause The results came back and she is very healthy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sue was nervous about the outcome of her tests. (B) The patient told her they had to run additional tests.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The patient told her they had to run additional tests.\nExplanation: If the doctor had found something concerning during the physical, they would likely need to run additional tests to confirm or rule out any issues. Therefore, if the results came back and Sue is very healthy, it is more plausible that the additional tests were just a precaution and not because there was a concern."}}
{"Q": "Kelly was spending time with her friend. Which event could cause Her friend was annoyed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly wouldn't leave her mom's house after the third day. (B) Kelly kept talking about her new boyfriend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that Kelly's friend would be annoyed if Kelly kept talking about her new boyfriend, as it could come across as self-centered and not allowing for a balanced conversation. On the other hand, staying at her mom's house for three days may not necessarily be annoying to her friend, depending on the circumstances."}}
{"Q": "Kim needed directions to a store. Which event could cause The phone had given her horribly wrong directions?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kim dialed a stranger for directions to the store. (B) She followed her GPS, but could not find the right store.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She followed her GPS, but could not find the right store.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the GPS gave her wrong directions rather than her randomly dialing a stranger for directions. GPS systems are known to sometimes give incorrect directions, especially if the address or location is not updated or if there are multiple stores with similar names in the area."}}
{"Q": "Jim was using a selfie stick. Which event could cause Jim eventually found it but it was destroyed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim lost his selfie stick. (B) Jim leaned the selfie stick out too far over the lake and dropped his floatie into the water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Option (B) is more plausible because it involves a specific event that could cause the destruction of the selfie stick. Option (A) simply states that Jim lost the selfie stick, but it doesn't explain how or why it was destroyed. Option (B) provides a clear scenario where Jim accidentally drops his floatie into the water while using the selfie stick, which could cause it to break or become damaged."}}
{"Q": "I took my pile of change to an exchange machine. Which event could cause I used the money I got from the machine?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I turned it in for play money. (B) I had saved up for a year.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I had saved up for a year.\nExplanation: It is more likely that someone would take their pile of change to an exchange machine after saving it up for a period of time, rather than turning it in for play money. Play money is typically used for games or entertainment purposes, whereas exchanging coins for bills is a practical way to turn loose change into usable currency."}}
{"Q": "Tina has two dogs. Which event could cause They became best friends and enjoy playing in the backyard together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tina had just gotten a puppy and was worried about how much work it would be. (B) Tina lets the dogs run around in her backyard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tina lets the dogs run around in her backyard.\nExplanation: Allowing the dogs to play together in the backyard provides an opportunity for them to bond and become friends. Option (A) does not provide any reason for the dogs to become friends, and it is unlikely that Tina's worry about the new puppy would have any impact on the dogs' relationship. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I let my dog outside to go to the bathroom. Which event could cause I then dried him off and relaxed with my clean dog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He played in the sprinklers. (B) My dog jumped in a sand pit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that the dog played in the sprinklers and got wet, rather than jumping in a sand pit and getting dirty. Additionally, the act of drying off the dog suggests that he got wet, rather than dirty."}}
{"Q": "The library at Ben's town was hosting a readathon for prizes. Which event could cause A few days later, he learned that he won the the prize?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ben forgot about the readathon. (B) Ben entered and prayed to win.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Ben entered and read a lot during the readathon.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Ben won the prize because he participated in the readathon and read a lot, rather than forgetting about it or relying solely on prayer to win. Winning a prize usually requires some effort or action on the part of the participant."}}
{"Q": "Kate wanted to buy a new keyboard for her computer. Which event could cause Then her keyboard arrived in the mail?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kate's boyfriend knew about it and ordered one online. (B) Kate shopped in the mall where it was cheaper.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Kate shopped in the mall and bought a new keyboard, then it is likely that she would have provided her address for shipping. Therefore, her keyboard would arrive in the mail after the purchase. On the other hand, there is no indication that Kate's boyfriend knew about her desire for a new keyboard or that he would order one online for her."}}
{"Q": "Mable knew she couldn't mow her lawn at her advanced age. Which event could cause Mable shed a tear from the boy's kindness?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So the boy came over with his lawn mower and helped. (B) A boy forced Mable to mow the lawn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mable would shed a tear from the boy's kindness in helping her mow the lawn, rather than being forced to do it by a boy. The first option shows a compassionate act, while the second option shows a negative and unlikely scenario."}}
{"Q": "Tammy needed money badly. Which event could cause She made lots of money and ended up happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tammy got a new job. (B) Tammy got a job where she met lots of people.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Tammy needing money implies that she was likely unemployed or not making enough money at her current job. Getting a new job would provide a more stable source of income and potentially higher pay, which would alleviate her financial stress and make her happy. Meeting lots of people at a job may be enjoyable, but it does not necessarily guarantee making lots of money and being happy."}}
{"Q": "Fred wanted to take Sally on a fun date. Which event could cause Since she had so much fun, Sally said yes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) fred asked sally to get lost. (B) fred want to go dancing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that Sally would say yes to going dancing with Fred, as it is a fun and enjoyable activity. Option A, where Fred asks Sally to get lost, would not result in Sally saying yes to a date."}}
{"Q": "Kyle dreaded starting high school. Which event could cause Kyle found that her masculine name wasn't uncool - it was popular?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kyle was a gender non-conforming kid. (B) Kyle thought he would be teased.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Kyle thought he would be teased for having a masculine name, it would make sense that he would dread starting high school. However, if he found that his name was actually popular, it could boost his confidence and make him feel more comfortable in his own skin. Option A is also a possibility, but it is not explicitly stated in the question and therefore cannot be assumed as the correct answer."}}
{"Q": "Nell's gym teacher asked the class to do calisthenics. Which event could cause The teacher told the class she used to weigh 400 pounds?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The class did the calisthenics and were physically exhausted. (B) She hid what calisthenics did for her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: The fact that the gym teacher used to weigh 400 pounds is not related to the class doing calisthenics and being physically exhausted. Therefore, option (A) is not a plausible answer. Option (B) is more plausible because it suggests that the gym teacher may have hidden the benefits of calisthenics from the class, possibly because she did not want to reveal her past struggles with weight."}}
{"Q": "After the blizzard, I didn't know how I was going to shovel anything. Which event could cause So today, I borrowed his shovel and cleaned up the sidewalk?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My neighbor took it upon himself to clean up the sidewalk, allowing me to get to my bus and work on time. (B) I had no shovel, but I bought one from someone who did.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it directly addresses the problem of not having a shovel. Option A is possible, but it relies on the neighbor taking the initiative to clean the sidewalk, which may not always happen. Option B shows the protagonist taking action to solve their problem by purchasing a shovel from someone who already had one."}}
{"Q": "Allan is the pastor of the First Baptist Church in his town. Which event could cause We all sang The Old Rugged Cross instead of Happy Birthday?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided he wanted to sing Happy Birthday no matter what. (B) Allan led the service on Sunday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Allan led the service on Sunday.\nExplanation: As the pastor of the First Baptist Church, Allan would be responsible for leading the service on Sunday. It is possible that he chose to include the hymn \"The Old Rugged Cross\" in the service instead of singing \"Happy Birthday\" for a specific reason, such as it being a special occasion or a request from a member of the congregation. It is unlikely that Allan would randomly decide to sing \"Happy Birthday\" instead of following the usual order of service without a valid reason."}}
{"Q": "Ann loved cake. Which event could cause Ann felt insulted by the lady's offer?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ann gave the lady cake. (B) The lady gave Ann the free cake for a favor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Ann loved cake, it is unlikely that she would feel insulted by receiving cake as a gift. However, if the lady offered Ann a free cake in exchange for a favor, Ann may feel insulted as it implies that she can be bought or that her help is not valued enough to be given without compensation."}}
{"Q": "Neil had been journeying through Asia. Which event could cause His favorite moment was when he got to feed a baby koala bear?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Neil especially loved the flora and the fauna he had seen in China. (B) He stopped to take several pictures.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Neil visited a wildlife sanctuary in Australia where he was able to feed a baby koala bear.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because koalas are native to Australia, not Asia. It is also a common activity for tourists to visit wildlife sanctuaries in Australia where they can interact with and feed koalas."}}
{"Q": "Timmy was jealous as he watched breakdancers on TV. Which event could cause Now Timmy is on TV breakdancing?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Timmy watched videos on Youtube to learn to sing. (B) timmy worked on becoming a breakdancer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Timmy worked on becoming a breakdancer rather than learning to sing from Youtube videos. Becoming a breakdancer requires physical practice and training, while learning to sing from Youtube videos may not necessarily lead to being on TV as a breakdancer."}}
{"Q": "A fisherman was having no luck in one part of the lake. Which event could cause It landed with a splash and the fisherman waited?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fisherman went to a different area. (B) The fisherman wasn't able to catch a fish in forever.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The fisherman went to a different area.\nExplanation: If the fisherman wasn't having any luck in one part of the lake, it would make sense for them to try a different area where there may be more fish. The fact that the fish landed with a splash suggests that the fisherman had success in the new area. Option B is not a plausible answer as it doesn't provide any explanation for why the fisherman suddenly caught a fish."}}
{"Q": "Peter laces his shoes with only black laces. Which event could cause Peter won the lottery and is now retired at 45?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Peter decided not to try out for the lottery. (B) Peter bought a lottery ticket one day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Peter bought a lottery ticket one day.\nExplanation: Winning the lottery is a matter of chance and luck, and buying a lottery ticket is the only way to participate in the lottery. Therefore, it is more plausible that Peter won the lottery after buying a ticket rather than deciding not to try out for it."}}
{"Q": "Tom was a bull rider by trade. Which event could cause Every night he couldn't wait for the next day to ride once again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He kept getting thrown off by the bull. (B) Horse riding was also his passion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Horse riding was also his passion.\nExplanation: If Tom was passionate about horse riding, it is more likely that he would look forward to riding every day, rather than being thrown off by a bull. Additionally, if he kept getting thrown off by the bull, it would likely cause frustration and discouragement rather than excitement for the next day's ride."}}
{"Q": "Brad was gazing in the fountain downtown. Which event could cause Then Brad walked away, whistling happily?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Brad made a wish on a shooting star. (B) Brad made a wish with a penny.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Brad made a wish with a penny.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Brad made a wish with a penny in the fountain, as this is a common tradition and superstition. Whistling happily after making a wish with a penny is also a common behavior associated with this tradition. Making a wish on a shooting star is less likely to occur in a downtown area with bright lights and pollution."}}
{"Q": "Dan needed a new router. Which event could cause The router worked excellently and Dan was happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan went to the store to get a table. (B) Dan went to the store to get a router.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Dan went to the store to specifically get a new router, which would then replace his old, potentially faulty one. If he successfully found and purchased a new router, and it worked excellently, then he would be happy with his purchase. Going to the store to get a table would not have any impact on the performance of his router."}}
{"Q": "Ida had a falling out with her friends. Which event could cause Her friends forgave her and became her friends again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ida was kind to her friends. (B) After a few days, Ida went up to her friends and apologized for what she said.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) After a few days, Ida went up to her friends and apologized for what she said.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Ida's friends would forgive her and become her friends again if she apologized for what she said and showed remorse for her actions. Being kind to her friends may help, but a sincere apology is more likely to repair the damage done to the friendship."}}
{"Q": "Martha was a terrible cook and her boyfriend knew it. Which event could cause Martha became an expert seamstress after a while?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Martha's boyfriend suggested she learn sewing instead. (B) Martha practiced her cooking.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Martha's boyfriend suggested she learn sewing instead.\nExplanation: There is no direct correlation between practicing cooking and becoming an expert seamstress. However, if Martha's boyfriend suggested she learn sewing instead, she may have taken an interest in it and practiced it regularly, leading to her becoming an expert seamstress over time."}}
{"Q": "While I was in college, I had met an older man. Which event could cause I have fond memories of that time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He helped me flunk out of all my classes. (B) I went on several dates and eventually married the older man.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I went on several dates and eventually married the older man.\nExplanation: This option suggests a positive outcome from the relationship with the older man, which could lead to fond memories. Option (A) suggests a negative outcome, which would not likely result in fond memories."}}
{"Q": "Brad stops and gets a 44 oz mountain dew every day. Which event could cause Brad passes away?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Brad had a really bad diabetes. (B) Brad suffers from diabetes at a young age, but never gives up his habit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Consuming a 44 oz mountain dew every day can lead to high sugar intake, which can cause diabetes. If Brad already had diabetes and continued to consume such a high amount of sugar every day, it could lead to severe health complications and potentially cause his passing. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Peanut was a hungry pitbull. Which event could cause Peanut is not hungry anymore?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Peanut's owners forgot to give him food. (B) Peanut ate his food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Peanut ate his food.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Peanut is not hungry anymore because he ate his food. Pitbulls are known to have a big appetite and once they eat, they tend to feel full and satisfied. It is unlikely that Peanut's owners forgot to give him food as they are responsible for his well-being and would not neglect his basic needs."}}
{"Q": "Fred and his girlfriend rose were happy it was Valentine's Day. Which event could cause The two then went for a walk in the park?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fred and his girlfriend broke up. (B) Fred and his girlfriend went to dinner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Fred and his girlfriend went to dinner.\nExplanation: Since it was Valentine's Day, it is more likely that Fred and his girlfriend would celebrate the occasion by going out for a romantic dinner. This is a common way for couples to celebrate Valentine's Day, and it would make sense for them to then take a walk in the park afterwards to enjoy the evening. On the other hand, if they had broken up, it is unlikely that they would be spending time together and going for a walk in the park."}}
{"Q": "One day a stranger came to our farm. Which event could cause The next morning the man was gone but so were two of our horses?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The man seemed nice, and even agreed to help Pa fix the fence. (B) He seemed trustworthy but I was trusting of him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that the man seemed trustworthy and that the narrator was trusting of him suggests that the man may have taken advantage of their trust and stolen the horses. The fact that he helped Pa fix the fence could have been a ploy to gain their trust and access to the horses."}}
{"Q": "Al rode his bike to the store for candy. Which event could cause That night, Al cheered himself up by gorging on candy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) While on his way home, someone stole all of Al's candy. (B) Al fell off his bike and scraped his knee on the way home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If someone stole all of Al's candy, it would make sense that he would want to cheer himself up by eating more candy later that night. Falling off his bike and scraping his knee may cause him to be in pain or upset, but it is less likely to lead to him gorging on candy as a way to cheer himself up."}}
{"Q": "Sarah did not get a good night's sleep. Which event could cause She woke up feeling much better?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sarah decided to go to bed later. (B) Sarah decided to go to bed earlier.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sarah decided to go to bed earlier.\nExplanation: If Sarah did not get a good night's sleep, it is likely that she did not get enough sleep or had poor quality sleep. Going to bed earlier would give her more time to sleep and potentially improve the quality of her sleep, leading to her waking up feeling much better. Going to bed later would likely only exacerbate the problem and make her feel worse in the morning."}}
{"Q": "Ricky fell while hiking in the woods. Which event could cause He was relieved to find out he was wrong?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ricky thought his ankle had been sprained, but the doctor said it was broken. (B) Rick thought he had broken his ankle, but it was only sprained.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Rick thought he had broken his ankle, but it was only sprained.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it aligns with the relief that Ricky felt. If he had thought his ankle was sprained but it turned out to be broken, he would not have felt relieved. However, if he thought it was broken but it turned out to be only sprained, he would have felt relieved that the injury was not as severe as he initially thought."}}
{"Q": "A man wanted to send text messages faster. Which event could cause He soon improved his texting speed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found an app that helped text whole words. (B) He practiced calling more.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He found an app that helped text whole words.\nExplanation: Finding an app that helps text whole words would be a more plausible answer as it directly addresses the man's desire to send text messages faster. This app would allow him to type out full words with just a few keystrokes, saving him time and increasing his texting speed. Practicing calling more may improve his communication skills, but it would not necessarily improve his texting speed."}}
{"Q": "Charles was an everyday type of guy. Which event could cause He proved his innocence in court and is back from jail after 3 months?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Charles looked like wanted criminal. (B) Charles was a victim of robbery.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Charles looked like a wanted criminal, he could have been mistakenly identified and arrested. Proving his innocence in court would clear his name and allow him to be released from jail after 3 months. On the other hand, being a victim of robbery would not necessarily result in Charles being arrested and sent to jail."}}
{"Q": "Nancy had a problem with her bad breath. Which event could cause After the visit, her breath improved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She started using breath mints. (B) Nancy visited the dentist and got her teeth cleaned.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Nancy visited the dentist and got her teeth cleaned.\nExplanation: Bad breath can be caused by a buildup of bacteria in the mouth, which can be removed through regular dental cleanings. Using breath mints may temporarily mask the odor, but it would not address the underlying cause of the bad breath. Therefore, it is more plausible that Nancy's breath improved after visiting the dentist and getting her teeth cleaned."}}
{"Q": "Maggie was on a fun trip to the beach. Which event could cause She ended up missing out on the whole trip?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Maggie fell and sprained her ankle. (B) Maggie got sick on her last day there and had to stay in her room.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Maggie fell and sprained her ankle.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Maggie missing out on the whole trip was caused by an injury rather than getting sick on the last day. If Maggie sprained her ankle, she would not be able to participate in any of the beach activities and would have to stay in her room to rest and recover. On the other hand, if she got sick on the last day, she would have still been able to enjoy the majority of her trip."}}
{"Q": "Tina had to write a great essay to get into college. Which event could cause She was delighted to hear the college had accepted her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She spent weeks writing her essay. (B) Tina wrote an excellent essay for a school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Tina wrote an excellent essay for a school.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the outcome of being accepted into college. Spending weeks writing an essay does not guarantee acceptance, and it is possible to spend less time and still write an excellent essay. Therefore, the quality of the essay is a more likely factor in Tina's acceptance."}}
{"Q": "The family decided to take a trip to the beach one hot summer day. Which event could cause Low and behold the neighbors parked next to them, excited to see them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It started raining so they went to museum instead. (B) They saw the neighbors unpacking their vehicle too.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They saw the neighbors unpacking their vehicle too.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is common for people to run into their neighbors while on vacation or at popular tourist destinations. It is unlikely that a sudden rainstorm would cause the neighbors to park next to them and be excited to see them."}}
{"Q": "It was 10 PM on a summer night. Which event could cause Unable to sleep, Gina lay in bed with nothing to do?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) But it was so cold it was easy to sleep. (B) Gina's strict bedtime was 9:30 PM, even in summer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option A is not a plausible answer as it contradicts the statement that Gina was unable to sleep. Option B is more plausible as it suggests that Gina's strict bedtime routine may have caused her to feel restless and unable to sleep past her usual bedtime."}}
{"Q": "Jake was walking home from school. Which event could cause Jake ran home he was fine but frightened?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jake was chased by a dog. (B) Jake saw some friends down the street.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jake was chased by a dog.\nExplanation: Being chased by a dog is a common fear for many people, especially children. It is a plausible event that could cause Jake to run home while feeling frightened. On the other hand, seeing some friends down the street is not likely to cause fear or a need to run home."}}
{"Q": "Kyle collected many things. Which event could cause Kyle was really into Marvel heros?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kyle read a Marvel comic. (B) Kyle gave away his marvel action figures.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Kyle read a Marvel comic.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kyle became interested in Marvel heroes after reading a Marvel comic, as comics are a common way for people to become interested in superheroes. Giving away his Marvel action figures would suggest that he lost interest in them, rather than becoming more interested."}}
{"Q": "A man looked at a rock face and decided to climb it. Which event could cause The man climbed faster to get off the mountain as soon as possible?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rocks were coming up it. (B) He was getting tired and wanted to be done.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If rocks were coming up the rock face, it would be a dangerous situation and the man would want to climb faster to avoid being hit by falling rocks or debris. On the other hand, getting tired and wanting to be done is a common feeling during climbing, but it wouldn't necessarily cause the man to climb faster."}}
{"Q": "Eric went to a restaurant with his girlfriend. Which event could cause Eric's girlfriend broke her tooth on the ring, but said yes?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eric and his girlfriend got into a fight and broke up. (B) Eric had the waiter bury an engagement ring in the bread pudding dessert.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because it involves the girlfriend breaking her tooth on the ring, but still saying yes to Eric's proposal. Option A does not provide any explanation for how the girlfriend broke her tooth on the ring, and it is unlikely that she would say yes to a proposal after such a negative event. Option B suggests that Eric had planned a surprise proposal by burying the ring in the dessert, but the girlfriend accidentally bit into it and broke her tooth. Despite the mishap, she still said yes to Eric's proposal."}}
{"Q": "Nina wanted a nice Halloween costume. Which event could cause Nina was excited?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nina bought a witch costume. (B) She found one that she found alright.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Nina bought a witch costume.\nExplanation: Since Nina wanted a nice Halloween costume, it is more plausible that she would be excited if she found a costume that she really liked and bought it. Buying a costume would indicate that she found something that met her expectations and made her happy. On the other hand, finding a costume that she found alright may not necessarily make her excited."}}
{"Q": "Ed the waiter took an order from a table. Which event could cause The man inspected one to see if it was crispy enough and it was?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The patron requested extra crispy fries. (B) The waiter brought salad.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The patron requested extra crispy fries.\nExplanation: If the patron specifically requested extra crispy fries, it would make sense for him to inspect one to ensure that they met his expectations. On the other hand, the arrival of salad would not be related to the crispiness of the fries."}}
{"Q": "Andrew wanted to plant an apple tree. Which event could cause Andrew was glad to see the tree growing in his backyard?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Andrew bought seeds but did not water the plant. (B) Andrew planted a seed from an apple.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Andrew planted a seed from an apple, which is the most plausible answer as it is the correct way to grow an apple tree. If he did not water the plant, the seed would not have grown, so option A is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ron wanted to get some fresh produce. Which event could cause Spaghetti squash turned out to be the best discovery he had ever had?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He had read about making plain squash. (B) Ron purchased spaghetti squash.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Ron purchased spaghetti squash.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because Ron actually tried the spaghetti squash and discovered that it was the best discovery he had ever had. Reading about making plain squash may have given him some ideas, but it wouldn't necessarily lead to him discovering spaghetti squash specifically."}}
{"Q": "I went to my favorite candy store Which event could cause I have to decided to only eat candy in small amounts from now on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I got sick from eating not enough candy. (B) The price of my favorite candy was very high.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The price of the favorite candy being very high is a more plausible reason for deciding to eat candy in small amounts from now on. Getting sick from not eating enough candy is unlikely as it is not a common occurrence, and it is more likely that overeating candy would cause sickness. However, if the price of the favorite candy was very high, it could be a deterrent to consuming large amounts of it, leading to a decision to eat it in smaller amounts."}}
{"Q": "Ally heard chirping coming from the tree by the deck. Which event could cause She watched out the window as the mother came back to the nest?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ally looked outside to see unsupervised babies. (B) She saw a nest of swarming bees.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Ally watched out the window as the mother came back to the nest.\nExplanation: The chirping sound coming from the tree suggests that there are baby birds in the nest. It is common for mother birds to leave the nest to search for food and then return to feed their young. Therefore, it is more plausible that Ally saw the mother bird returning to the nest rather than unsupervised babies or a nest of swarming bees."}}
{"Q": "My wife needed a pair of boots for the winter. Which event could cause Then she bought four more pairs?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When my wife went to the shoe store she found a deal on boot for me. (B) When I went to the store I found a deal on boots for me.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The event that could cause my wife to buy four more pairs of boots is when she went to the shoe store and found a deal on boots for herself. It is more plausible that my wife would buy more boots for herself if she found a good deal, rather than me finding a deal on boots for myself."}}
{"Q": "I just completed my first marathon today. Which event could cause I'm really disappointed in myself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I've trained before but couldn't walk the entire way. (B) I never trained before that and walked the entire way.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the person had trained before but still couldn't walk the entire way, they may feel disappointed in themselves for not being able to meet their own expectations despite putting in effort and time to prepare for the marathon. On the other hand, if they never trained before and still managed to walk the entire way, they may feel proud of themselves for completing the marathon despite not having prior training."}}
{"Q": "It was Jay's 26th birthday, and it started off like any other day. Which event could cause He could not believe it when they all surprised him with the gift?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jay's friends surprised him with a big gift. (B) Jay's friends got tickets for his rival sports team.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jay's friends surprised him with a big gift.\nExplanation: Since it was Jay's birthday, it is more plausible that his friends would surprise him with a gift rather than getting tickets for his rival sports team. Additionally, the statement \"He could not believe it\" suggests that the surprise was something unexpected and significant, which is more likely to be a big gift rather than sports tickets."}}
{"Q": "Beth is one of the best runners on her track team. Which event could cause Beth regrets not being more focused and letting her team down?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Beth met a boy and they practiced together. (B) Beth's mood was bad today and she didn't go running.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Beth's mood was bad today and she didn't go running.\nExplanation: If Beth didn't go running because of her bad mood, she could have missed an important practice or even a competition. This could have let her team down and caused her to regret not being more focused on her responsibilities as a runner. While practicing with a boy may be a distraction, it is not necessarily a situation that would cause Beth to regret letting her team down."}}
{"Q": "Tyler's dad took him to a baseball game. Which event could cause Once he got his hotdog, he was happy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was not impressed by the game. (B) Tyler is so energized and hungry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tyler is so energized and hungry.\nExplanation: It is common for people to feel hungry and energized after physical activity or excitement, such as watching a baseball game. Therefore, it is more plausible that Tyler's hunger and excitement caused him to be happy after getting his hotdog, rather than him being unimpressed by the game."}}
{"Q": "When Johnny received his journalism degree he doubted he'd find a job. Which event could cause The editor offered him a reporting position that same day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Johnny got refused and interview with an editor. (B) When Johnny met with Sublime Ink he was hired the day after his interview.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The editor offered him a reporting position that same day.\nExplanation: This event is the most plausible because it directly contradicts Johnny's initial doubt about finding a job. If he had been refused an interview or hired by a different company the day after his degree, it would not have addressed his initial concern. However, being offered a job by an editor on the same day he received his degree would be a surprising and fortunate turn of events."}}
{"Q": "Linda was sketching in public. Which event could cause But she felt devastated when she overheard comments about her sketch?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) People criticized Lindas sketch. (B) Linda prevented herself from eavesdropping on the next table over.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If people criticized Linda's sketch, it would be a plausible reason for her to feel devastated upon overhearing their comments. On the other hand, Linda preventing herself from eavesdropping on the next table over would not have any direct impact on her sketch or her feelings about it."}}
{"Q": "Kat loved to play with insects. Which event could cause Kat then decided it'd be best to leave the moths be?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kate killed the insects. (B) Kat got hugged by a moth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kat would change her mind about playing with moths if she had a personal experience with one, such as getting hugged by one, rather than if she had killed them. This personal experience could have made her realize that moths are living creatures that deserve respect and should not be harmed."}}
{"Q": "Our two year old granddaughter is visiting from New York this weekend. Which event could cause My wife is thrilled to see our first grandchild?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My wife bought new child clothes. (B) Since my wife and I live with her, we see her every day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Since my wife and I live with her, we see her every day.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the excitement of seeing their first grandchild is due to the fact that they do not get to see her often since she lives in New York. Buying new child clothes may also be exciting, but it is not necessarily the main reason for the excitement of seeing their granddaughter."}}
{"Q": "Cindy is a tennis player. Which event could cause Cindy won the challenge?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Cindy practiced once a month for a competition. (B) Cindy practiced everyday for a competition.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Cindy practicing everyday for a competition is a more plausible answer because consistent practice and training can improve her skills and increase her chances of winning the challenge. Practicing only once a month may not be enough to maintain or improve her level of play."}}
{"Q": "Felix was playing in the school playground. Which event could cause After a few hours, Felix began to feel a little better?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Felix fell off the wing. (B) Felix played all day and had tons of fun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Felix fell off the swing, it is possible that he may have gotten hurt or injured himself. After a few hours, he may have received medical attention or simply rested, which could have caused him to feel a little better. On the other hand, if Felix played all day and had tons of fun, it is unlikely that he would feel better after just a few hours, as he would likely be tired and worn out. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom was skiing for the first time. Which event could cause He was a little shaky, but he got off the t-bar without falling?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom decided to give up. (B) Tom was very nervous.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tom was very nervous.\nExplanation: It is common for first-time skiers to feel nervous and shaky, especially when using a t-bar lift for the first time. However, if Tom had decided to give up, he would not have made it off the lift without falling. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jim was at Costco. Which event could cause He ate so much that he skipped dinner that night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They had no samples. (B) Jim loved free samples.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Jim loved free samples.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Jim indulged in the free samples at Costco and ate so much that he was too full to eat dinner later. It is a common occurrence for people to overeat at Costco due to the abundance of free samples available. On the other hand, the answer (A) that they had no samples does not provide a logical reason for Jim to skip dinner."}}
{"Q": "I had a science test yesterday and was so nervous. Which event could cause However to my surprise the test wasn't that bad?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I took the science test. (B) I almost made myself sing from the nerves.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I took the science test.\nExplanation: Taking the science test is the most plausible event that could cause the surprise that the test wasn't that bad. The nervousness before the test could have made the person think that the test would be difficult, but actually taking the test and realizing it wasn't as bad as expected would be a pleasant surprise. Option B, almost making oneself sing from nerves, does not directly relate to the outcome of the test and is less likely to cause the surprise mentioned in the question."}}
{"Q": "Lydia had a strange dream last night. Which event could cause Lydia felt relieved when she realized it was just a dream?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lydia dreamed she was married to her awful ex-boyfriend. (B) Lydia dreamed she was married to a sexy actor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Lydia would feel relieved when she realized that she was not actually married to her awful ex-boyfriend. This is a more plausible answer because dreaming about being married to someone you dislike or have a negative history with can be a source of anxiety and stress. Dreaming about being married to a sexy actor may be a pleasant dream, but it is less likely to cause relief when realizing it was just a dream."}}
{"Q": "Sammy was at an outdoor mall and was starting to feel hungry. Which event could cause After Sammy finished eating there, she left feeling regretful?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sammy went to get food. (B) Sammy's friend decided to go to a sketchy buffet where the food looked questionable.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Sammy's friend decided to go to a sketchy buffet where the food looked questionable, it is more likely that Sammy would regret eating there due to the potential for food poisoning or other health issues. Choosing to get food in general does not necessarily lead to regret, as it depends on the specific food and location chosen."}}
{"Q": "Amy hadn't slept well. Which event could cause Her mother saw her and yelled at her for drinking coffee?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy snuck into the kitchen and made herself carrot and celery sticks. (B) needing to stay awake, she decided to drink a cup of coffee.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) needing to stay awake, she decided to drink a cup of coffee.\nExplanation: If Amy hadn't slept well, she may have felt the need to stay awake and alert. Drinking coffee is a common way to achieve this, especially if she had something important to do that day. Her mother's reaction to seeing her drinking coffee suggests that it may not be something Amy is allowed to do, which could explain why she didn't sleep well in the first place. Sneaking into the kitchen to make carrot and celery sticks seems like an unlikely event to cause her mother to yell at her."}}
{"Q": "I came into class late one day. Which event could cause I did not get a very good grade on it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I had been busy writing a great research paper. (B) I missed the project instructions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. I missed the project instructions.\nExplanation: If you came into class late and missed the project instructions, it is likely that you did not fully understand what was expected of you and may have missed important details or requirements. This could result in a lower grade on the project. While writing a great research paper could be a valid reason for a lower grade on a different assignment, it does not necessarily explain why you did not do well on the specific assignment you missed instructions for."}}
{"Q": "Fred woke up early. Which event could cause Fred spent the rest of his day watching old movies?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Fred decided to call out sick. (B) Fred felt lazy and spent the day at home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Fred decided to call out sick.\nExplanation: If Fred woke up early but then decided to call out sick, it is more plausible that he would spend the rest of his day at home watching old movies. On the other hand, if he simply felt lazy and stayed home, he may still have other things to do or errands to run."}}
{"Q": "Bob began to lay tile in his bathroom as a part of remodeling. Which event could cause Bob bought different tiles and hoped that no one would notice?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bob ran out of the exact color. (B) Some of the tiles were new.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Bob ran out of the exact color of tiles he needed and had to buy a different color to finish the job. It is unlikely that he would buy completely different tiles and hope that no one would notice, especially if he was remodeling his own bathroom and would have to live with the result."}}
{"Q": "Alana was traveling with the the girls to the islands. Which event could cause It was supposed to be a girls trip and the husband wasn't welcome?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One of Alana's friends left her husband behind. (B) Their husbands were not invited.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it specifically mentions that one of Alana's friends left her husband behind, indicating that the other friends may have brought their husbands if they wanted to. Option B is also a possibility, but it is less likely as it implies that none of the girls' husbands were invited, which would be an unusual circumstance for a girls' trip."}}
{"Q": "We had a museum poster on our wall for Years. Which event could cause We put the old poster up in our bedroom?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The old museum poster was left at the old house when we moved. (B) We loved it so much we took it us when we moved.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) We loved it so much we took it with us when we moved.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the poster was taken intentionally because the statement says \"we had a museum poster on our wall for years,\" indicating that the poster was valued and displayed for a long time. Additionally, the statement does not mention anything about forgetting the poster or leaving it behind, making option (A) less likely."}}
{"Q": "Ivan went to the zoo. Which event could cause Ivan climbed up and rode the elephant happily?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They asked if Ivan wanted to ride an horse. (B) he saw many different animals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) They asked if Ivan wanted to ride a horse.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ivan rode the elephant because he was given the opportunity to do so, rather than just seeing different animals. Riding an elephant is a unique and exciting experience that many people would not want to pass up if given the chance. Additionally, the fact that Ivan rode the elephant happily suggests that he was excited about the opportunity, rather than just casually observing the animals."}}
{"Q": "Gina had been out of town for 2 weeks at her grandmother's house. Which event could cause Gina hadn't realized how much she missed in 2 weeks without cable?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina loved watching television at her grandmother's. (B) She didn't have a lot to do at her house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Gina loved watching television at her grandmother's house, it is more likely that she would have missed cable and realized how much she missed it when she returned home. On the other hand, if she didn't have a lot to do at her house, she may have found other ways to occupy her time and not necessarily missed cable."}}
{"Q": "Cheyenne tried to keep up with her friend David as they walked. Which event could cause David was the only one who knew his way back to the car?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was important that Cheyenne not lose sight of David. (B) Cheyenne departed back and got separated from David.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Cheyenne departed back and got separated from David.\nExplanation: If Cheyenne got separated from David, she would not be able to keep up with him and would have difficulty finding her way back to the car without his guidance. This would be a plausible reason for her struggle to keep up with him. Option (A) is not a likely cause for her difficulty keeping up with David, as it does not explain why she would have trouble following him specifically."}}
{"Q": "Frederick Thompson, a white kid, knew blacks used to be in slavery. Which event could cause Frederick started the History of Slavery in America Club on his campus?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Frederick was pleased more everytime he read about it. (B) Frederick was bothered more everytime he read about it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Frederick was bothered more every time he read about slavery, it is more likely that he would want to start a club to educate himself and others about the history of slavery in America. It shows that he is aware of the injustices that occurred and wants to take action to learn more and potentially make a difference. If he was pleased every time he read about it, it would be less likely that he would feel the need to start a club to further explore the topic."}}
{"Q": "Kelley wished she could draw a beautiful horse for her mother. Which event could cause Kelly now has a beautiful horse picture to give to her mother?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelley worked really hard to practice her ballet. (B) Kelley drew a horse fro her mom.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The most plausible answer is that Kelley drew a horse for her mom, as this directly addresses her wish to have a beautiful horse picture to give to her mother. Practicing ballet (choice A) does not relate to Kelley's desire to draw a horse, and therefore is not a likely cause for her having a horse picture to give to her mother."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to make some wine. Which event could cause Alas, it tasted poor?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I looked up the recipe but decided not to make it. (B) I made some from a recipe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I made some from a recipe.\nExplanation: Making wine involves a complex process that requires precise measurements and timing. If any step is not followed correctly, it can result in poor-tasting wine. Therefore, making wine from a recipe and not following the instructions correctly could cause the wine to taste poor."}}
{"Q": "Devin was swimming in the ocean. Which event could cause He had his friend urinate on him to fix it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Devin was stung by a jellyfish. (B) Devin got a barnacle from the water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: When someone is stung by a jellyfish, the tentacles can release venom that causes a burning sensation and pain. One common remedy is to have someone urinate on the affected area, as the ammonia in urine can neutralize the venom. While it may seem strange, this is a well-known and often effective treatment for jellyfish stings. On the other hand, getting a barnacle from the water would not require someone to urinate on you to fix it."}}
{"Q": "I get to go to the mall today. Which event could cause My shopping trip was a success?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I had plenty of back to school clothes. (B) I need some back to school clothes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I had plenty of back to school clothes.\nExplanation: If the person had plenty of back to school clothes after their shopping trip, it would indicate that they were able to find what they needed and were satisfied with their purchases, making their shopping trip a success. Option B suggests that the person still needs to find clothes, which would not be considered a successful shopping trip."}}
{"Q": "Kelly really needed some new headphones. Which event could cause They were great?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly purchased some from the zoo. (B) Kelly spent all day researching quite ones to buy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Kelly spent all day researching and found some good quality headphones to purchase, it is more likely that they would be great. Purchasing headphones from the zoo does not necessarily guarantee their quality."}}
{"Q": "Becca was an awesome singer. Which event could cause Becca's mom cried at her daughter's amazing display?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Becca was too scared to sing in public. (B) Becca performed a duet with her classmate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Becca's mom cried at her daughter's amazing display, it is more plausible that it was due to Becca being too scared to sing in public. This could be a moment of pride for her mom, seeing her daughter overcome her fear and perform well. On the other hand, performing a duet with a classmate may not necessarily evoke tears of joy from Becca's mom, unless it was a particularly emotional or meaningful performance."}}
{"Q": "Tim had no free time for himself because of his long hours at work. Which event could cause He returned to work rejuvenated and well rested?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided to take a few days off for a work conference. (B) Tim decided that he needed a vacation.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Tim took a few days off for a work conference, it is possible that he could have used that time to relax and recharge. Conferences often have breaks and downtime, which could have allowed Tim to take some time for himself. Additionally, attending a conference could have given him new ideas and inspiration, making him feel more motivated and energized when he returned to work. On the other hand, if Tim simply took a vacation, it is possible that he could have returned feeling more tired or stressed if he did not use the time off effectively."}}
{"Q": "Carla smelt something burning in the next room. Which event could cause The roommate checked her mini oven, crumbs were burning on her tray?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Carla asked the roommate if she wanted dinner. (B) Carla went to the room.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Carla went to the room.\nExplanation: If Carla smelt something burning in the next room, it is more likely that she would go to the room to investigate the source of the smell. Option (A) does not seem plausible as asking the roommate if she wanted dinner would not necessarily lead to the discovery of the burning crumbs."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy's parents got a new dishwasher. Which event could cause Finally them made it into a space ship?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jimmy's parents donated the old dishwasher to charity. (B) His parents decided to make the dishwasher box into a toy for Jimmy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His parents decided to make the dishwasher box into a toy for Jimmy.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jimmy's parents would repurpose the dishwasher box into a toy for their child rather than suddenly turning it into a spaceship. Donating the old dishwasher to charity is also a possible event, but it is not related to the idea of turning the box into a spaceship."}}
{"Q": "Kendrick uses his fireplace often. Which event could cause Kendrick now really appreciates his fireplace?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kendrick cleaned up his fireplace. (B) In the summer Kendrick used it to cool his home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Kendrick cleaned up his fireplace, he would have likely noticed the difference in the efficiency and warmth of the fireplace. This would make him appreciate it more, as it would be functioning better and providing more heat. Using the fireplace to cool his home in the summer (option B) does not make sense, as fireplaces are typically used for heating, not cooling."}}
{"Q": "Sammy wanted to surprise his girlfriend. Which event could cause It meant he remembered her talking about how much she liked them?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sammy, brought his girlfriend socks. (B) Sammy got his girlfriend she always talked about.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Sammy's girlfriend had talked about something she always wanted, it would make more sense for him to surprise her with that item rather than socks. Socks may be a nice gesture, but they are not typically something someone would express a strong desire for."}}
{"Q": "Dan was about to travel to meet his parents this weekend. Which event could cause Dan was upset that he could not find his passport anywhere?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan did not know where his suitcase was. (B) Dan needed a passport to travel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Dan needed a passport to travel, so not being able to find it would cause him to be upset and potentially unable to make the trip. The fact that he didn't know where his suitcase was may also be a cause for concern, but it wouldn't necessarily prevent him from traveling as long as he had his passport."}}
{"Q": "I went to a piano concert and fell in love with the instrument. Which event could cause I finally had my own piano concert after all that work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I decided to take piano lessons after the concert. (B) I started taking lessons and practiced sometimes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If the person decided to take piano lessons after the concert, it would be more likely that they would work towards having their own piano concert. Taking lessons would provide them with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform in front of an audience. While practicing is important, it is not the only factor in being able to perform a concert. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Amy and her family were going to Mount Rushmore. Which event could cause Although she was annoyed by the drive she was impressed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She decided to take the longer route because it was more scenic. (B) Amy's parents were annoying.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) She decided to take the longer route because it was more scenic.\nExplanation: If Amy decided to take the longer route because it was more scenic, she may have been annoyed by the longer drive but impressed by the beautiful views along the way. This event could cause her to have mixed feelings about the trip, but ultimately be impressed by the destination. On the other hand, if Amy's parents were annoying, it would not necessarily lead to her being impressed by Mount Rushmore."}}
{"Q": "Rita loved being outdoors. Which event could cause She now goes hiking nearly every weekend, rain or shine?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rita got a new pair of all weather boots. (B) She learned to fish in the mountains.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Getting a new pair of all weather boots would make it easier for Rita to hike in any weather condition, which could motivate her to go hiking more often. Learning to fish in the mountains may also be enjoyable for Rita, but it does not necessarily explain why she would start going hiking every weekend."}}
{"Q": "Mike was sitting at his desk. Which event could cause Mike started laughing hysterically?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mikes coworker told him a joke. (B) Mike's friend told him his mother passed away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Mike's coworker told him a joke.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mike started laughing hysterically because his coworker told him a joke, as laughter is a common response to humor. It is unlikely that Mike would start laughing hysterically if his friend told him his mother passed away, as that is a sad and serious event."}}
{"Q": "Today was the first day of school. Which event could cause I had a great time at school?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I made a lot of new cars. (B) I met some really cool new friends.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I met some really cool new friends.\nExplanation: Making a lot of new cars is not a typical or expected event on the first day of school, whereas meeting new friends is a common and positive experience. Making new friends can lead to a sense of belonging and enjoyment in school, making it more likely that someone would have a great time."}}
{"Q": "Tom argued with Ana throughout the night since a random guy called her Which event could cause He told Anna to get out?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tom was upset that Ana might be cheating on him. (B) Ana told Tom she was having a family reunion.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tom was upset that Ana might be cheating on him.\nExplanation: Tom's argument with Ana throughout the night suggests that he was already feeling insecure or suspicious about their relationship. The fact that a random guy called Ana may have triggered his jealousy and led him to accuse her of cheating, ultimately resulting in him telling her to get out. On the other hand, choice B about Ana having a family reunion seems unrelated to the argument and does not provide a clear reason for Tom's behavior."}}
{"Q": "Kay was in art class when it was announced they would be painting. Which event could cause Then she saw the neighbors painting, and was embarrassed by her work?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kay thought her painting looked great. (B) Kay was painting a dog, and thought she was doing a really terrible job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Kay thought her painting looked great, she would not have been embarrassed by her work when she saw her neighbors painting. However, if she was struggling with painting a dog and thought she was doing a terrible job, seeing her neighbors' work could have made her feel even more self-conscious and embarrassed about her own painting."}}
{"Q": "Bart is five and he loves trucks. Which event could cause This mythic item is the amazing dump truck that he plays with?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Bart calls his favorite truck the mythic item. (B) Bart thinks his toy ball is mythic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Bart's love for trucks is mentioned in the question, and it is stated that he plays with a dump truck that he considers amazing. Therefore, it is more plausible that Bart would refer to his favorite truck as a mythic item rather than a toy ball."}}
{"Q": "It was Martha's last day of school. Which event could cause He signed it and he even wrote down his phone number?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Martha asked her friend to sign her yearbook. (B) A guy she liked asked her to sign his yearbook.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Martha asked her friend to sign her yearbook.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Martha asked her friend to sign her yearbook and the friend wrote down their phone number as a way to keep in touch over the summer. It is less likely that a guy she liked would ask her to sign his yearbook and then write down his phone number, as this would be an unusual way to express interest in someone."}}
{"Q": "A man drove while listening to the radio. Which event could cause The man called the radio station to ask?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The man heard a song he liked but the radio station mentioned the name of what the song was. (B) He wanted to know the name of a song.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the man wanted to know the name of a song he heard on the radio rather than calling the radio station just because he liked a song but didn't know the name."}}
{"Q": "I was invited to go to a family reunion by my mother. Which event could cause It turned out that I used the wrong address, and had to turn around?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When I got there, I was surprised that I didn't know anyone there. (B) Ideas nextbdoor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. When I got there, I was surprised that I didn't know anyone there.\nExplanation: If the wrong address was used, it is possible that the person ended up at a different location where they didn't know anyone. This scenario is more plausible than the idea of the event being next door, as it is unlikely that the person would have been invited to a family reunion next door without knowing about it beforehand."}}
{"Q": "Rachel had to go to the dentist today. Which event could cause Before she knew it was time to go home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Thankfully, the appointment was fast and painless. (B) The appointment was long and painful.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Thankfully, the appointment was fast and painless.\nExplanation: If Rachel's appointment was fast and painless, it is more likely that she would not have realized how much time had passed and would be surprised that it was already time to go home. On the other hand, if the appointment was long and painful, she would have been more aware of the time passing and would not be as surprised when it was time to leave."}}
{"Q": "I entered an egg race once. Which event could cause I finished third in the race?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I did my best to cook the egg. (B) I did not win it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I did not win it.\nExplanation: The question states that the person finished third in the race, which means they did not win but still placed. Option (A) about cooking the egg does not seem relevant to the outcome of the race. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer as it directly relates to the person's placement in the race."}}
{"Q": "Amy was going to a party. Which event could cause Amy was horrified when she looked in a mirror to see her makeup melte?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It was hot outside the party. (B) Amy was dancing and it was warm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It was hot outside the party.\nExplanation: Heat can cause makeup to melt, especially if it is hot and humid outside. Dancing and warmth may also contribute to the melting, but the heat outside is the most likely cause."}}
{"Q": "A monkey watched a crowd of children walk past his cage. Which event could cause The kid threw some of his food over the fence to feed the monkey?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The monkey screeched loudly and scared the kids away. (B) The money screeched loudly and pointed to his tummy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the monkey would screech and point to his tummy in response to being fed, rather than scaring the kids away. Monkeys are known to be opportunistic feeders and would likely respond positively to being given food."}}
{"Q": "My friend went to get a straightening treatment done yesterday. Which event could cause She decided to lay off the treatments?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My friend's hair became dry and brittle. (B) My friend loved the procedure.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If my friend's hair became dry and brittle after the straightening treatment, it is a common side effect of chemical treatments. It could cause her to decide to lay off the treatments to prevent further damage to her hair. On the other hand, if she loved the procedure, it is unlikely that she would decide to stop getting it done."}}
{"Q": "Roy was at a staff meeting that was soon to close. Which event could cause The whole office, including the boss heard the secret?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) There was a rumor that Roy was absent that day. (B) someone on the other end of the conference call forgot to push the mute button and false about plans for job cuts.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If someone on the other end of the conference call forgot to push the mute button and discussed plans for job cuts, it is possible that the whole office, including the boss, could hear the conversation. This is a more plausible scenario than a rumor about Roy's absence causing the whole office to hear a secret."}}
{"Q": "Who doesn't love pizza? Which event could cause The kitten and Sam are now best friends?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sam was walking home with a pizza pie when he found a kitten and shared some cheese with it. (B) Sam was eating all alone at a party one day when he noticed a stray kitten to share his pizza with.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Sam found the kitten while carrying a pizza pie and shared some cheese with it, as it is a common scenario where people share food with animals they come across. On the other hand, it is less likely that Sam noticed a stray kitten at a party where he was eating alone and decided to share his pizza with it."}}
{"Q": "Jeff needed money to buy a car. Which event could cause His mom was happy with his work ethic so she helped pay for the rest?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jeff managed to spend a lot of time. (B) Jeff got two jobs so he could get the money for a car.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Jeff getting two jobs shows that he is willing to work hard and save up for the car, which would make his mom proud of his work ethic and more likely to help him pay for the rest. Spending a lot of time alone may not necessarily demonstrate the same level of dedication and responsibility."}}
{"Q": "Billy wanted to walk with his dog in the pet parade. Which event could cause But Billy's dog turned and headed him in the opposite direction?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He wanted his dog to go sing a song. (B) Bill hoped his rambunctious pup would follow the other dogs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Billy hoped his dog would follow the other dogs in the pet parade, it is more likely that the dog would turn and head in the opposite direction if it got distracted or excited by something else. Asking the dog to sing a song is not a plausible event that would cause the dog to turn and head in the opposite direction."}}
{"Q": "Jane was out for a walk. Which event could cause She took a hot shower and dried her clothes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Suddenly it began to snow. (B) Suddenly it began to warm up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Suddenly it began to warm up.\nExplanation: If it suddenly began to warm up, Jane may have felt hot and sweaty from her walk and decided to take a hot shower to cool down. She may have also washed and dried her clothes if they were damp from sweating. On the other hand, if it suddenly began to snow, Jane would likely have sought shelter and not continued her walk, making it less likely that she would have taken a hot shower and dried her clothes."}}
{"Q": "I bought a used computer. Which event could cause I realized whoever used to own the computer was very creative?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There were a lot of old poems in the documents folder. (B) When I explored the files on it, I found lots of blank pages.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Finding a lot of old poems in the documents folder suggests that the previous owner was interested in creative writing and may have been a poet. Blank pages could have a variety of explanations, such as the previous owner being a writer who was in the process of drafting new work or simply not using the computer for a period of time. However, finding a collection of old poems is a more direct indication of the previous owner's creativity."}}
{"Q": "Willie walked his neighbor's dog often Which event could cause Willie bo longer walks the dog?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Willie got beat up by the neighbors dog one day. (B) Willie's neighbor then got better and was able to walk the dog.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Willie's neighbor got better and was able to walk the dog, it would make sense for Willie to no longer need to walk the dog as often. On the other hand, if Willie got beat up by the neighbor's dog, it would be unlikely for him to continue walking the dog and risking further harm. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ivan put five hundred dollars into the stock market. Which event could cause Ivan lost all of his money?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ivan's stock went up a lot. (B) Ivan didn't understand how stocks work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Ivan didn't understand how stocks work.\nExplanation: If Ivan didn't understand how stocks work, he may make poor investment decisions or panic and sell his stocks at a loss. This could result in him losing all of his money. While it is possible for Ivan's stock to go up a lot, it is unlikely that he would lose all of his money in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Larry never had seen snow in his entire life. Which event could cause He will never leave Florida again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Larry had to shovel five centimeters of snow off the porch. (B) He traveled to Vermont on vacation and was trapped for days by a record snowfall.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He traveled to Vermont on vacation and was trapped for days by a record snowfall.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly relates to Larry's lack of experience with snow. Being trapped for days in a record snowfall could be a traumatic experience for someone who has never seen snow before, and it could make him hesitant to leave Florida again. Shoveling five centimeters of snow off the porch, while potentially annoying, is unlikely to have such a significant impact on Larry's future travel plans."}}
{"Q": "There was a power outage in the neighborhood due to the thunderstorm. Which event could cause They also participated in several activities such as cooking?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Everyone had to do things together. (B) The towns community center canceled their meeting.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: When there is a power outage, people often have to rely on each other for help and support. Cooking together could be one way for neighbors to come together and share resources during a difficult time. The cancellation of a community center meeting is not directly related to the power outage and would not necessarily lead to people cooking together."}}
{"Q": "Yesterday, I needed to buy a belt so I went to the mall. Which event could cause I picked out a great belt and left feeling excellent?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Then is aw a selection of nice belts. (B) There is a selection of fruit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it directly relates to the task at hand, which is buying a belt. Seeing a selection of nice belts would increase the chances of finding a great belt and feeling satisfied with the purchase. Option B, on the other hand, is unrelated to the task and would not have any impact on the outcome of buying a belt."}}
{"Q": "Zach's family were spending thanksgiving together. Which event could cause The rest of his family cleaned the house and had breakfast together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Zach had to leave for work the next day. (B) Zach cooked the turkey.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Zach cooked the turkey.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the rest of the family would clean the house and have breakfast together if Zach was busy cooking the turkey, which is a time-consuming task. If Zach had to leave for work the next day, it wouldn't necessarily require the rest of the family to clean the house and have breakfast together."}}
{"Q": "Lucy and Rick bought a house for a good price. Which event could cause Then they sold the beautifully renovated house for a huge profit?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They renovated the house and flipped it. (B) The house burnt down the day after they bought it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They renovated the house and flipped it.\nExplanation: Option A is the more plausible answer as it suggests that Lucy and Rick put in effort and investment to improve the house, which increased its value and allowed them to sell it for a profit. Option B, on the other hand, is highly unlikely and would result in a loss rather than a profit."}}
{"Q": "Laura had a passion for art. Which event could cause Laura never painted again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Laura was successful with her drawings. (B) Laura's art teacher was a mean person.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Laura's art teacher was a mean person.\nExplanation: If Laura's art teacher was a mean person, it could have caused her to lose confidence in her abilities and feel discouraged about pursuing her passion for art. This negative experience could have led her to give up on painting altogether. On the other hand, if Laura was successful with her drawings, it would have likely motivated her to continue pursuing her passion for art."}}
{"Q": "The monster banged on the wall. Which event could cause With a final loud thump, her father hung the wall clock?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) It stopped banging and when she turned to look, it was her father silently hanging something. (B) The monster's father told her to stop doing that.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it provides a logical sequence of events. The monster was banging on the wall, and then suddenly there was a final loud thump, which could have been the sound of the father hanging the wall clock. The daughter turned to look, and it was her father silently hanging something, which could have been the wall clock. Option B does not provide a clear connection between the monster banging on the wall and the father hanging the clock."}}
{"Q": "Connie loves making crafts for the holidays. Which event could cause She is much more cautious while using the scissors now?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) While making a paper snowman, she cut herself with scissors and had to be rushed to the hospital. (B) Connie was busy cutting fabric. Connie didn't notice she cut right through all the fabric.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Cutting oneself with scissors and having to be rushed to the hospital is a more serious and traumatic event than simply cutting through fabric. It would make sense for Connie to be more cautious with scissors after experiencing such an incident."}}
{"Q": "I had a date to play chess online with my friend Mick. Which event could cause We never got to play?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) we ended up talking all night. (B) I ended up vomiting all night.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the two friends ended up talking all night and forgot about their chess game, rather than one of them getting sick and unable to play. Additionally, vomiting all night would likely result in canceling plans altogether, rather than just postponing a game of chess."}}
{"Q": "My friend has two cats, and they're not very alike. Which event could cause Over time, even mean cats can warm up to people?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The mean cat started to attack humans for no reason. (B) Recently, one that always hissed at me came near me.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Recently, one that always hissed at me came near me.\nExplanation: This event suggests that the cat is becoming more comfortable around humans and may be warming up to them. If the cat was still mean and aggressive towards humans, it would not have come near the person who it previously hissed at. This gradual change in behavior is a common occurrence in cats and can happen over time with patience and positive reinforcement. On the other hand, if the cat started to attack humans for no reason, it would indicate a more serious issue and would require professional help to address."}}
{"Q": "I've never wanted kids. Which event could cause After watching her, it changed my outlook on wanting kids?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) But the condom broke. (B) My sister recently had a child, and she was close to the child in the months following her birth.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Seeing a family member or close friend have a child and witnessing the bond between parent and child can often change someone's outlook on wanting kids. It is a more plausible scenario than a condom breaking, which may not necessarily lead to a change in desire for children."}}
{"Q": "Sally's two dogs love to ride in in her car. Which event could cause Once the errands were done, the dogs were not happy to go back home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sally took the dogs with her when she had to run errands. (B) Sally took her drugs on errands.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Sally took the dogs with her on errands, they would have enjoyed the car ride and may not have wanted to go back home once the ride was over. However, if Sally did not take the dogs with her on errands, they would not have been expecting a car ride and would not have been disappointed to go back home. Option B is not a plausible answer as it is unrelated to the dogs' behavior."}}
{"Q": "Skip liked to eat candy. Which event could cause He didn't eat candy for a week?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Skip ate apples and threw up. (B) Skip got a toothache.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Skip got a toothache.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Skip didn't eat candy for a week because he got a toothache. Toothaches can make it difficult and painful to eat sugary foods like candy. On the other hand, while eating too many apples could potentially cause Skip to feel sick, it is less likely to completely deter him from eating candy for a whole week."}}
{"Q": "Ruth was playing video games. Which event could cause She won the game easily?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ruth started playing a new game. (B) Ruth challenged her friend to a game of golf.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Ruth started playing a new game.\nExplanation: If Ruth started playing a new game, it is possible that the game is easier than the ones she has played before, or she may have a natural talent for the game. This could lead to her winning the game easily. On the other hand, playing golf with a friend has nothing to do with video games, so it is unlikely to be the cause of Ruth winning a video game easily."}}
{"Q": "The radio DJ got into a big country music binge. Which event could cause The crowd had none of it and stormed the station?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The DJ wouldn't play any other type of music that was requested. (B) The audience wanted the DJ to return to his home country.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The DJ wouldn't play any other type of music that was requested.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the audience would be upset if the DJ refused to play any other type of music besides country, especially if they were requesting different genres. This could lead to frustration and anger among the listeners, potentially causing them to storm the station. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the audience would demand the DJ to return to his home country solely based on his music preferences."}}
{"Q": "I've always wanted to be able to bike thirty miles at one time. Which event could cause Now I can bike 30 miles?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I rode a little further every day. (B) I decided to run instead.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I rode a little further every day.\nExplanation: In order to achieve the goal of biking 30 miles at one time, it would require consistent practice and gradual increase in distance. Option A suggests that the individual gradually increased their biking distance each day, which would lead to them eventually being able to bike 30 miles at one time. Option B, deciding to run instead, would not directly lead to the individual being able to bike 30 miles at one time."}}
{"Q": "The principal of Brandon's school was retiring this year. Which event could cause Everyone clapped for the new guy?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) At a school assembly the new principal was introduced. (B) The school held an assembly to usher out the new principal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. At a school assembly the new principal was introduced.\nExplanation: It is common for people to clap and show appreciation when someone new is introduced, especially in a school setting where the principal plays an important role. On the other hand, it is unlikely that people would clap for someone who is leaving or being ushered out, as it is a more somber occasion. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mike has been looking for extra sources of income this summer. Which event could cause He decided to look for other sources of income?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Mike mowed lawns but did not make very little money at it. (B) Mike did not want to be a fisherman.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Mike mowed lawns but did not make very little money at it, it is plausible that he would look for other sources of income. However, there is no indication that Mike had any interest in being a fisherman, so option B is less likely to be the cause of his search for extra income."}}
{"Q": "Ron started his new job as a landscaper today. Which event could cause His boss commends him for a job well done?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ron followed specifications and took extra gum to get the job done. (B) Ron followed specifications and took extra miles to get job done.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Taking extra gum to get the job done doesn't make sense in this context. However, taking extra care and effort to follow specifications and complete the job well is a plausible reason for Ron's boss to commend him."}}
{"Q": "Sam and Ellie met at adult education classes. Which event could cause And soon they were reading each other books on their dates?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They both liked movies and hit it off immediately. (B) Sam and Ellie both liked to read books.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sam and Ellie both liked to read books.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to the activity they started doing together. If they both enjoyed reading books, it makes sense that they would share their favorite books with each other on their dates. Choice (A) about liking movies doesn't necessarily lead to the activity of reading books together."}}
{"Q": "Tracy's cat was named Bob. Which event could cause Bob still has fleas?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tracy used an expensive vet treatment on her cat. (B) Tracy would never give her cat, Bob a bath.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tracy would never give her cat, Bob a bath.\nExplanation: If Tracy never gives her cat, Bob a bath, then he may still have fleas. Fleas can be difficult to get rid of and require regular grooming and treatment. If Bob is not being bathed or groomed regularly, the fleas may continue to thrive on him. Using an expensive vet treatment may help to eliminate the fleas, but if Bob is not being properly cared for, he may become reinfested."}}
{"Q": "Luca was baptized in the Catholic church. Which event could cause Luca flew to Syria to join Isis?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Luca began talking to an Irish man on the internet and fell in love with him. (B) Luca hated the Church.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Luca's hatred towards the Catholic Church could lead him to join a radical group like Isis, rather than falling in love with someone on the internet. Baptism in the Catholic Church does not necessarily determine one's beliefs and actions in the future."}}
{"Q": "Ray's teacher told the class to be quiet as she passed out tests. Which event could cause Ray felt helpless?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ray scanned the test and didn't know the answers. (B) Ray's teacher had to go to the bathroom but was afraid to ask.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Ray feeling helpless would most likely be caused by not knowing the answers on the test, as this is a situation where he may feel like he has no control over the outcome. In contrast, the teacher needing to use the bathroom would not necessarily cause Ray to feel helpless, as it is a situation that is out of his control but does not directly affect his performance on the test."}}
{"Q": "I've set a goal to lose thirty pounds by the end of June. Which event could cause When I finished, I was exhausted but I felt wonderful?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) During the first day I worked out for three hours straight in order to jump start my diet. (B) I finished a rigorous workout program.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer because it directly relates to the goal of losing thirty pounds by the end of June. Finishing a rigorous workout program would indicate that the person has been consistently working towards their weight loss goal and has likely made progress. Additionally, the feeling of exhaustion followed by a sense of accomplishment aligns with the experience of completing a challenging workout program. Option A, on the other hand, seems extreme and potentially dangerous, as working out for three hours straight could lead to injury or burnout."}}
{"Q": "Megan had recently put up her Christmas tree. Which event could cause Unfortunately it was too tall combined with the tree and wouldn't fit?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Megan tried to put the tree topper on the floor next to her tree. (B) Megan placed the star at tree top.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Megan placed the star at the top of the tree and it was too tall, then it wouldn't fit in the room. This is a more plausible answer than A because it is unlikely that Megan would try to put the tree topper on the floor next to the tree, as that would not be a typical way to decorate a Christmas tree."}}
{"Q": "Maggie noticed a bat was flying around her ceiling. Which event could cause Maggie's cat was dead?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Maggie wondered why her cat did not catch the bat. (B) The cat scratched and killed the bat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The cat scratched and killed the bat.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the cat was able to catch and kill the bat, rather than the bat causing the death of the cat. Therefore, option (B) is the more likely event that could have caused the death of Maggie's cat."}}
{"Q": "As a child I often went too my grandma's house. Which event could cause Her home is now a place I take my children?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She always treated me poorly and I hated going to her house. (B) She always treated me kindly and I loved going to her house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She always treated me kindly and I loved going to her house.\nExplanation: It is more likely that positive experiences at the grandmother's house would lead to the desire to bring one's own children there. If the grandmother had treated the child poorly, it is unlikely that the child would have fond memories of the house and want to return as an adult with their own children."}}
{"Q": "Phineas and his son were stuck in the ditch. Which event could cause After an hour someone came by and helped them get out?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Phineas and his son thought no one would come. (B) Phineas and his son had passed away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Phineas and his son thought no one would come.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Phineas and his son were stuck in the ditch for an hour and thought no one would come to help them, rather than them passing away in the ditch within an hour. The fact that someone eventually came to help them suggests that they were still alive and waiting for assistance."}}
{"Q": "Sammy always claimed to make the perfect pancake. Which event could cause He was the clear winner?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He judged a pancake making contest. (B) Sammy entered into a competition after working hours on it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He judged a pancake making contest.\nExplanation: If Sammy judged a pancake making contest, it would give him the opportunity to taste and evaluate other people's pancakes. If his pancake truly was the best, he would be able to recognize it and declare himself the winner. This scenario also allows for the possibility of unbiased judging, as Sammy would not be competing himself. Option B suggests that Sammy entered a competition, which would not necessarily guarantee that he would win, even if he believed his pancake was perfect."}}
{"Q": "Julie bought a cat today. Which event could cause Julie is excited to have Lily in her life?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) SHE ABANDONED IT. (B) The cat cuddled with Julie.", "R": {"text": "Answer: The cat cuddled with Julie.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Julie would be excited to have Lily in her life if the cat showed affection towards her by cuddling. Abandoning a pet would not typically lead to excitement or happiness."}}
{"Q": "Victor idolized mike tyson. Which event could cause He got a lot of attention and fame?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He met Mike Tyson one day at the mall. His friends knew that he had met him. (B) Mike Tyson is a former soccer player.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Meeting Mike Tyson, who is a famous boxer, would be a significant event for someone who idolizes him. The fact that Victor's friends knew about it would also add to the attention and fame he received. On the other hand, Mike Tyson being a former soccer player is not a plausible answer as he is known for his career in boxing."}}
{"Q": "Janice and Alma were two friends who went out to eat one day. Which event could cause Eventually, the guy went and sat with them and they all ate together?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Alma noticed a guy looking at Janice. (B) They wanted to eat alone, so Janice and Alma pretended they didn't see their other friend.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it sets up a scenario where a guy is interested in Janice, which could lead to him approaching them and eventually joining them for a meal. Option B does not provide any logical reason for their friend to suddenly join them for a meal."}}
{"Q": "We went to the mall to buy christmas presents. Which event could cause We just let them have it and tried to find a new spot at the mall?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We tried to park in a space someone was waiting for. (B) There was 1 toy left and another person hated it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If we tried to park in a space someone was waiting for, it could cause a confrontation or argument, leading us to give up the spot and find a new one. This scenario is more plausible than the second option, as it is common for people to get frustrated over parking spaces during busy shopping seasons."}}
{"Q": "My girlfriend and I messed up the bed pretty bad. Which event could cause We finished by placing the pillows decoratively?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We decided to make the bed and straighten the blankets. (B) We decided to clean the bed after work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the bed was messed up pretty bad, it is more likely that the couple would decide to make the bed and straighten the blankets rather than just clean it after work. Additionally, the fact that they placed the pillows decoratively suggests that they were trying to make the bed look nice and presentable, which is more in line with the intention of making the bed rather than just cleaning it."}}
{"Q": "Gina's mom was going to her younger brothers house. Which event could cause If her siblings were going to have fun, so was she?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The kids loved playing with Ginas mom. (B) Gina wanted to go to her brother's house too.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gina would want to go to her brother's house to have fun with her siblings rather than the kids loving to play with her mom. It is natural for siblings to want to spend time together and have fun, so it makes sense that Gina would want to join in on the fun."}}
{"Q": "A man was having a panic attack. Which event could cause He never had a panic attack again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A fairy came down and stopped the mans panic attack. (B) He decided to go see a doctor and get therapy for his anxiety but it failed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B.\nExplanation: Seeking professional help and therapy for anxiety is a common and effective way to manage panic attacks. While the fairy scenario is unlikely and unrealistic, seeking medical treatment is a practical solution that could potentially prevent future panic attacks."}}
{"Q": "Danny loved baking doughnuts for his friends and family. Which event could cause Danny's shop became one of the most popular places in town?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He opened up a aquarium shop. (B) Danny decided to open up his own doughnut shop.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Danny opened up his own doughnut shop, it is likely that he would be able to showcase his baking skills and offer a variety of doughnuts to customers. As word spreads about the delicious treats, more people would come to the shop, making it one of the most popular places in town. On the other hand, opening up an aquarium shop would not have any relation to Danny's passion for baking and would not likely attract the same level of attention or popularity."}}
{"Q": "Jenny was a photographer. Which event could cause After they were done, the couple promised to leave a positive review?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jenny forgot her camera to take photographs. (B) She took photos for free of a poor couple.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She took photos for free of a poor couple.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the couple would leave a positive review if Jenny took photos for free for a poor couple, as this act of kindness would likely leave a lasting impression on the couple. Forgetting her camera would not be a positive experience for the couple and would not likely result in a positive review."}}
{"Q": "Kayla wanted to look her best for her date. Which event could cause Her date complimented her and said she looked great?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kayla went to the hair salon and got a new hairdo and her makeup done. (B) Kayla took libterties with her clothes and makeup.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Going to the hair salon and getting a new hairdo and makeup done is a more plausible answer as it involves a significant change in Kayla's appearance and shows that she put effort into her appearance for the date. Taking liberties with her clothes and makeup could mean anything and may not necessarily result in a noticeable change in her appearance."}}
{"Q": "Marty loved taking pictures. Which event could cause Marty's photoset was featured in the newspaper?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Marty lost his camera one day. (B) He shot and printed a thoughtful series on the progress of the seasons.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He shot and printed a thoughtful series on the progress of the seasons.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it shows that Marty has a talent for photography and has put effort into creating a series of photos that are worth featuring in the newspaper. Losing his camera (option A) does not necessarily showcase his photography skills, and it is unlikely that the newspaper would feature a random set of photos without any context or story behind them. On the other hand, a series of photos that capture the beauty and changes of the seasons would be a great addition to a newspaper's lifestyle or arts section."}}
{"Q": "Gina was at the grocery store near her home. Which event could cause Gina let out a big sigh, knowing this was going to be a long wait?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina was the only person in line. (B) Gina went during peak time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Gina went during peak time.\nExplanation: If Gina went during peak time, there would likely be a long line and wait time at the grocery store. This is a common experience for many people, and it would be understandable for Gina to let out a big sigh knowing she would have to wait in a long line. On the other hand, if Gina was the only person in line, there would be no reason for her to let out a big sigh as she would likely be served quickly."}}
{"Q": "Francis noticed that he had a toothache. Which event could cause He was happy when the dentist fixed his toothache?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Francis made an appointment and went to the doctor to get the tooth looked at. (B) Francis lost a tooth at the dentist's.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Francis had a toothache, it is likely that he would make an appointment with a dentist to get it looked at. The dentist would then be able to fix the toothache, which would make Francis happy. Losing a tooth at the dentist's would not necessarily fix a toothache and is not a likely scenario for causing happiness in this situation."}}
{"Q": "Garry was nervous about his grades. Which event could cause Garry and his coach agreed that Nike makes good sneakers?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Garry's coach rewarded him for his good grades with new shoes. (B) Despite his misgivings Garry became valedictorian & Adidas picked him up as a sponsor providing years of footwear.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Garry's nervousness about his grades is unrelated to his potential sponsorship by Adidas. Option A is more plausible as it suggests that Garry's coach rewarded him for his good grades with new shoes, which could have been Nike sneakers. This event could have led to Garry and his coach agreeing that Nike makes good sneakers."}}
{"Q": "David was having trouble sleeping at night. Which event could cause The next night, he took too many of them, and never woke up again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) David refused to take sleeping pills. (B) He decided he'd take some sleeping pills.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He decided he'd take some sleeping pills.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that David took action to try and solve his sleeping problem by taking sleeping pills. However, he may have taken too many, which could have led to an overdose and ultimately his death. On the other hand, option (A) suggests that David refused to take sleeping pills, which would not have caused his death."}}
{"Q": "Betty loved presents. Which event could cause That she should give a little to get a little?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She often gives presents back. (B) She bought shoes for all.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She often gives presents back.\nExplanation: If Betty often gives presents back, it suggests that she values the act of giving and receiving gifts equally. This would make it more likely that she would be willing to give a little in order to receive a little in return. On the other hand, buying shoes for all may indicate that Betty is generous, but it doesn't necessarily suggest that she would be willing to give in order to receive."}}
{"Q": "Dan was making dinner for his family Which event could cause The salad was ready to eat?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) he chopped up a lot of vegetables while cooking. (B) Dan hadn't purchased anything for salad.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) he chopped up a lot of vegetables while cooking.\nExplanation: If Dan chopped up a lot of vegetables while cooking, it is likely that he used them to make a salad. Therefore, it is plausible that the salad was ready to eat. On the other hand, if Dan hadn't purchased anything for salad (option B), it is unlikely that the salad would be ready to eat."}}
{"Q": "A scientist discovers that there is a disease beginning to spread. Which event could cause They feel foolish for having done so?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The scientist warns everyone then realizes he was wrong. (B) They accidentally contamined themselves with the spread.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the scientist warns everyone and then realizes they were wrong, they may feel foolish for causing unnecessary panic and potentially wasting resources. However, if they accidentally contaminated themselves with the disease, they may feel regret or frustration, but it is less likely that they would feel foolish for something that was out of their control."}}
{"Q": "It was Amy's first day in the first grade. Which event could cause Amy felt like a big kid for the first time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy walked to school with her parents. (B) Amy walked to school with her little sister.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Amy walked to school with her little sister.\nExplanation: Walking to school with her little sister could make Amy feel like a big kid for the first time because she is taking on the responsibility of being a role model and taking care of her younger sibling. This could give her a sense of maturity and independence, which are important qualities of being a \"big kid.\" Walking with her parents may not have the same effect as they are expected to take care of their children."}}
{"Q": "Sue was excited to plant her first garden. Which event could cause The seed packets no longer marked the rows but lay all over the yard?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She spent hours getting it perfect. (B) Sue left seeds outside in a storm.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Sue leaving the seeds outside in a storm is a more plausible event that could cause the seed packets to no longer be marked and scattered all over the yard. A storm could easily blow the packets away or mix them up, whereas spending hours getting the garden perfect would not necessarily lead to the packets being scattered."}}
{"Q": "Billy wanted to become a doctor. Which event could cause He never regretted his decision?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Billy studied hard and became a doctor. (B) Billy's father finally became a doctor and worked very hard everyday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Billy studied hard and became a doctor.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Billy's own efforts and determination to achieve his goal of becoming a doctor. It shows that he worked hard and succeeded in his dream, which would likely lead to him feeling fulfilled and not regretting his decision. On the other hand, option B is not directly related to Billy's own actions and may not have as strong of an impact on his personal satisfaction with his career choice."}}
{"Q": "Amy decided to move from Wisconsin to Florida. Which event could cause However, she discovered Alaska was a lot of fun?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Amy did not think Alaska would be and decided not to take a trip there before the move. (B) Amy did not think Alaska would be fun but decided to take a trip there before the move.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Amy did not think Alaska would be fun, it is unlikely that she would suddenly change her mind without experiencing it firsthand. Therefore, it is more plausible that she decided to take a trip there before the move and discovered that it was a lot of fun."}}
{"Q": "Nell loved to walk in the field behind her house. Which event could cause She turned around to see her house far in the distance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She walked way too far and got lost. (B) She walked way too far and got thirsty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She walked way too far and got lost.\nExplanation: If Nell walked too far and got lost, she may have continued walking in an attempt to find her way back. As she walked further away from her house, it would appear smaller and farther in the distance. On the other hand, getting thirsty would not necessarily cause her to turn around and look at her house in the distance."}}
{"Q": "Larry was using his wife's laptop Which event could cause Larry confronted her about it and they're filing for divorce?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Larry saw a pop-up ad from her favorite website. (B) While on the laptop, an email popped up from another man, her secret lover.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: While seeing a pop-up ad from her favorite website may be annoying, it is unlikely to cause a divorce. However, discovering an email from another man, her secret lover, would be a much more serious and potentially relationship-ending event."}}
{"Q": "The researcher observed the tiger from behind a bush. Which event could cause The researcher was so excited to experience such a sight?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They find the tiger. (B) The tiger was eating a cub.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. They find the tiger.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the researcher would be excited to see a tiger in its natural habitat rather than witnessing a gruesome event like a tiger eating a cub. Therefore, finding the tiger would be a more likely cause for the researcher's excitement."}}
{"Q": "I was really nervous before my first middle school dance. Which event could cause I drove her to iHop for pancakes and shakes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My date wanted to get something to eat before the dance. (B) My date wanted to get something to eat before the dance, but we were late.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for going to iHop was simply because the date wanted to get something to eat before the dance. Option B suggests that they were already running late, which would make it unlikely that they would stop for food."}}
{"Q": "Amy and her friends were watching a movie at Lynn's house. Which event could cause The embarrassed man changed the channel, and left quietly?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The girls quietly turned the TV to some porn not realizing her Father just came home. (B) Amy saw a sex scene in the movie.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Option A is a more plausible answer as it involves a situation where the man could have been embarrassed and changed the channel. Option B only mentions Amy seeing a sex scene in the movie, but it doesn't explain why the man would be embarrassed and leave quietly. Option A, on the other hand, involves the man being embarrassed by the girls accidentally turning the TV to porn and him leaving quietly as a result."}}
{"Q": "My family was on vacation in Italy. Which event could cause Munich looked good in the picture's background?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We also visited Munich and took photos. (B) We also visited Paris and took photos.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) We also visited Munich and took photos.\nExplanation: If the family visited Munich and took photos, it is likely that one of the photos had Munich in the background. It is less likely that a photo taken in Paris would have Munich in the background. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Garry was nervous about his grades. Which event could cause If Garry doesn't improve his grades, he will be off the team?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gary spent all his time playing football & not studying. (B) Garry's coach said his grades were good and he could stay on the team.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Garry spends all his time playing football and not studying, it is likely that his grades will suffer and he may not meet the academic requirements to stay on the team. This is a more plausible event than Garry's coach saying his grades are good and he can stay on the team, as the statement contradicts the initial premise that Garry was nervous about his grades."}}
{"Q": "Lisa wanted to see her favorite band's concert. Which event could cause Lisa went to the concert with her friends and had fun?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lisa went online, but tickets were sold out. (B) Lisa also invited her friends to the concert.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Lisa also invited her friends to the concert.\nExplanation: If Lisa invited her friends to the concert, it is more likely that she went to the concert with them and had fun. Additionally, if tickets were sold out, it would be less likely that Lisa would have been able to attend the concert at all."}}
{"Q": "Barry loved to scavenge for young saplings in the forest. Which event could cause They bought every last one of Barry's baskets?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Barry made baskets, and sold them at an event. (B) Barry used the saplings to make figurines to sell to people at the weekend market.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Barry loved to scavenge for young saplings in the forest, but it does not mention anything about him using them to make figurines. On the other hand, it is more plausible that Barry made baskets from the saplings and sold them at an event, which could have led to someone buying all of his baskets."}}
{"Q": "Terry was walking through the city park Which event could cause Terry soon studied chess and began playing himself?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terry noticed people playing chess in the part. (B) Terry saw people playing golf and was fascinated by the game.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Terry noticed people playing chess in the park.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Terry became interested in chess after seeing people playing it in the park, rather than being fascinated by golf. Seeing others play a game can spark curiosity and interest in trying it out oneself."}}
{"Q": "Sadie was on a huge hike. Which event could cause Luckily she pushed herself and managed to reach the peak?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sadie almost gave down mid way. (B) Sadie wanted to go to the top.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Sadie almost gave up mid way, it means she was facing some difficulties or challenges during the hike. However, the fact that she pushed herself and managed to reach the peak suggests that she overcame those challenges and persevered despite the difficulties. On the other hand, (B) simply states that Sadie wanted to go to the top, which doesn't necessarily explain why she was able to reach the peak despite the challenges she faced."}}
{"Q": "April was not feeling well when she woke up. Which event could cause The medicine worked and she went back to school the next day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) April went to the Dr. and got some disease. (B) April took night time medicine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If April took night time medicine, it is possible that it helped her feel better and she was able to go back to school the next day. Going to the doctor and getting a disease would likely take more than one day to recover from."}}
{"Q": "Jane was at a grocery store. Which event could cause And only bought almond milk from then on?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jane found out that almond milk was better for you. (B) Jane spilled almond milk while at the store.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jane found out that almond milk was better for her health or dietary needs, rather than spilling it and deciding to only buy almond milk from then on. Spilling a product does not necessarily lead to a change in purchasing habits, whereas learning new information about a product's benefits could."}}
{"Q": "Marcus wanted to join his high school football team. Which event could cause At the end of tryouts he made the team and was very proud?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Marcus went to try out day and tried out. (B) Marcus practiced hockey really hard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: The event that led to Marcus making the football team was attending tryouts and performing well enough to be selected for the team. Practicing hockey would not necessarily have any impact on his ability to make the football team."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy's dad took him to see his favorite baseball team. Which event could cause Leaping up, Jimmy was thrilled to successfully catch the ball?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jimmy saw a homerun ball headed toward him. (B) Jimmy threw the ball near his dad.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jimmy saw a homerun ball headed toward him.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jimmy would leap up and be thrilled to catch a homerun ball, as it is a rare and exciting event in a baseball game. Throwing the ball near his dad would not likely cause such a strong reaction from Jimmy."}}
{"Q": "Stan's toddler flushed something down the toilet. Which event could cause Then he retrieved Stan's son's toy from the pipes?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A plumber arrived and turned off the water. (B) He realized that it was his son's toy and clogged up the pipes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Stan realized it was his son's toy and attempted to retrieve it from the pipes himself, rather than waiting for a plumber to arrive and turn off the water. Plumbers typically do not turn off the water to retrieve small objects from pipes, and it would be more efficient for Stan to handle the situation himself."}}
{"Q": "While I was in college, I had met an older man. Which event could cause I have negative memories of that time?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was very creepy, and I was glad to cut him out of my life. (B) The younger man became mean to me and I had to leave.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the older man was very creepy, it is likely that the individual would have negative memories of that time. This could include feeling uncomfortable or unsafe around the older man, and ultimately deciding to cut him out of their life. On the other hand, if the younger man became mean, it may have been a negative experience, but it would not necessarily be directly related to the older man and their initial meeting."}}
{"Q": "I've always wanted a dog, but my mom thinks I'm irresponsible. Which event could cause On my birthday, I got a golden retriever puppy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I showed her I wasn't responsible. (B) My mom surprised me with exactly what I wanted.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) My mom surprised me with exactly what I wanted.\nExplanation: If the mother surprised the child with a golden retriever puppy on their birthday, it would indicate that the mother had changed her mind about the child's responsibility and decided to give them a chance to prove themselves. It would also show that the mother was willing to compromise and make her child happy on their special day."}}
{"Q": "Jan's parents won't stop pestering her about being single. Which event could cause Her parents buy the act and leave happy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) jans parents stop talking about it. (B) Jan tells her parents shes married.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Jan introduces her parents to a potential partner.\nExplanation: Jan's parents seem to be fixated on her relationship status, so introducing them to a potential partner could satisfy their desire for her to be in a relationship. This could also show them that Jan is actively trying to find someone and may ease their concerns about her being single. Option A is not a plausible answer as it does not address the root of the problem, and option B is not a viable solution as lying to her parents about being married could cause more problems in the long run."}}
{"Q": "Sherry and her oldest daughter don't often see things eye to eye. Which event could cause It's hard to image two people who are more different?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sherry and her son don't look alike, but they think alike. (B) Sherry and her oldest daughter are frequently disagreeing on many subjects.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Sherry and her oldest daughter don't often see things eye to eye, which implies that they frequently disagree on many subjects. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer as it directly relates to the given statement. Option A talks about Sherry and her son, which is not relevant to the given statement."}}
{"Q": "John blinked his eyes and read the sign again. Which event could cause The prankster who had hacked the sign enjoyed the chaos he had caused?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The sign he created was totally changed from his creation. (B) Someone had left the sign as stop instead of yield.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer because it suggests that someone had made a mistake while operating the sign, which could have caused confusion and chaos. On the other hand, option A suggests that the sign was completely changed from its original message, which seems less likely to happen without anyone noticing. Therefore, option B is a more logical explanation for the chaos caused by the prankster's hack."}}
{"Q": "I came out of my class and walked to my locker. Which event could cause She took me to the school's nurse?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I hurt my hand and the teacher found me. (B) Sarah accidentally bumped into me and fell pretty hard.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If I hurt my hand and the teacher found me, it is possible that the teacher would send me to the nurse for treatment. However, if Sarah accidentally bumped into me and fell pretty hard, it is unlikely that I would need to see the nurse unless I was also injured in the fall."}}
{"Q": "Crissy wanted to see the new movie coming out. Which event could cause Crissy never sees the movie?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She was able to find parking as the theater was empty. (B) Crissy forgot about it after the commercials stopped.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Crissy forgot about it after the commercials stopped.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because forgetting about the movie is a common human error, whereas finding parking in an empty theater is unlikely to prevent someone from seeing a movie. Additionally, the fact that Crissy forgot about the movie suggests that it wasn't a high priority for her, which could easily lead to her never seeing it."}}
{"Q": "Last week I went rappelling with my friends. Which event could cause However thankfully i repelled safely?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) we had an accident. (B) It was very slippery and low.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) we had an accident.\nExplanation: This is a plausible answer as rappelling can be a dangerous activity and accidents can happen if proper safety measures are not taken. However, the fact that the person repelled safely suggests that they were able to avoid any accidents or injuries. Option (B) is less likely as slippery conditions and low heights would not necessarily result in a dangerous situation if proper precautions are taken."}}
{"Q": "Lisa got a new toothbrush. Which event could cause Lisa always bought soft toothbrushes from then on?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It was the first soft bristle tooth brush Lisa ever bought. (B) Lisa used the toothbrush and it was too short and scraped her gums.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Lisa used the toothbrush and it was too short and scraped her gums, it would be a negative experience that would likely cause her to switch to a softer toothbrush in the future. This is a more plausible answer than (A), which doesn't necessarily indicate a negative experience with the toothbrush."}}
{"Q": "Nate came out of the doctor's office. Which event could cause Nate immediately got up and cleaned himself?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nate saw the doctor trip and fall on a patch of grass. (B) Nate fell and got dirty.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Nate fell and got dirty, it would be more plausible for him to immediately get up and clean himself. Seeing the doctor trip and fall on a patch of grass would not necessarily cause Nate to feel the need to clean himself."}}
{"Q": "We had cats in our workplace. Which event could cause She got sick and went home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) One of the employees is allergic to peanuts. (B) Karen didn't know she was allergic to the cats.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Karen didn't know she was allergic to the cats, as exposure to allergens can cause sickness and allergic reactions. On the other hand, an employee being allergic to peanuts would not necessarily cause Karen to get sick and go home."}}
{"Q": "Little Timmy loved making home movies. Which event could cause His parents were worried after they read his new script?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Timmy wrote a horrible script. (B) Timmy wrote a wonderful script.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Timmy wrote a horrible script.\nExplanation: If Timmy wrote a wonderful script, his parents would likely be proud and supportive of his creativity. However, if Timmy wrote a horrible script, his parents may be worried about the content or themes he is exploring in his movies. They may also be concerned about the influence of outside sources on his writing. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Matthew is not allowed to eat or drink near the computer. Which event could cause Matthew looses computer privileges for a month?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Matthew had a cup of water at the computer. (B) Matthew had an empty cup at the computer.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Since Matthew is not allowed to eat or drink near the computer, having a cup of water at the computer would be a violation of the rule. Having an empty cup at the computer may not necessarily indicate that Matthew was drinking near the computer, so it is less likely to result in a punishment of losing computer privileges for a month."}}
{"Q": "I was inside of a comic shop. Which event could cause I went home and read it, and really liked it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I found a Spiderman I'd never seen. (B) I bought a tragedian.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I found a Spiderman I'd never seen.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that someone would be excited to read a comic they had never seen before, especially if it is a popular character like Spiderman. Buying a tragedian (which is not a common comic book genre) is less likely to result in someone enjoying it enough to go home and read it."}}
{"Q": "A Senator opposed a bill. Which event could cause It passed, ninety-nine to one?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They were know for being right. (B) He was in a minority on this bill.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He was in a minority on this bill.\nExplanation: If the Senator was in a minority on this bill, it means that the majority of the other Senators supported the bill. Therefore, even if the Senator opposed it, the bill could still pass with a vote of 99 to 1. This is a more plausible answer than (A) because being known for being right does not necessarily guarantee that others will agree with the Senator's position on a particular bill."}}
{"Q": "Lucy had a test tomorrow at school and she barely studied. Which event could cause Lucy failed the test because she had not studied?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lucy stayed up all night studying for the test. (B) Lucy chose not to study.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Lucy barely studied, it is more plausible that she failed the test because she chose not to study rather than staying up all night studying. Lack of preparation and effort is more likely to result in poor performance than cramming the night before."}}
{"Q": "Linda went to buy some frozen yogurt. Which event could cause Linda was very disappointed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They didn't have her favorite flavor there. (B) The store in Linda's neighborhood was closed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) They didn't have her favorite flavor there.\nExplanation: Linda went to buy frozen yogurt, which implies that she had a specific craving for it. If the store didn't have her favorite flavor, it would be a disappointment for her as she wouldn't be able to satisfy her craving. On the other hand, if the store in her neighborhood was closed, she could simply go to another store or come back later when it's open. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Timmy was told many times not to play ball in the house. Which event could cause Since no one would admit it, the family vacation was cancelled?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Timmy broke the mirror but wouldn't admit it. (B) Timmy still played and broke a nail.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Timmy breaking the mirror and not admitting it is a more plausible event that could cause the family vacation to be cancelled. Playing ball in the house could easily lead to a broken mirror, and if Timmy refused to take responsibility for it, the family may have felt it was necessary to cancel the vacation as a consequence. Breaking a nail, while potentially painful, is not a significant enough event to warrant cancelling a family vacation."}}
{"Q": "Terry had a birthday and went to his favorite restaurant. Which event could cause The waiter did not sing so Terry sang to himself?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terry was excited to have happy birthday sang to him. (B) Terry thought that the restaurant staff forget about his birthday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Terry was excited to have happy birthday sang to him, he would not have felt the need to sing to himself. However, if he thought that the restaurant staff forgot about his birthday, he may have taken matters into his own hands and sang to himself to make the occasion feel more special. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Mary-Anne was feeling lonely and decided to adopt a cat. Which event could cause She took the cat home with her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary-Anne found an affectionate and cute cat. (B) She saw a pitiful looking cat at the pet store.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Mary-Anne was feeling lonely and wanted a companion, so it is more plausible that she would choose a cat that is affectionate and cute rather than a pitiful looking cat. Additionally, pet stores often have strict adoption processes and may not allow someone to take a cat home on a whim."}}
{"Q": "I used to work on Mechanical Turk Which event could cause Amazon decided to ban me?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I made too much debt. (B) I made too much money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) I made too much debt.\nExplanation: Amazon Mechanical Turk has strict policies regarding the quality of work and payment. If a worker consistently produces low-quality work or fails to complete tasks on time, requesters may reject their work, resulting in a decrease in their approval rating. This can lead to a decrease in the number of available tasks and, ultimately, a decrease in earnings. If a worker continues to accept tasks despite their low approval rating, they may accumulate debt, which can result in Amazon banning them from the platform. Therefore, it is more plausible that making too much debt would cause Amazon to ban a worker rather than making too much money."}}
{"Q": "Bill had relocated to a new town, and needed to find a gym. Which event could cause After visiting, Bill became a proud member of the gym?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He checked his phone for the closest gym to him. (B) He checked his phone for the closest cafe to him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Bill checked his phone for the closest gym to him, it is likely that he was actively searching for a gym and had an interest in joining one. After visiting the gym, he may have found it to be a good fit for his fitness goals and decided to become a member. Checking his phone for the closest cafe would not necessarily lead to him becoming a member of a gym."}}
{"Q": "I left work grumpy because it was a long day. Which event could cause A nice lady helped me up and called an ambulance?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I was tired and fell down. (B) When walking home, I stepped over a rock on the ground.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it involves a potential accident or injury that would require the assistance of a nice lady and an ambulance. Option B, on the other hand, is a common occurrence and would not necessarily warrant such a response."}}
{"Q": "Kate went into labor on Monday morning. Which event could cause The doctor delivered Kate's baby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her water broke and she was in pain on the way to the hospital. (B) Kate told the nurse to get a midwife.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Kate's water broke and she was in pain, it is likely that she was in active labor and needed medical attention. The doctor would be called to deliver the baby in this situation. In choice (B), Kate asking for a midwife does not necessarily mean that a doctor would not be present, and midwives may not have the necessary medical training to deliver a baby in all situations."}}
{"Q": "My back was aching from work. Which event could cause My back felt much better afterwards?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I decided to stand up for a bit. (B) I went to see the Chiropactor for an adjustment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: If the back pain was caused by work-related strain or injury, seeing a chiropractor for an adjustment would be a more plausible solution to alleviate the pain. Standing up for a bit may provide temporary relief, but it may not address the underlying issue causing the pain. A chiropractor can provide targeted treatment to the affected area and help realign the spine, which can lead to significant pain relief."}}
{"Q": "Joan's grandma had to go to a nursing home. Which event could cause She packed the jars, dusted them, and put them on a shelf at home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joan's grandma is getting very old and she was doing unwanted things in home. (B) Joan took some jars her grandma couldn't stand anymore.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Joan took some jars her grandma couldn't stand anymore.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it directly relates to the action of packing and dusting the jars. If Joan's grandma was simply getting old and doing unwanted things in the home, it wouldn't make sense for Joan to pack and dust jars as a result. However, if Joan took some jars that her grandma couldn't stand anymore, it would make sense for her to pack and dust them before putting them on a shelf at home."}}
{"Q": "Ned went on vacation in Peru. Which event could cause Ned managed to make it to the top with the porter's assistance?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He had too much luggage to carry at the hotel. (B) Ned's hotel room was on the first floor thankfully as the elevators weren't working.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Ned needed assistance with carrying his luggage, which is a common reason for hiring a porter. Option B does not provide any reason for why Ned would need a porter's assistance to reach the top."}}
{"Q": "The giraffe tried to eat the leaves. Which event could cause The Giraffe ate all the leaves on the tree?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was no longer starving and was finally full. (B) He was starving and was not getting full.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He was no longer starving and was finally full.\nExplanation: If the giraffe had been trying to eat the leaves and was finally full, it is more likely that he would have eaten all the leaves on the tree. If he was starving and not getting full, he would have continued to eat until he was full, but may not have been able to eat all the leaves on the tree."}}
{"Q": "Frank loves to go to this certain deli by his apartment. Which event could cause Now Frank has to find a new place to eat a sandwich?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Frank's favorite deli opened. (B) Frank was sad to learn the deli closed.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Frank's favorite deli closed, he would have to find a new place to eat a sandwich. On the other hand, if his favorite deli opened, he would have no reason to find a new place to eat a sandwich. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tom thought he was an amazing chess player. Which event could cause Tom was both amazed and humbled at his dad?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tom's dad couldn't beat him at chess. (B) Tom played his dad and lost the chess game.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tom played his dad and lost the chess game, it would be a humbling experience for him as he thought he was amazing at chess. It would also amaze him to see his dad's skills and realize that there is still much to learn and improve upon. On the other hand, if Tom's dad couldn't beat him at chess, it would not necessarily be amazing or humbling for Tom as he already thought he was amazing at chess."}}
{"Q": "Elizabeth is a very proper woman. Which event could cause Elizabeth fell over and landed right in the puddle, getting muddy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She often sticks her hands in the air as if to raise the roof. (B) Elizabeth wore high heels on a rainy day.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Elizabeth wore high heels on a rainy day.\nExplanation: Wearing high heels on a rainy day can be very dangerous as the heels can easily slip on wet surfaces. Elizabeth's proper nature may have caused her to prioritize fashion over practicality, leading to her falling over and getting muddy. On the other hand, sticking her hands in the air as if to raise the roof seems unlikely to cause her to fall into a puddle."}}
{"Q": "Jess had a job as a aircraft cleaner. Which event could cause Her boss told her to stop keeping books?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jess loves all the books that she finds on the planes. (B) Jess never kept books on the side and was very tired.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jess's love for the books she finds on the planes could cause her boss to tell her to stop keeping them, as it could be seen as a distraction from her job duties and potentially lead to theft or loss of company property. Option B does not provide a clear reason for why her boss would tell her to stop keeping books."}}
{"Q": "The Smith's could not find their cat. Which event could cause The Smith's cat meowed at the front door?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The Smiths cat escaped out of the front door. (B) The Smith's cat escaped to the basement.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The Smiths cat escaped out of the front door.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the cat meowed at the front door because it was trying to get back inside the house after accidentally escaping through the front door. It is less likely that the cat would meow at the basement door if it had never been down there before and was not familiar with that area of the house."}}
{"Q": "Jed followed the instructions to compile Chromium OS. Which event could cause Finally he gave up, and learned to love Windows?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jed found it very easy to compile. (B) It was very difficult though.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) It was very difficult though.\nExplanation: Compiling Chromium OS can be a complex and time-consuming process, requiring a significant amount of technical knowledge and expertise. If Jed found the process to be too difficult or frustrating, he may have given up and switched to a more user-friendly operating system like Windows."}}
{"Q": "Arthur was smitten with the boss's daughter, Anka. Which event could cause It wasn't long before he learned first hand of her peanut allergy?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Arthur worshipped her from afar. (B) Arthur made Anka a wonderful peanut brittle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Arthur made Anka a wonderful peanut brittle.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it involves direct interaction between Arthur and Anka, and the fact that he made peanut brittle for her suggests that he may not have been aware of her peanut allergy. This would lead to a potentially dangerous situation where Anka could have had an allergic reaction, causing Arthur to learn about her allergy first hand. On the other hand, choice (A) suggests that Arthur never had any direct contact with Anka, making it less likely that he would learn about her peanut allergy."}}
{"Q": "Last April I woke to the sound of tornado sirens. Which event could cause When it was over we looked outside at the destruction?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) April spent the night in the basement. (B) I had to go outside to wait out the tornado.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the person had spent the night in the basement, they would not have been able to look outside at the destruction. Option B is more plausible as it suggests that the person had to go outside after the tornado had passed to wait it out and then saw the destruction."}}
{"Q": "My friend had a Yerbie Frisbee that goes really far. Which event could cause We never saw that Frisbee again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My friend threw the frisbee a foot. (B) A dog came along and took it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a dog came along and took the Frisbee, as dogs are known to be attracted to and often take objects like Frisbees. It is less likely that the Frisbee would disappear after being thrown only a foot, as it would still be within sight and easy to retrieve."}}
{"Q": "Ashley was going to the cafeteria for lunch. Which event could cause After that she was the only one in the lunch line?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She got in line for lunch with everyone else. (B) People learned a cheese burger is not on today's menu.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) People learned a cheese burger is not on today's menu.\nExplanation: If people learned that a cheese burger is not on today's menu, they may choose to go elsewhere for lunch or opt for a different menu item. This would result in Ashley being the only one left in the lunch line. Option (A) does not provide a reason for why Ashley would be the only one in the lunch line."}}
{"Q": "Mike decided to volunteer for a farm. Which event could cause But he was given lots of free vegetables?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mike didn't actually like it very much. (B) It was fun work for a lot of pay.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Mike didn't actually like it very much.\nExplanation: If Mike didn't enjoy volunteering on the farm, it's possible that the farmer gave him lots of free vegetables as a way to thank him for his time and effort. This could be seen as a gesture of appreciation and an attempt to make the experience more positive for Mike. On the other hand, if Mike enjoyed the work and found it rewarding, he might have been willing to do it for free and wouldn't necessarily need to be compensated with free vegetables. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Me and my friends were hanging out. Which event could cause Afterwards, we went to a diner and got food?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We felt full when we were hanging out. (B) We got bored and started playing a video game. Then we got hungry.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the group got hungry after playing a video game and getting bored, rather than feeling full from hanging out. Playing a video game can be a mentally stimulating activity that can work up an appetite, leading the group to go to a diner and get food afterwards."}}
{"Q": "Ana had been putting off doing laundry. Which event could cause Ana took several hours drying medicinal herbs?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Other things had to do her first though. (B) She had to do other things first though.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Ana had been putting off doing laundry because she had other things to do first, it is plausible that she would take several hours drying medicinal herbs before finally getting around to doing the laundry. This suggests that Ana may have a tendency to procrastinate or prioritize other tasks over laundry."}}
{"Q": "Leo showed me a trick at movie theaters last week. Which event could cause It smelled fresh, and I was glad someone had been so wasteful earlier?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He said people leave things behind. We found sanitiser!. (B) Leo showed me how to record movies on my phone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Leo mentioning that people leave things behind at movie theaters could explain why the area smelled fresh and why they were able to find sanitizer. It's possible that someone had left the sanitizer behind, making it available for Leo and the speaker to use. On the other hand, Leo showing the speaker how to record movies on their phone doesn't seem related to the fresh smell or the presence of sanitizer."}}
{"Q": "Tom saw a friendly dog while walking through the city. Which event could cause He took home a great dog and made a new best friend?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The dog was malnourished. (B) Tom befriend the dog and took him to a shelter.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Tom befriended the dog and took him to a shelter, it is possible that he could have developed a bond with the dog and decided to adopt him. Taking the dog to a shelter also suggests that Tom cares about the dog's well-being and wants to ensure that he is properly taken care of. On the other hand, if the dog was malnourished, it is less likely that Tom would have taken him home immediately without first ensuring that the dog was healthy and properly cared for."}}
{"Q": "Lily's favorite doll broke. Which event could cause Finally, the doll came back in perfect condition?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lily's parents took the doll to a toy shop. (B) Lily's grandmother broke her doll.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Lily's parents took the doll to a toy shop.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lily's parents took the doll to a toy shop to get it fixed rather than Lily's grandmother breaking her doll and magically fixing Lily's doll in the process. Therefore, it is more likely that the doll was repaired by professionals at a toy shop."}}
{"Q": "Rick played saxophone in the marching band. Which event could cause Rick now plays the trombone?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rick bought a trombone. (B) Rick grew bored, and wanted to try a new hobby.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Rick bought a trombone.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rick switched to playing the trombone because he acquired one, rather than simply growing bored and wanting to try a new hobby. As a former member of the marching band, Rick likely has a passion for music and would not give up playing an instrument without a good reason. Therefore, it is more likely that he switched to the trombone because he had access to one and wanted to try something new within the realm of music."}}
{"Q": "Jim went to the beach. Which event could cause Jim was angry at his sister?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jim's sister ditched him. (B) Jim's sister poured sand in the bucket.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Jim's sister ditched him, it is more likely to cause him to be angry as he may feel abandoned or betrayed. Pouring sand in the bucket may be annoying, but it is not as significant as being left alone at the beach."}}
{"Q": "Schmidt had to take the bus to work. Which event could cause He got written up at work?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The bus was early picking Schmidt up. (B) Schmidt missed his stop was late to work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Schmidt missed his stop was late to work.\nExplanation: If Schmidt missed his stop and was late to work, it would be a valid reason for him to get written up at work. However, if the bus was early picking him up, it would not be his fault and would not result in him getting written up."}}
{"Q": "When Marlene graduated she went to work for her Uncle in California. Which event could cause Now Marline works as a maid at the hotel down the street?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her Uncle owned a hotel. (B) She did not get along with him and cried.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Marlene did not get along with her Uncle and left his employment, leading her to find work as a maid at a nearby hotel. It is less likely that her Uncle owning a hotel would directly lead to her becoming a maid at a different hotel."}}
{"Q": "People shook their heads because Stu wouldn't buy a car. Which event could cause Stu rode his bike to visit them at the cemetery regularly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Stu's parents recovered from a car accident. (B) Stu's parents were killed in a car accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Stu's parents were killed in a car accident.\nExplanation: If Stu's parents were killed in a car accident, it would make sense for him to not want to buy a car and instead rely on his bike for transportation. Additionally, visiting his parents' graves regularly would be a plausible reason for him to ride his bike to the cemetery. On the other hand, if his parents recovered from a car accident, it wouldn't necessarily explain why Stu wouldn't buy a car and ride his bike instead."}}
{"Q": "I recall the one hit I got in Little League Which event could cause I made it to first just in time, not believing what I'd finally done?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I hit a foul ball right between the stands and third base. (B) I was very excited about the accomplishment.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If the narrator hit a foul ball between the stands and third base, it's possible that the fielders were unable to retrieve the ball in time for the narrator to make it to first base. This would be a plausible explanation for the narrator's surprise and disbelief at finally getting a hit. Option B doesn't provide a logical explanation for the narrator's success on the field."}}
{"Q": "Frankie had Christmas shopping to do. Which event could cause She paid and took her things home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Frankie went shopping and picked out some gifts. (B) Frankie went to the hardware store.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Choice A is the more plausible answer because it directly relates to Christmas shopping and the action of picking out gifts. Choice B, going to the hardware store, does not seem to be related to Christmas shopping and therefore is less likely to result in Frankie paying for and taking home her gifts."}}
{"Q": "Billy and Rob were angry at each other over a proposed trade. Which event could cause Not wanting to be known as a cheater, Billy is out to confront Rob?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rob ended up cheating. (B) Rob told people that Billy cheated him in the trade.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Rob told people that Billy cheated him in the trade, it would damage Billy's reputation and credibility. Therefore, Billy would want to confront Rob to clear his name and defend himself against the accusations. On the other hand, if Rob ended up cheating, Billy would have no reason to confront him as the trade would have already been nullified."}}
{"Q": "I used to have this girlfriend who was so needy. Which event could cause After a few months I ended up breaking up with her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My girlfriend wanted to be with me all the time and would never let me hang out with my friends. (B) Her constant begging was sexy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the reason for the breakup was the girlfriend's neediness and clinginess, as indicated by choice A. This behavior can be suffocating and can lead to a lack of personal space and freedom, which can ultimately strain the relationship. Choice B, on the other hand, is unlikely to be a reason for a breakup as it suggests a positive aspect of the relationship."}}
{"Q": "The cat chased the mouse across the empty warehouse. Which event could cause The cat decided to lay down and take a nap?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The mouse was too fast for the cat. (B) The mouse chased the cat back to his hole.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The mouse was too fast for the cat.\nExplanation: If the mouse was too fast for the cat, it is possible that the cat became tired and decided to take a nap. On the other hand, if the mouse chased the cat back to his hole, it is unlikely that the cat would feel comfortable enough to take a nap in the same area where it was just chased by the mouse. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Luke's grass in his yard was growing fast. Which event could cause Now Luke's yard is always well maintenanced?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Luke hired a company to pull up the grass. (B) Luke bought a new lawn mower to trim his lawn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Luke bought a new lawn mower to trim his lawn.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Luke would take action to maintain his yard rather than completely removing the grass. Buying a new lawn mower would allow him to easily trim the grass and keep it well-maintained."}}
{"Q": "I drove my motorcycle across the street. Which event could cause I changed the wifi password to enhance security?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Across the street was a bar where I drank too much, and told all the patrons my wifi password. (B) Across the street was a bar I enver drank at and didn't tell anyone my wifi password.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person may have shared their wifi password with strangers at the bar after drinking too much, which could compromise the security of their network. Changing the password would be a logical step to enhance security in this scenario. Option (B) does not provide any reason for the person to change their wifi password."}}
{"Q": "Robert was planning on having a nice dinner with his girlfriend Kate. Which event could cause However she lied to Robert and told him she loved it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kate was planning on breaking up with David. (B) She didn't really like it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She didn't really like it.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kate didn't really like the dinner but lied to Robert to avoid hurting his feelings or ruining the evening. It is less likely that her planning to break up with David would cause her to lie about enjoying the dinner."}}
{"Q": "Justin was carefully finishing his watercolor painting in art class. Which event could cause Justin was sad but decided to be kind to Laura?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Laura made a rude comment about his painting. (B) His friend Laura brought new paints so he gave her his.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Laura made a rude comment about his painting.\nExplanation: If Laura made a rude comment about Justin's painting, it could have caused him to feel sad. However, Justin decided to be kind to Laura despite her comment, showing maturity and kindness. On the other hand, if Laura brought new paints and Justin gave her his, it would not necessarily cause him to feel sad. It may have been a kind gesture, but it does not explain why Justin was sad in the first place."}}
{"Q": "Maureen notices that she is having trouble seeing things far away. Which event could cause Maureen is happy that she can see well again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Maureen decided to make an appointment to get her eye sight checked which was 20/20. (B) She went to the eye doctor and got glasses.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Maureen is having trouble seeing things far away, it is likely that she has myopia (nearsightedness) or another vision problem that requires corrective lenses. Going to the eye doctor and getting glasses would be the most plausible solution to her vision problems. While it is possible that Maureen's eyesight is already 20/20 and she simply needs to adjust to her vision, this is less likely than her needing corrective lenses."}}
{"Q": "Neshay was making her famous chicken dinner for her boyfriend. Which event could cause When he finished her told her it was the best he ever ate?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He added some more spice and herbs to the chicken. (B) He was excited to eat it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boyfriend's excitement to eat the chicken dinner would cause him to say it was the best he ever ate, rather than him adding more spice and herbs to the already cooked chicken."}}
{"Q": "I always wanted fancy socks. Which event could cause I was ashamed of what I had done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I bought a pair of socks I thought were really fancy but looked very ugly. (B) I bought a pair of socks I thought were really fancy but looked very ugly, so I returned them.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the person bought a pair of socks they thought were fancy but ended up looking ugly, they may feel embarrassed or ashamed of their fashion choice. However, if they returned the socks, it shows that they were proactive in correcting their mistake and may not feel as ashamed. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Neil loved the Middle East. Which event could cause He found Bahrain was every bit as lovely as he had dreamed?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Neil decided to travel to the Far East. (B) Neil saved up for a two week vacation and visited the entire area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Neil saved up for a two week vacation and visited the entire area.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Neil actually visited Bahrain and had the opportunity to experience its beauty firsthand. Option (A) suggests that Neil did not actually visit Bahrain and instead traveled to a different region, making it less likely that he would have found Bahrain to be as lovely as he had dreamed."}}
{"Q": "Lucy and her grandma went to Walmart. Which event could cause It wasn't what she wanted, but it was better than nothing at all?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy's wanted candy, but her grandma bought her an apple. (B) Grandma made Lucy turn tricks for money.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it involves a common scenario where a child wants something specific but is given something else instead. It is unlikely that a grandmother would make her granddaughter engage in prostitution for money."}}
{"Q": "My flight to Korea was today. Which event could cause I realized that this place is a little different from my home town?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) When I got there, I knew none of the language. (B) I got there early and decided to stay in my hotel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the person did not know the language when they arrived in Korea, it would be a clear indication that they are in a different place from their home town. On the other hand, deciding to stay in a hotel early would not necessarily give any indication of cultural differences."}}
{"Q": "Tess wanted to make her family pizza for dinner. Which event could cause She ordered a takeout pizza, which her family loved?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tess didn't feel like spending money. (B) But her oven was broken.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) But her oven was broken.\nExplanation: If Tess's oven was broken, she wouldn't be able to make pizza at home. Ordering takeout pizza would be a logical solution in this situation. Choice (A) doesn't provide a clear reason for why Tess would order takeout pizza instead of making it herself."}}
{"Q": "Karen didn't have a boyfriend for Valentine's Day. Which event could cause Her brother's thoughtfulness made her Valentine's Day special?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Karen decided to buy her brother a Valentine's gift. (B) Karens little brother handed her a box of chocolates.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Karens little brother handed her a box of chocolates.\nExplanation: Since Karen didn't have a boyfriend for Valentine's Day, her little brother's thoughtfulness in giving her a box of chocolates could have made her day special. It shows that someone cares for her and wants to make her happy on this day. On the other hand, Karen buying her brother a Valentine's gift may have been a nice gesture, but it wouldn't have made her own Valentine's Day special."}}
{"Q": "Dana's son had some homework. Which event could cause They finished the worksheet quickly?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Dana's son was working on a worksheet with mom. (B) Dana's son helped Dana finish it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Dana's son was working on the worksheet with his mom, it is likely that they were able to finish it quickly as they were working together. However, if Dana's son helped Dana finish it, it is unclear how much of the worksheet he actually completed himself and it may not have been finished quickly."}}
{"Q": "Mary went to a cafe. Which event could cause They decided they would go to the park together on Saturday?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) At the cafe, Mike caught up with an old friend. (B) Mary ran into an ex boyfriend at the cafe.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Mike caught up with an old friend at the cafe, it is possible that they made plans to hang out on Saturday and invited Mary to join them. This could have led to the decision to go to the park together. On the other hand, running into an ex boyfriend may not necessarily lead to making plans with someone else."}}
{"Q": "Ronnie was hanging out with his friends after school. Which event could cause Ronnie got caught by the cashier and he got in big trouble afterwards?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ronnie and his friends took candy from a store without paying for it. (B) Ronnie left his friends when they decided to steal a candy bar.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Ronnie and his friends took candy from a store without paying for it, they would be committing theft and could be caught by the cashier or store security. This would result in Ronnie getting in big trouble afterwards. On the other hand, if Ronnie left his friends when they decided to steal a candy bar, he would not be involved in the theft and would not get in trouble. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Gina had checked out a book from the library. Which event could cause She knew she had to go home and search her house to find it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gina got a late fee on the book. (B) she had to get something to eat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Gina got a late fee on the book.\nExplanation: If Gina got a late fee on the book, it would indicate that the book was due back at the library and she had not returned it. This would prompt her to search her house to find the book so she could return it and avoid further fees. On the other hand, needing to get something to eat would not necessarily be related to finding the book and would not be a strong enough reason for her to search her house."}}
{"Q": "Lucy's grandma was teaching her to sew. Which event could cause Lucy finally agreed to start with a pillow?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lucy wanted to try something difficult but her grandma told her to do a pillow. (B) Lucy decided not to sew.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lucy wanted to challenge herself and try something difficult, but her grandma suggested starting with a pillow to build her skills and confidence. This is a common teaching technique in sewing and other crafts, to start with a simple project before moving on to more complex ones. It is less likely that Lucy would simply give up on sewing altogether without any reason or encouragement from her grandma."}}
{"Q": "Julius was tired of waking up to his noisy neighbors. Which event could cause Julius then decided to move and was happy with the decision?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Julius thought about looking for new places to live. (B) Julius began the process of house hunting.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. \nExplanation: Once Julius begins the process of house hunting, he is actively taking steps towards finding a new place to live. This shows that he is serious about his decision to move and is actively seeking a solution to his problem with his noisy neighbors. Once he finds a new place to live, he will likely be happy with his decision to move and escape the noise. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Jason had doubts about starting a new relationship. Which event could cause When he woke up the next morning, he thought an angel was next to him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jason had his new girlfriend stay over one night. (B) Jason didn't meet anyone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jason had his new girlfriend stay over one night.\nExplanation: If Jason had his new girlfriend stay over one night, it would be more plausible for him to wake up and think she was an angel next to him. This could be due to the excitement and happiness of starting a new relationship, causing him to have positive thoughts and feelings towards his partner. On the other hand, if Jason didn't meet anyone, it would be unlikely for him to wake up and think an angel was next to him without any logical explanation."}}
{"Q": "Amy was 19 and she needed a job. Which event could cause It was further than she liked, but Amy was happy to have a job?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Amy got a job at the mall. (B) Amy got a job next door.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Amy got a job at the mall.\nExplanation: Getting a job at the mall implies that Amy had to travel a certain distance to get to work. However, since she needed a job, she was happy to have found one even if it was further than she would have liked. On the other hand, getting a job next door would not have caused her to feel happy about the distance since it would have been very close to her."}}
{"Q": "Nate went to the movies! Which event could cause But he ate so much he ended up missing the movie?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Nate went to the buffet beforehand. (B) He didn't eat a lot of food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Nate went to the buffet beforehand.\nExplanation: If Nate went to a buffet beforehand and ate too much, it is more likely that he would miss the movie due to feeling too full or experiencing discomfort. On the other hand, if he didn't eat a lot of food, it is less likely that he would miss the movie due to overeating."}}
{"Q": "Wyman and his family were tent camping. Which event could cause They saw bear prints around the picnic table?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wyman and his family inspected the area and found nothing scary. (B) Wyman thought he heard growling coming from the picnic area.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Wyman and his family inspected the area and found nothing scary, it is unlikely that they would have seen bear prints. However, if Wyman thought he heard growling coming from the picnic area, it is plausible that a bear could have left prints in the area."}}
{"Q": "Jerry was always made fun of at work. Which event could cause He now gets to tell those coworkers what to do?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He decided to put all his energy into getting a promotion. (B) He decided to put all his energy into getting laid.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Putting all his energy into getting a promotion would suggest that Jerry worked hard and demonstrated his abilities to his superiors, leading to a promotion and a higher position of authority over his coworkers. On the other hand, putting all his energy into getting laid would not necessarily lead to a change in his work situation or give him the authority to tell his coworkers what to do."}}
{"Q": "Jason went to a soup kitchen to get some food. Which event could cause After eating, Jason realized the kitchen does need more cultural?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The soup was very spicy. (B) The soup was very bland.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the soup was very bland, it is more likely that Jason would realize the kitchen needs more cultural diversity in their recipes. If the soup was very spicy, it would not necessarily lead to this realization."}}
{"Q": "Cody works in retail, at Target. Which event could cause Unfortunately, he has to close again tomorrow?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) he talked to his boss about trying to get earlier hours. (B) Cody hated working days and preferred the late shift.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Cody's personal preference for working the late shift is not a valid reason for having to close again tomorrow. However, if there is a sudden change in the store's operating hours or staffing needs, it could result in Cody having to close again tomorrow. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Joe tripped carrying a carton of milk. Which event could cause They seemed grumpy when he wiped up the spill?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe saw employees looking at him. (B) Luckily, the carton didn't break.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that the employees looking at Joe after he tripped and spilled milk would cause them to seem grumpy when he wiped up the spill. They may have been annoyed at the mess or felt that Joe was being careless. The fact that the carton didn't break is not directly related to their grumpiness."}}
{"Q": "Gina was a new girl on a private, elite college campus. Which event could cause She had been pranked, as it wasn't a costume party?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She joioned a serority on campus. (B) She joined a gang on campus.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She joined a sorority on campus.\nExplanation: Joining a sorority on a private, elite college campus often involves initiation rituals and pranks, especially during the pledging process. It is not uncommon for new members to be pranked by older members as a way of bonding and testing their commitment to the sorority. On the other hand, joining a gang on a college campus is highly unlikely and would not be tolerated by the administration."}}
{"Q": "Kelly decided to make some granola homemade. Which event could cause She saw the oats burned and she immediately shut the oven off?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly got distracted but remembered her oats in the oven. (B) Kelly left the kitchen to go to the bathroom and came back right to the kitchen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Kelly was actively monitoring the oats in the oven and noticed that they were burning. Option B suggests that Kelly left the kitchen completely and came back to find the oats burned, which is less likely."}}
{"Q": "Billy was walking at Central Park. Which event could cause Billy ended up very wet from his walk at the park?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It started raining during Billy's walk. (B) It started raining after Billy got home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It started raining during Billy's walk.\nExplanation: If it started raining during Billy's walk, he would not have had time to seek shelter and would have ended up getting wet. If it started raining after he got home, he would have been able to avoid getting wet altogether. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lynette hated being the older child. Which event could cause Lynette still babysits to help the family?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Lynette felt her working parents should pay for a babysitter. (B) Lynette had to babysit her siblings.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Lynette had to babysit her siblings.\nExplanation: Even though Lynette hated being the older child, she may still feel a sense of responsibility towards her younger siblings and want to help out her working parents. Additionally, Lynette may not want her parents to spend money on a babysitter when she is capable of taking care of her siblings. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lynette still babysits to help the family because she feels a sense of responsibility towards her siblings and wants to save her parents money."}}
{"Q": "My sister was failing her science class at school. Which event could cause She ended up passing her class with my help?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I helped my sister study. (B) I asked them for help.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I helped my sister study.\nExplanation: By helping her study, she was able to better understand the material and improve her grades. Asking for help may have also been beneficial, but actively studying and reviewing the material with assistance is more likely to result in a passing grade."}}
{"Q": "Ray was looking for a birthday present for his mom. Which event could cause Ray's mom was really surprised and happy with the Fitbit Ray bought?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He bought her the apple watch she always wanted. (B) Ray's mom recently started walking to lose weight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Ray's mom recently started walking to lose weight, so a Fitbit would be a perfect gift to help her track her progress and motivate her to keep going. While an Apple Watch may also be a nice gift, it may not have the same practical use for someone who is specifically focused on fitness and weight loss. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "John was an elementary school student. Which event could cause John went on to become a famous musician?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John was very good at music but grew out of it. (B) John was not very good at music in elementary school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Neither option A nor B seems to be a plausible answer for John becoming a famous musician. \n\nExplanation: Becoming a famous musician requires a lot of hard work, dedication, and talent. Option A suggests that John was good at music but lost interest in it, which is not a typical path for someone who becomes a famous musician. Option B suggests that John was not good at music in elementary school, which is also not a typical path for someone who becomes a famous musician. It is more likely that John had a passion for music, worked hard to develop his skills, and had some natural talent that he honed over time. Other factors, such as opportunities, connections, and luck, may have also played a role in his success."}}
{"Q": "Sally had been out all night. Which event could cause Finally, she made it to her room?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Sally was awake and wanted to go back to the pool. (B) Sally was tipsy, and had trouble finding her way.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Sally had been out all night and was tipsy, it is more plausible that she had trouble finding her way back to her room. It is less likely that she would have been awake all night and then suddenly decided to go back to the pool."}}
{"Q": "Todd was excited about being on his junior high basketball team. Which event could cause Todd eventually dropped from the team, mad that he never got to play?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Todd was on the playing roaster during every game. (B) Todd's coach always sidelined him because he was new on the team.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Todd's coach always sidelined him because he was new on the team.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Todd's lack of playing time was due to his coach's decision to sideline him because he was new on the team. It is common for coaches to give more playing time to experienced players and gradually integrate new players into the team. If Todd was on the playing roster during every game, it is unlikely that he would be dropped from the team for not playing."}}
{"Q": "Tim never smoked before. Which event could cause He was punished but it was too late?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He decided it would be terrible to try out. (B) His friend talked him into trying a cigarette and he liked it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) His friend talked him into trying a cigarette and he liked it.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tim's curiosity or peer pressure from his friend could lead him to try smoking for the first time. If he enjoyed it, he may continue to smoke despite the potential consequences. Being punished for smoking would come too late to prevent him from trying it in the first place."}}
{"Q": "I was at work when it started snowing. Which event could cause We had a lazy snow day?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) By the afternoon the office was closed on account of the weather. (B) My boss kept up from going home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) By the afternoon the office was closed on account of the weather.\nExplanation: If the office was closed due to the weather, it would be more likely that everyone would have a lazy snow day as they would not have to work. On the other hand, if the boss kept the employees from going home, it would not necessarily result in a lazy snow day as they would still have to work."}}
{"Q": "At the age of 27 I weighed 300 pounds. Which event could cause After a year, I lost 100 lbs and completed a marathon?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I had to diet and exercise or die young. (B) I worked hard with my doctor to gain my weight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Losing 100 pounds in a year and completing a marathon requires a significant lifestyle change, which is most likely due to a serious health concern. The statement \"I had to diet and exercise or die young\" suggests that the individual was motivated to make a change in order to improve their health and avoid potential health risks associated with obesity. Working with a doctor to gain weight (option B) does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Ana had been putting off doing laundry. Which event could cause Ana decided never to wait that long again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She had so much to do it took an hour to finish. (B) Ana had multiple loads to wash.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Ana had multiple loads to wash, it would indicate that she had let her laundry pile up for a significant amount of time. This could be a more plausible reason for her to decide never to wait that long again, as it would be a more overwhelming task to tackle. If it only took an hour to finish, it may not be enough of a deterrent for Ana to change her habits."}}
{"Q": "Wyatt and his friends were in class. Which event could cause In the end, he decided not to and stood up for the girl instead?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Wyatt was making fun of a girl. (B) Wyatt's friends were making fun of a girl.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Wyatt's friends were making fun of a girl.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Wyatt would stand up for the girl if his friends were the ones making fun of her, rather than Wyatt himself. This shows that Wyatt has a sense of empathy and is willing to go against his friends to do what is right."}}
{"Q": "Eli was very tired when he got home. Which event could cause He plopped down in front of the television with a microwave dinner?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Eli didn't have the energy to make himself a cooked meal. (B) Too fatigued to cook, Eli warmed up a frozen dinner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Too fatigued to cook, Eli warmed up a frozen dinner.\nExplanation: The fact that Eli was very tired suggests that he did not have the energy to cook a meal from scratch. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would opt for a quick and easy option like a microwave dinner that he could heat up quickly. Choice (B) reflects this scenario, making it the more likely answer."}}
{"Q": "A few years ago, everyone around me was learning to skateboard. Which event could cause I never learned to skate properly?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I decided to try it, but never cared. (B) I untried to join in once, but could not balance on a board.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I untried to join in once, but could not balance on a board.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that the person did try to learn how to skateboard but was unable to balance on the board. This could have been a discouraging experience that caused them to give up on learning to skate properly. Option (A) suggests that the person never really cared to learn, which is less likely if everyone around them was learning and enjoying it."}}
{"Q": "I found a trolley part in the garbage near a carhouse. Which event could cause I went back to the carhouse but found nothing else?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I thought there might be more parts around. (B) I wanted to see if I could return it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the person found a trolley part in the garbage near a carhouse, it is plausible that they would think there might be more parts around and go back to check. On the other hand, wanting to return the part seems less likely as it was found in the garbage and may not have any identifying information."}}
{"Q": "Bill decided to go to the gym for exercise. Which event could cause He stopped along the way to purchase a smoothie?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Bill realized he hadn't eaten all decade. (B) Bill wanted to eat something before going to the gym.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Bill wanted to eat something before going to the gym.\nExplanation: It is common for people to eat something before exercising to provide energy and prevent low blood sugar levels. Therefore, it is more plausible that Bill stopped to purchase a smoothie because he wanted to eat something before going to the gym. Option (A) is an exaggeration and not a likely reason for stopping to purchase a smoothie."}}
{"Q": "Rod bought his mom a locket for her birthday. Which event could cause He gave them to his mom in her new locket?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Rod then took pictures of his mom and his wife to complete the gift. (B) He had photos taken of his children.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Since Rod bought a locket for his mom, it is more plausible that he would give her a gift that includes pictures of her loved ones. Option A states that he took pictures of his mom and wife to complete the gift, which is a more likely scenario than option B where he had photos taken of his children, as there is no mention of his children in the question."}}
{"Q": "Sam loved cooking, but her school had no cooking club. Which event could cause Now Sam cooks, helps - and looks great on her college forms?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Luckily the next semester they did offer some other good clubs. (B) So instead Sam got a job in a restaurant kitchen.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Luckily the next semester they did offer some other good clubs.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it suggests that Sam found a cooking club at her school in the next semester, which allowed her to pursue her passion for cooking and also participate in a school club. This would also look good on her college forms as it shows her involvement in extracurricular activities. Option B suggests that Sam got a job in a restaurant kitchen, which may not be feasible for a high school student and may not necessarily lead to her looking great on college forms."}}
{"Q": "Sam and Tom were fighting over a blanket. Which event could cause Sam pulled harder and won the fight?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They were pulling it back and forth. (B) They both ate as much as they could.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Sam and Tom were pulling the blanket back and forth, it would create a situation where one person could pull harder and gain an advantage over the other. Eating as much as they could would not have any effect on the outcome of the fight over the blanket. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ellen dreamed of winning a prize for her roses. Which event could cause Ellen had to pay a replacement fee for her library card?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She sent her credit card by mistake when she entered the contest. (B) She decided to go to the library to do some research, but could not find her library card.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ellen lost her library card and had to pay a replacement fee than accidentally sending her credit card in a contest for roses. Losing a library card is a common occurrence, while accidentally sending a credit card in a contest is unlikely."}}
{"Q": "Dan was not very good at Math. Which event could cause It was easy for him, and he felt much better about his math skills?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He found a tutor who taught them a different way to think about math. (B) Dan studied and got a D on the math test.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Finding a tutor who teaches math in a different way can help Dan understand the subject better and improve his skills. Getting a D on a math test may not necessarily make him feel better about his math skills, as it indicates that he still needs improvement. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Only two buses went anywhere near Laura's street. Which event could cause Laura had to get off and walk two miles home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Laura already missed the two buses. (B) The bus stopped next door to her house in front of a store.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If the bus stopped next door to her house in front of a store, it is possible that Laura got off the bus and walked the remaining distance home. However, if Laura had already missed the two buses, she would not have had the option to get off and walk home."}}
{"Q": "Dan wanted to find the perfect gift for his mother's birthday. Which event could cause Dan explained the situation and his mother was not upset?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan lost his pants. (B) He bought her a set of roses but dropped them on his way in to the house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He bought her a set of roses but dropped them on his way in to the house.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is related to the situation of finding the perfect gift for his mother's birthday. Dropping the roses may have been an accident and not intentional, and his mother may understand and appreciate the effort he put into finding a gift for her. Losing his pants, on the other hand, is not related to the situation and may not have any impact on his mother's reaction."}}
{"Q": "I always wanted fancy socks. Which event could cause I loved my new socks?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I bought a pair at the store. (B) I wasn't able to save up for a new pair of socks.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I bought a pair at the store.\nExplanation: If the person always wanted fancy socks, it is more likely that they would love their new socks if they were able to purchase a pair at the store. This would fulfill their desire for fancy socks and bring them joy. On the other hand, not being able to save up for a new pair of socks would likely cause disappointment and frustration, rather than love for the socks."}}
{"Q": "Julian was mad after being fired from a diner. Which event could cause They knew it was him and banned him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Julian was sneaking food into the kitchen. (B) Julian decided to brake on window and the diner.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Sneaking food into the kitchen is a more plausible reason for being banned from a diner than breaking a window. It is also a common reason for termination in the food service industry. Breaking a window would likely result in legal consequences rather than just being banned from the diner."}}
{"Q": "Johnny was afraid to hold sparklers. Which event could cause He hoped he would be brave enough next time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Johnny nervously held the sparklers. (B) Johnny declined to hold the sparklers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Johnny nervously held the sparklers.\nExplanation: If Johnny declined to hold the sparklers, it would not make sense for him to hope to be brave enough next time. However, if he nervously held the sparklers, it shows that he was willing to try and overcome his fear, and he may hope to be even braver next time."}}
{"Q": "Jasmine and her sister live near a wooded area. Which event could cause Both girls had a great time running around the trees?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jasmine and her sister loved to play in the woods. (B) The weather was rainy so they went out to play in it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jasmine and her sister loved to play in the woods.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly states that the girls enjoyed playing in the woods, which is a likely reason for them to have a great time running around the trees. The weather being rainy (option B) may not necessarily be a reason for them to have fun, as it could make the ground slippery and dangerous to run on."}}
{"Q": "We found ants in the water of our Keurig. Which event could cause They are finally gone, although we do not know the reason?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We washed our Keurig really well. (B) we left it alone and didn't clean it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. We washed our Keurig really well.\nExplanation: It is more likely that washing the Keurig well would remove any residue or food particles that may have attracted the ants, leading to their disappearance. Leaving it alone and not cleaning it would not address the issue and may even make it worse."}}
{"Q": "James was searching for oil in North Dakota. Which event could cause James sold the oil for a very nice profit?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) James bought land with oil underneath. (B) He lost some oil on some private land.", "R": {"text": "Answer: James bought land with oil underneath.\nExplanation: If James bought land with oil underneath, he would have the rights to extract and sell the oil, which could result in a profitable venture. On the other hand, losing some oil on private land would not necessarily lead to a significant profit."}}
{"Q": "The girls in town formed a new soccer team. Which event could cause Because of their hard work, they won their first game?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The girls worked soft and practiced daily. (B) The girls practiced many hours a week.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The girls practiced many hours a week.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the girls won their first game because they put in a lot of effort and practice, rather than just working softly and practicing daily. Practicing many hours a week would have given them more time to improve their skills and work on their teamwork, leading to a better chance of winning their first game."}}
{"Q": "Sarah loved cooking. Which event could cause Sarah was touched and encouraged to cook more?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sarah's friends loved her food. (B) Sarah got a record as a gift.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Sarah's friends loving her food would be a more plausible event to encourage her to cook more because it shows that her cooking is appreciated and enjoyed by others. Getting a record as a gift may not necessarily have a direct connection to cooking and may not inspire her to cook more."}}
{"Q": "Christopher moved to a new part of town because of a new job. Which event could cause Christopher will keep a map in his car from now on?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He knew exactly where to go to the new job. (B) He got lost going to the new job.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Christopher got lost going to the new job, he would likely want to keep a map in his car to prevent getting lost again in the future. If he knew exactly where to go, he may not feel the need to keep a map in his car."}}
{"Q": "Ellen dreamed of winning a prize for her roses. Which event could cause Ellen ended up winning the prize?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ellen took care of her roses very well. (B) Ellen's roses were beautiful!.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Ellen took care of her roses very well.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Ellen winning the prize for her roses is a result of her taking good care of them. Beautiful roses alone may not be enough to win a prize, as judges may also consider factors such as the health and maintenance of the plants. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Ellen's hard work and dedication in caring for her roses led to her winning the prize."}}
{"Q": "Nick's neighbors played music as loud as they could. Which event could cause The situation was not resolved, but Nick felt better?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Nick called no one to report the noise. (B) Nick asked them to turn it down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Nick called no one to report the noise, he may have found other ways to cope with the situation, such as using earplugs or finding a quieter place in his home. While the noise may not have been resolved, Nick may have felt better knowing that he took some action to address the situation."}}
{"Q": "Jane loves music. Which event could cause Jane rushed to the office and was twenty minutes late to the concert?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jane had concert tickets she left at work. (B) Jane was going to watch a performance on video but had to stop at work first.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jane had concert tickets she left at work.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because Jane loves music and would likely have purchased tickets to the concert in advance. If she left the tickets at work, she would have to rush back to retrieve them, causing her to be late to the concert. Option B is less likely because if Jane was going to watch a performance on video, she could have done so at any time and would not have needed to rush to the office before the concert."}}
{"Q": "Miles decided to join a book club in his town to meet people. Which event could cause Miles was very happy that he joined the book club?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Miles met a lot of people his own age. (B) Miles made new friends in the club.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Miles joined the book club to meet people, so it is more plausible that he would be very happy if he made new friends in the club. While meeting people his own age is a possibility, it is not necessarily a guarantee that he would make friends with them. Making new friends in the club would fulfill his goal of meeting people and also provide him with a sense of belonging and community."}}
{"Q": "Kate was jogging one day. Which event could cause Then she returned the phone to its grateful owner?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kate found a iphone while jogging. (B) Kate lost a phone on the path.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Kate found an iPhone while jogging.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is common for people to lose or drop their phones while exercising. Kate may have noticed the phone on the ground and picked it up, then used it to contact the owner and return it to them. It is less likely that Kate would lose her own phone while jogging and then miraculously find it again on the path."}}
{"Q": "Freddy was going through sleep paralysis. Which event could cause His body started moving again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Freddy ran through the streets all night. (B) He concentrated hard on waking himself up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He concentrated hard on waking himself up.\nExplanation: Sleep paralysis occurs when a person is unable to move their body while falling asleep or waking up. It is often accompanied by vivid hallucinations and a feeling of being trapped. While physical activity like running could potentially jolt the body out of paralysis, it is unlikely that Freddy would be able to move his body in such a state. On the other hand, focusing on waking oneself up is a common technique used to overcome sleep paralysis. By concentrating on moving a specific body part or repeating a mantra, Freddy may have been able to regain control of his body and end the episode of paralysis. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tim was coloring at home. Which event could cause Tim spent the next day painting the way white?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim painted on the walls and floor. (B) Tim was so careful at coloring that his dad led him help paint the walkway.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Tim painted on the walls and floor, it would be more likely that he would need to spend the next day painting over the mess he made. Option B suggests that Tim was careful while coloring, so it is less likely that he would need to spend the next day painting over something he did wrong."}}
{"Q": "Gina entered her classroom and went to her desk. Which event could cause The fact that Tami was still talking to them made Gina uncomfortable?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tami had asked Gina not to talk with the gossip girls. (B) She started talking to some friends, but a bully named Tami butted in.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Tami, a bully, interrupted Gina's conversation with her friends, making her uncomfortable, rather than Tami asking Gina not to talk with the gossip girls. The latter scenario does not necessarily explain why Tami's presence would make Gina uncomfortable."}}
{"Q": "Sam went door to door to try to sell magazines. Which event could cause The old man waved Sam off and told him to go?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam tried to persuade an old man to purchase. (B) Sam knocked on an old man,.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The old man waving Sam off and telling him to go is a response to Sam trying to persuade him to purchase magazines. If Sam had simply knocked on the old man's door without trying to sell him anything, it would be unlikely for the old man to react in such a negative way."}}
{"Q": "Mary-Anne was feeling lonely and decided to adopt a cat. Which event could cause She decided it was not the right cat?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cat tore up her new couch. (B) Mary-Anne was very mean to the cat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The cat tore up her new couch.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Mary-Anne would decide not to keep the cat if it caused damage to her belongings, rather than her being mean to the cat. It is important to note that adopting a pet is a serious commitment and should not be taken lightly. It is important to consider all factors before making a decision to adopt a pet."}}
{"Q": "Ralph was a working dog. Which event could cause They weren't angry anymore when the bomb exploded up ahead?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ralph's owners were angry when he was making a lot of friends. (B) Ralph searched for the bomb restless, but couldn't find.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Since Ralph was a working dog, it is more likely that he was trained to search for bombs. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible event that could cause the statement \"They weren't angry anymore when the bomb exploded up ahead.\" It suggests that Ralph was doing his job to search for the bomb, but unfortunately, he couldn't find it in time, which led to the explosion."}}
{"Q": "Shannon had been coughing every morning for weeks. Which event could cause After three weeks of electronic cigarettes, her cough subsided?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Shannon was smoking cigarettes a lot. (B) Shannon had quit smoking e-cigs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Shannon had quit smoking e-cigs.\nExplanation: Electronic cigarettes are known to cause respiratory issues, including coughing. Quitting e-cigs could have led to the improvement in Shannon's cough. Smoking cigarettes a lot (option A) would have likely worsened her cough, not improved it."}}
{"Q": "Kelly and her friends went to a new ice cream shop. Which event could cause Kelly was glad she tried new flavors?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly's friends convinced her to stay with her usual flavor. (B) Kelly decided to get something other than her usual flavor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Kelly decided to get something other than her usual flavor, it means she was willing to try new flavors. Therefore, if she enjoyed the new flavor, she would be glad she tried it. On the other hand, if her friends convinced her to stay with her usual flavor, she would not have tried anything new and would not have the opportunity to discover new flavors that she might like."}}
{"Q": "Joe was helping his dad clear the woods in the back of their yard. Which event could cause Joe was angry he got hurt?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe fell over a log and laughed about it. (B) Joe fell over a log and hurt himself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe would be angry if he got hurt while clearing the woods with his dad. Falling over a log and hurting himself would likely cause frustration and anger, whereas laughing about it would not."}}
{"Q": "Kelly and her friends went to a new ice cream shop. Which event could cause She threw up?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kelly tried blueberry without knowing she was allergic to the dye. (B) Kelly tried a new flavor and loved it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Kelly was allergic to the blueberry dye and didn't know it, consuming it could cause an allergic reaction and vomiting. Trying a new flavor and loving it would not cause vomiting."}}
{"Q": "Mary had been dying to see her favorite band. Which event could cause When they got there, Mary realized she left the tickets at home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mary was very excited. (B) Mary was very nervous.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Mary was very excited.\nExplanation: Mary's excitement about seeing her favorite band would make it more likely that she would forget something important like the tickets. When people are excited, they tend to be more forgetful and may overlook important details. On the other hand, if Mary was very nervous, she would be more likely to double-check everything and make sure she had the tickets with her."}}
{"Q": "I loved smoked salmon. Which event could cause I contracted a bacterial infection from the smoked salmon?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I bought some smoked salmon from a very sketchy seller. (B) I didn't know how to cook it though and cooked it too long.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Consuming smoked salmon from a sketchy seller can increase the risk of bacterial infection, such as Listeria or Salmonella. Cooking the salmon too long may affect the taste and texture, but it is unlikely to cause a bacterial infection."}}
{"Q": "Han liked nature. Which event could cause And Han enjoyed watering and taking care of his neighbor's plants?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Han's neighbor hired him as a window washer. (B) he often loved walking through the forest near the park and going on walking trails.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) he often loved walking through the forest near the park and going on walking trails.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because it directly relates to Han's love for nature. Enjoying walking through the forest and going on walking trails would likely lead to an appreciation for plants and their care. On the other hand, being hired as a window washer does not necessarily have any connection to enjoying nature or plant care."}}
{"Q": "When I was sixteen I learned to drive. Which event could cause My dad then took me to get my license?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) My Mother taught me all the finer points. (B) I slept for weeks before my driver's test.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. My Mother taught me all the finer points.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that after learning to drive with his mother, the father took him to get his license. It is unlikely that sleeping for weeks before the driver's test would be the cause for the father taking him to get his license."}}
{"Q": "Ky was a little chubby and wanted to lose 20 pounds before summer. Which event could cause And by summer, she had lost the other ten?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She started exercising and lost 10 lbs in a few eeeks. (B) Ky gained 20 pounds and now aimed for 30.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Ky started exercising and lost 10 lbs in a few weeks, it is plausible that she could continue to lose another 10 lbs by summer with consistent effort and a healthy diet. On the other hand, option (B) is not a plausible answer as it goes against Ky's initial goal of losing weight and does not provide a realistic scenario for her to lose the additional 10 lbs by summer."}}
{"Q": "Jake was biking at the park. Which event could cause He put his dirty clothes into a plastic bag?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) While biking Jake got very sweaty. (B) He biked through some mud puddles.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He biked through some mud puddles.\nExplanation: Biking through mud puddles would likely cause Jake's clothes to get dirty, whereas simply getting sweaty may not necessarily result in dirty clothes. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible event that could cause Jake to put his dirty clothes into a plastic bag."}}
{"Q": "Joe needed a new desk. Which event could cause Joe regretted his decision when the desk broke after two days?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Joe went to the goodwill to get him a new desk. (B) Joe went to the store to buy a new desk.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Joe went to the store to buy a new desk, he likely spent more money and had higher expectations for the quality of the desk. If it broke after only two days, he would likely regret his decision to purchase it from that particular store or brand. If he went to the goodwill, he may have had lower expectations for the desk and may not have been as disappointed if it broke."}}
{"Q": "Joe was having a terrible time camping. Which event could cause But he couldn't find his car keys?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe wanted to stay. (B) Joe had a flat tire in the wild.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Joe had a flat tire in the wild.\nExplanation: While losing car keys can be a frustrating experience, it is not necessarily a reason for Joe to have a terrible time camping. On the other hand, having a flat tire in the wild can be a much more challenging and stressful situation, especially if Joe is not prepared to fix it or does not have a spare tire. This could lead to a terrible camping experience for Joe."}}
{"Q": "Laura decided to fly all the way to New York City. Which event could cause Laura wore a hat all week to hide her hair?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Laura cut her hair by mistake. (B) When Laura got there she realized she forgot shampoo.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) When Laura got there she realized she forgot shampoo.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Laura would wear a hat all week to hide her hair if she forgot to bring shampoo and her hair became greasy and unmanageable. Cutting her hair by mistake would not necessarily require her to wear a hat all week, as she could simply style it differently or wear it up."}}
{"Q": "Nate began writing stories for a few cents. Which event could cause He was just writing to help scientific research?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He was getting paid close to nothing. (B) Nate was found by a researcher who paid him well.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Nate was found by a researcher who paid him well.\nExplanation: If Nate was just writing to help scientific research, it is more likely that he would continue to do so even if he was not getting paid much. Therefore, option (A) is less plausible. Option (B) suggests that Nate was able to continue writing for scientific research, but was paid well for his work, which would be a more likely reason for him to continue writing."}}
{"Q": "I adopted a puppy. Which event could cause The carrots worked perfectly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I fed the puppy cooked beets. (B) I needed something for him to chew on.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I needed something for him to chew on.\nExplanation: The statement \"The carrots worked perfectly\" implies that the puppy enjoyed chewing on the carrots. Therefore, it is more plausible that the reason for the success of the carrots is that the puppy needed something to chew on, rather than the unrelated event of feeding him cooked beets."}}
{"Q": "We went on our first diving trip on Tuesday. Which event could cause We decided we went on our last diving trip on Tuesday?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) We were almost eaten by a shark. (B) We have never had a better time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) We were almost eaten by a shark.\nExplanation: If the divers had a close encounter with a shark and felt that their safety was at risk, it could cause them to decide not to go on another diving trip in the future. This would be a more plausible reason for not wanting to go on another diving trip than simply having had a great time on their first trip."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy grew up very poor. Which event could cause Jimmy called his parents and cursed at them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) So he dropped out of school. And left home. (B) So he dropped out of the sky. And left home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. So he dropped out of school and left home.\nExplanation: Dropping out of school and leaving home could be a very stressful and emotional experience for Jimmy, especially if he grew up in poverty. It is possible that he may feel angry and frustrated with his parents for not being able to provide him with the support he needed to stay in school and succeed. This could lead him to lash out and curse at them. On the other hand, dropping out of the sky is not a realistic event and would not be a plausible reason for Jimmy to curse at his parents."}}
{"Q": "Sam's neck had been hurting recently. Which event could cause His neck no longer hurt with the added support?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam got a neck brace from his father. (B) Sam purchase a neck brace to increase pain.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Sam got a neck brace from his father.\nExplanation: A neck brace is designed to provide support and immobilization to the neck, which can help alleviate pain and promote healing. Therefore, it is more plausible that Sam's neck pain would improve with the added support of a neck brace, especially if it was prescribed or recommended by a medical professional. On the other hand, purchasing a neck brace to increase pain does not make sense and is unlikely to provide any relief."}}
{"Q": "Our friend owns a restaurant. Which event could cause The employee was not impressed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Our friend kept the restaurant open after hours. (B) Our friend tried to impress the employees with a free meal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Our friend kept the restaurant open after hours.\nExplanation: Keeping the restaurant open after hours could cause the employee to be not impressed as it could disrupt their work-life balance and affect their personal plans. It could also lead to overworking and exhaustion, which could negatively impact their job satisfaction. On the other hand, offering a free meal could be seen as a positive gesture and could potentially impress the employee."}}
{"Q": "Elle's chorus was having a bake sale to raise money for new robes. Which event could cause The chorus had raised nearly half of what they needed in one day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Elle made lots of cookies to give away free. (B) Elles chorus really wanted new robes.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Elle made lots of cookies to give away free.\nExplanation: If Elle made lots of cookies to give away free, it would attract more customers to the bake sale and increase sales. This could result in the chorus raising nearly half of what they needed in one day. While it is true that the chorus really wanted new robes (option B), it does not explain how they were able to raise nearly half of what they needed in one day."}}
{"Q": "Jim is shocked when he gets an amazing deal on a house. Which event could cause Jim withdraws his offer and fires his real estate agent?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The house is full of moldy cheese. (B) he was being told a lie about the damage and forclouser.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jim finds out that he was being lied to about the condition and foreclosure status of the house, it would be a valid reason for him to withdraw his offer and fire his real estate agent. This is because he would have lost trust in the agent and may not want to continue working with them. On the other hand, the scenario of the house being full of moldy cheese seems unlikely and unrealistic, making it an implausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Amy loved salad. Which event could cause Amy loved the salad so much she returned with friends?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) She tried a Thai salad at a new restaurant. (B) Salad went to a store to get Amy.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She tried a Thai salad at a new restaurant.\nExplanation: Trying a new type of salad at a new restaurant and enjoying it enough to want to share it with friends is a plausible reason for Amy to return with friends. On the other hand, the second option of Salad going to a store to get Amy is not a logical event and does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Fred is looking for ways to make his apartment feel more comfortable. Which event could cause He feels happy that he has improved how his apartment feels?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He was thinking of selling cheap furniture and decorating it but then done in a trashy way. (B) Fred went to the store to get some new pictures.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Going to the store to get new pictures is a plausible event that could lead to Fred feeling happy about improving the comfort of his apartment. Adding new decorations can make a space feel more personalized and cozy, which could improve Fred's overall satisfaction with his living situation. Selling cheap furniture and decorating in a trashy way is not likely to make Fred feel happy about his apartment's comfort level."}}
{"Q": "Neil was touring haunted cities. Which event could cause He definitely thought Erie was haunted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Neil thought he met an interesting person in Erie, PA. (B) He didn't believe in ghosts till he saw one in Erie.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The event that could cause Neil to definitely think Erie was haunted is seeing a ghost. Option A mentions meeting an interesting person, which is not related to the haunting of the city. However, option B directly relates to the belief in ghosts and seeing one in Erie would confirm the haunting for Neil."}}
{"Q": "Jim had a dog whom he loved very much. Which event could cause At last she was clean, and he promised never to let her be hurt again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim's dog ran into the backyard and had tons of fun. (B) One day, Jim's dog ran ahead during a walk and got stuck in a mud pit.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) One day, Jim's dog ran ahead during a walk and got stuck in a mud pit.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it involves the dog getting dirty and potentially hurt. Jim's promise to never let her be hurt again suggests that the dog was in some sort of danger or distress. Running into the backyard and having fun does not necessarily lead to the need for a promise to protect the dog from harm."}}
{"Q": "Jill was a very fashion conscious young girl. Which event could cause The drawing was so good, she was able to make a pattern out of it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jill showed her mom a picture of a dress she drew. (B) Jill drew something of a design.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jill drew something of a design, it is more likely that she could make a pattern out of it. Drawing a picture of a dress may not necessarily result in a design that can be turned into a pattern."}}
{"Q": "One day Jordan had a friend over so they could play video games. Which event could cause Now when Jordan has a friend over, he makes sure they both play?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jordan's friend got bored when Jordan kept playing alone. (B) Jordan's friend wanted to take turns.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Jordan's friend got bored when Jordan kept playing alone, it would make sense for Jordan to make sure they both play when he has a friend over in the future. It shows that Jordan learned from the previous experience and wants to make sure his friend has a good time playing video games with him. Option (B) is also a possibility, but it is not as strong of an explanation as (A)."}}
{"Q": "Neil was visiting Romania. Which event could cause Neil decided to never return to Transylvania?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Neil's hotel was very dirty and unfriendly. (B) Neil lost his luggage in Kansas.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Neil's hotel being dirty and unfriendly would be a more plausible reason for him to not want to return to Transylvania. Losing his luggage in Kansas would not be directly related to his experience in Romania and would not necessarily impact his decision to return to Transylvania."}}
{"Q": "A man went out early one morning. Which event could cause He resolved, next time, to check the day's overall forecast?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It started raining on the man. (B) It started raining and she didn't have an umbrella.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. It started raining on the man.\nExplanation: If it started raining on the man, he may have been caught off guard and unprepared for the weather. This could lead him to resolve to check the day's overall forecast in the future to avoid being caught in the rain again. Option B mentions \"she\" which is not consistent with the given information about the man. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Joe went to the restaurant for wings. Which event could cause Joe got to finally enjoy his wings?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Joe ordered his favorite sushi at the restaurant. (B) Joe got lost on the way to the restaurant and it took him really long to find it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Joe finally got his wings because he ordered them at the restaurant.\nExplanation: Option A is not a plausible answer because Joe ordered his favorite sushi, not wings. Option B is also not a plausible answer because getting lost on the way to the restaurant would delay Joe's enjoyment of his wings, but it wouldn't prevent him from eventually getting them. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Joe finally got to enjoy his wings because he ordered them at the restaurant."}}
{"Q": "Emily had a paper due for class. Which event could cause The next day, Emily's paper was not done?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Emily planned to pull an all-nighter but fell asleep. (B) Emily refused to go to a party and instead worked on it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: While it is possible that Emily could have chosen to work on her paper instead of going to a party, it is more likely that she planned to stay up all night to finish it but fell asleep. This is a common scenario for students who procrastinate and underestimate the amount of time and effort needed to complete an assignment."}}
{"Q": "Tim had a problem. Which event could cause He was so amazed at the sight that he was no longer scared?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim then got headphones to help with his hearing. (B) Tim was scared to go to the new school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is a more plausible answer because it suggests that Tim was scared before and the sight he saw at the new school helped him overcome his fear. Option A, on the other hand, is not related to the situation and does not explain why Tim was no longer scared."}}
{"Q": "Nina was at the skating rink. Which event could cause Luckily, the girl left?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A teacher from Nina's school was also at the rink. (B) Her biggest rival tried to start a fight.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Her biggest rival tried to start a fight.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause Nina to leave the skating rink because it involves a potential physical altercation with someone she has a conflict with. Seeing a teacher from her school at the rink may not necessarily cause her to leave, especially if they have a good relationship."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy needed a new pair of pants. Which event could cause Jimmy bought the pants he wanted?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jimmy had a jar of coins he saved for years. (B) Jimmy decided to make himself a pair of pants.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jimmy had a jar of coins he saved for years.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Jimmy would buy the pants he wanted with money he had saved up rather than making them himself. Making pants requires a certain level of skill and materials, which may not be readily available to Jimmy. On the other hand, it is common for people to save up money for things they want or need, such as a new pair of pants."}}
{"Q": "Nancy was looking for a place to eat. Which event could cause They looked at her with a mean grin?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The only available table was full of Nancy's enemies. (B) She walked up to a local library where many girls were eating.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The event that could cause them to look at her with a mean grin is that the only available table was full of Nancy's enemies. This would make sense as her enemies would likely be happy to see her in an uncomfortable situation and may even taunt or mock her. Walking up to a local library where many girls were eating does not necessarily imply any negative or hostile behavior towards Nancy, so it is less plausible."}}
{"Q": "Andy always helped his Dad plant trees. Which event could cause The tree reminds Andy of his Dad?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Andy planted a tree. (B) Andy's dad never passed away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Andy planted a tree.\nExplanation: Since Andy always helped his Dad plant trees, it is more likely that he would associate the trees with his Dad if he had planted one himself. The act of planting a tree would have a personal connection to his memories of working with his Dad, making it a more plausible event to trigger the memory. The fact that Andy's Dad never passed away (option B) does not necessarily have a direct connection to the memory of the tree reminding him of his Dad."}}
{"Q": "Tina and Mark were looking for a new house. Which event could cause I feel sorry for the builder they hired?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They decided to have it built to random specifications. (B) Tina and Mark had many wild ideas, so the decided to build a house.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Tina and Mark decided to have their house built to random specifications, it would be difficult for the builder to meet their expectations and could lead to frustration and dissatisfaction on both sides. This could cause the builder to feel sorry for taking on the project. On the other hand, having many wild ideas is not necessarily a bad thing and could actually be exciting for the builder to work on."}}
{"Q": "Tim had a pet frog. Which event could cause Tim buried his frog that day?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim's frog got eaten by a dog. (B) Unfortunately Tim's frog passed away.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Unfortunately Tim's frog passed away.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because it is common for pets to pass away due to natural causes or illness. It is unlikely for a dog to eat a pet frog, as frogs are not a typical prey for dogs."}}
{"Q": "Chad's stomach began to rumble. Which event could cause Chad ate it all and got sick?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Chad ate a funny-tasting insect. (B) He had only just started eating his food.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Chad ate a funny-tasting insect and got sick, as insects can carry harmful bacteria or toxins that can cause illness. It is less likely that he got sick from eating all his food, especially if he had only just started eating it."}}
{"Q": "Briana was at the lake with her friend's family. Which event could cause Luckily, the next day they found cell service nearby?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Briana couldn't call anyone. (B) None of the family had a phone charger.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Briana couldn't call anyone.\nExplanation: If Briana couldn't call anyone, it would make sense that they would be relieved to find cell service nearby the next day. On the other hand, the fact that none of the family had a phone charger wouldn't necessarily lead to the need for cell service."}}
{"Q": "My parents enjoy going to the casino. Which event could cause Ever since I leave the gambling to my parents?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I lost lots of money gambling. (B) I went with them many times and won $100.00.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) I lost lots of money gambling.\nExplanation: If the speaker lost a significant amount of money while gambling, they may have realized the negative consequences and decided to leave the gambling to their parents. This experience could have been a turning point for the speaker and made them more cautious about gambling in the future. On the other hand, winning $100.00 (option B) may not have been enough to deter the speaker from gambling and may have even encouraged them to continue."}}
{"Q": "A friend and I were walking through a wooded area. Which event could cause I threw it back down and we ran away?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I picked up a rock with hieroglyphics on it. (B) We picked up a snake because we thought it was a stick.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) We picked up a snake because we thought it was a stick.\nExplanation: This is a more plausible answer because picking up a snake, especially if you thought it was a stick, could cause a sudden and fearful reaction. It is a common instinct to throw something down and run away when encountering a snake, especially if you are not familiar with the species and whether or not it is venomous. On the other hand, finding a rock with hieroglyphics on it may be interesting or curious, but it is unlikely to cause a sudden and fearful reaction."}}
{"Q": "Michael ordered a pepperoni pizza. Which event could cause While on the phone, his wife said that he opened the box backwards?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Michael accepted the pizza but it never arrived. (B) Michael accepted the pizza when it arrived.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Michael accepted the pizza when it arrived.\nExplanation: If Michael accepted the pizza when it arrived, it is possible that he opened the box backwards while on the phone with his wife. This event is plausible because it is a simple mistake that can happen while distracted on the phone. Option (A) is not a plausible answer because if the pizza never arrived, Michael would not have been able to open the box at all."}}
{"Q": "Jimmy grew up very poor. Which event could cause So he repaid them for college?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A family offered Jimmy to pay his tuition. (B) He took out a loan for school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. A family offered Jimmy to pay his tuition.\nExplanation: Given that Jimmy grew up very poor, it is more plausible that he did not have the financial means to take out a loan for school. Therefore, it is more likely that a family offered to pay his tuition, which he later repaid as a gesture of gratitude."}}
{"Q": "Will was driving to his college. Which event could cause The person threw food and trash at Will's car?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Will stopped and picked up a hitchhiker. (B) Will double parked at his college.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Will double parked at his college.\nExplanation: Double parking can be a frustrating experience for other drivers who are trying to find a parking spot. It is possible that someone became angry with Will for double parking and decided to throw food and trash at his car as a form of retaliation. On the other hand, picking up a hitchhiker does not seem like a plausible reason for someone to throw food and trash at Will's car."}}
{"Q": "A caterpillar was crawling along a wall. Which event could cause He placed the caterpillar on a nearby tree?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A man found the caterpillar. (B) He wanted to kill the caterpillar.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A man found the caterpillar.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a man found the caterpillar and decided to place it on a nearby tree to ensure its safety and well-being, rather than wanting to kill it. Placing the caterpillar on a tree would provide it with a natural habitat and food source, which would be beneficial for its growth and development."}}
{"Q": "I drove my motorcycle across the street. Which event could cause I cleaned my motorcycle after I got home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The tree i parked under dripped sap on it. (B) I drove my motorcycle through the car wash, splashing soap all over my motorcycle.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that the tree under which the motorcycle was parked dripped sap on it, as this is a common occurrence and can cause damage to the motorcycle's paint and finish. Driving through a car wash and splashing soap all over the motorcycle is less likely, as it requires a deliberate action and may not be necessary after a short trip across the street."}}
{"Q": "Kim got a bike for her birthday. Which event could cause To her horror her bike was gone and the chain was on the gate?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kim locked her bike to the gate with a chain and watched it. (B) Kim forgot to lock her new bike up to a gate at school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Kim forgot to lock her new bike up to a gate at school.\nExplanation: This scenario is more plausible because Kim may have been careless and forgot to lock her bike up, making it an easy target for theft. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Kim would lock her bike up and watch it, only to have it stolen anyway."}}
{"Q": "I found my old yearbook today while cleaning. Which event could cause The day was almost over and I hadn't cleaned anything?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I became lost in a huge world of fond memories. (B) I kept looking through things to see what else I could find while I cleaned.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) I became lost in a huge world of fond memories.\nExplanation: While looking through the yearbook, the person may have become engrossed in reminiscing about old times and lost track of time, causing them to realize that the day was almost over and they hadn't cleaned anything. This is a more plausible answer as it relates directly to the discovery of the yearbook and the emotional attachment one may have to it. Choice (B) is less likely as it suggests the person was intentionally procrastinating and not actually cleaning."}}
{"Q": "Michelle had a huge stack of books. Which event could cause Then she went home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Michelle organized the books in her room. (B) She decided to donate them to the library.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Michelle organized the books in her room.\nExplanation: If Michelle had a huge stack of books, it is likely that she needed to organize them in her room. This is a common reason for someone to go home after having a large amount of books. Donating them to the library would not necessarily require her to go home immediately."}}
{"Q": "Kelly decided to have a golf tournament with her friend. Which event could cause Kelly couldn't wait to beat her again?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kelly scored much higher than her friend on the SAT. (B) Kelly lead the entire competition.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Kelly lead the entire competition.\nExplanation: Since the event in question is a golf tournament, it is more likely that Kelly would be excited to beat her friend again if she had previously won or performed better in the tournament. Option (A) is unrelated to the golf tournament and therefore unlikely to be the cause of Kelly's excitement."}}
{"Q": "Harry was making some spaghetti. Which event could cause A few minutes later they saw that the colander had melted?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Harry used a metal colander. (B) Henry failed at it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Harry used a metal colander, it could have melted due to the high heat of the boiling water. This is a more plausible explanation than Henry failing at it, as it is unlikely that a person could fail at using a colander in a way that would cause it to melt."}}
{"Q": "Gina had a crush on Jamie and Josh. Which event could cause Gina wasn't sure if it was good advice, or sabotage?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gina's friend said she should talk to both. (B) Gina's friend told her to tell them both the combination at the same time, and let them fight over her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is more likely to cause Gina to question whether her friend's advice is good or not because it involves pitting Jamie and Josh against each other, which could potentially damage their friendship and cause drama. Option A is a more common and harmless suggestion, so it is less likely to cause Gina to doubt her friend's intentions."}}
{"Q": "Jason was the second string quarterback at his school. Which event could cause The coach decided to replace the star quarterback with Jason?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jason made a great play. (B) Jason made a terrible play.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Jason made a great play, it would show the coach that he has the potential to perform well under pressure and could be a better fit for the team's needs. On the other hand, if Jason made a terrible play, it would not make sense for the coach to replace the star quarterback with someone who is not performing well."}}
{"Q": "I only intended to work at my aunt's dentistry office for a summer. Which event could cause Now I am a dentist working in her office?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Instead, it became my kryptonite. (B) I fell in love with the field over time.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I fell in love with the field over time.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the person developed an interest in dentistry and decided to pursue it as a career after working at their aunt's office for a summer. This is a common occurrence where people discover their passion for a field while working in it. Option (A) is less likely as it suggests that working at the dentistry office had a negative impact on the person's life."}}
{"Q": "Mitch wanted to learn how to play the piano. Which event could cause After 3 months, Mitch was able to afford his piano lessons?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Mitch took a part time job after school. (B) Mitch took a piano lessons after school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Mitch took a part time job after school.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Mitch was able to afford his piano lessons after 3 months because he took a part time job after school. Piano lessons can be expensive, and it would take a significant amount of time to save up enough money to pay for them without a steady source of income. Taking a part time job would provide Mitch with the means to pay for his lessons and achieve his goal of learning how to play the piano."}}
{"Q": "Gina's family stopped for gas on a road trip. Which event could cause She exited the car, and walked across the cold parking lot?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she decided to stretch her legs and get some fresh air. (B) Gina finally arrived at home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Gina exited the car and walked across the cold parking lot because she wanted to stretch her legs and get some fresh air, especially during a long road trip. It is unlikely that she would do this upon arriving home."}}
{"Q": "Neil was visiting Romania. Which event could cause Neil enjoyed visiting Transylvania?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Neil didn't want to go to Transylvania. (B) The hotel and its staff where the extremely friendly and help.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (C) Neil is interested in the history and folklore of Dracula and vampires.\nExplanation: Transylvania is known for its association with the legend of Dracula and vampires, which may have piqued Neil's interest. Therefore, it is more plausible that Neil enjoyed visiting Transylvania because of his interest in the history and folklore of the region."}}
{"Q": "Jim was extremely bored on Sunday. Which event could cause He decided to got to the Star Trek convention?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jim read about a Star Wars convention. (B) He had heard about some local events.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He had heard about some local events.\nExplanation: Option B is more plausible because Jim was bored on Sunday and looking for something to do. It is more likely that he heard about some local events, including the Star Trek convention, rather than randomly stumbling upon information about a Star Wars convention. Additionally, the fact that the event was local makes it more accessible and convenient for Jim to attend."}}
{"Q": "Louise had a pop quiz in science class. Which event could cause She got a bad grade on it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Louise did not have time to study. (B) Louise studied the night before.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Louise did not have time to study.\nExplanation: If Louise did not have time to study, she would not have been adequately prepared for the pop quiz, which could have resulted in a bad grade. Even if she studied the night before, if she did not have enough time to review the material thoroughly, she may not have done well on the quiz."}}
{"Q": "My son was a painter. Which event could cause My son was happy and our relationship grew stronger?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I told my artist I supported his dream of becoming a professional son. (B) My son painted the house for free.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I told my artist I supported his dream of becoming a professional son.\nExplanation: This event shows that the parent is supportive of their child's career aspirations, which can lead to increased happiness and a stronger relationship between them. It also suggests that the son may feel more confident and validated in pursuing his passion for painting. On the other hand, while painting the house for free may be a kind gesture, it does not necessarily have a direct impact on the son's happiness or the parent-child relationship."}}
{"Q": "Maria went swimming into in the ocean. Which event could cause Neal dived in the water to get her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She got swept away by a small current. (B) Maria went in too far and needed help.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: Maria getting swept away by a small current is a more plausible reason for Neal to dive in and get her because it is a common occurrence in the ocean and can happen quickly without warning. Going in too far and needing help is also a possibility, but it is less likely to require immediate action from someone else."}}
{"Q": "Karen, Ashley, and Beth were very excited. Which event could cause When Mommy came home, she was sure to be very surprised?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Karen, Ashley, and Beth had refused to clean up the house for their mom. (B) Karen, Ashley, and Beth made their mom a cake.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Karen, Ashley, and Beth made their mom a cake.\nExplanation: Making a cake for their mom is a positive and thoughtful gesture that would likely surprise and please her. Refusing to clean up the house would not be a pleasant surprise for their mom."}}
{"Q": "When I was sixteen I learned to drive. Which event could cause After that mistake, I became much more cautious?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I wasn't paying attention and I got into an accident. (B) I stopped a red light, but got into a car accident.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: Getting into an accident while driving is a common experience that can cause someone to become more cautious. In this scenario, the fact that the person wasn't paying attention suggests that they may have been driving recklessly or distractedly, leading to the accident and prompting them to be more careful in the future. Option B suggests that the person was following traffic laws by stopping at a red light, but still got into an accident, which is less likely to cause a significant change in driving behavior."}}
{"Q": "Amanda recently took a trip to the zoo. Which event could cause Amanda really enjoyed the zoo, but she will never forget the anaconda?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) The anaconda was 400 feet long. (B) Amanda saw everything there.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) The anaconda was 400 feet long.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is a unique and memorable experience. Seeing an anaconda that is 400 feet long would be a rare and impressive sight, and it is likely that Amanda would remember it for a long time. On the other hand, simply seeing everything at the zoo is not as memorable or significant."}}
{"Q": "Gina's friends all had Lisa Frank Trapper Keepers. Which event could cause She didn't want to ruin the design, so she didn't use the pencils?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Her enemies all colored on their Trapper Keepers. (B) After school, Gina's dad surprised her with one, too.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) After school, Gina's dad surprised her with one, too.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it provides a logical reason for Gina to not want to ruin the design on her Trapper Keeper. If she just received it as a gift, she may want to keep it in pristine condition for as long as possible. On the other hand, if her enemies colored on their Trapper Keepers, it wouldn't necessarily affect Gina's desire to use her own pencils."}}
{"Q": "Randy was very shy and never talked much at school. Which event could cause Frank and Randy became good friends through their shyness?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Frank was also very shy. (B) One day Randy met Frank who was deaf too.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Frank was also very shy.\nExplanation: It is more likely that two shy individuals would bond over their shared trait of shyness. Meeting someone who is deaf may not necessarily lead to a friendship based on shyness alone."}}
{"Q": "Jennifer was trying to get some lunch. Which event could cause Unfortunately, almost everything was already gone?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jennifer was the first person at the food truck. (B) She was running late from class.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) She was running late from class.\nExplanation: If Jennifer was running late from class, it is more likely that other people had already gotten to the food truck before her and had already purchased most of the available food. If she was the first person at the food truck (choice A), there would have been plenty of food available for her to choose from."}}
{"Q": "Kathy was driving her car on the highway. Which event could cause She wondered after that if it was worth swerving in the first place?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She wasn't able to avoid hitting the car. (B) The next car hit and killed the animal Kathy avoided.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The next car hit and killed the animal Kathy avoided.\nExplanation: This event could cause Kathy to wonder if it was worth swerving in the first place because she may have put herself in danger by swerving to avoid the animal, and the animal still ended up getting hit by another car. She may question if it was worth risking her own safety to avoid hitting the animal if it ultimately didn't make a difference in saving its life."}}
{"Q": "Sam couldn't wait to show off his science fair project at school. Which event could cause They were a very attentive audience?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He made a presentation. (B) Sam was too nervous to tell the audience about his project.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. He made a presentation.\nExplanation: If Sam made a presentation, it implies that he had the opportunity to explain his project to the audience. If he did a good job presenting, the audience would have been attentive and interested in what he had to say. On the other hand, if Sam was too nervous to tell the audience about his project, it is unlikely that the audience would have been very attentive."}}
{"Q": "Don was always moving slow. Which event could cause He never walked slowly again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Someone ran into Don from behind. (B) Don went to the doctor and got eye drops.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If someone ran into Don from behind, it could cause him to fall or injure himself, which could result in him never walking slowly again. On the other hand, getting eye drops from the doctor would not have any direct impact on Don's walking speed."}}
{"Q": "Dan was working diligently at his desk. Which event could cause He thanked her and was happy to have found his lost appliance?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan received a call from someone who found his dog that he lost on the way to work. (B) A lady approached Dan and asked if this was his PDA. It was.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Option B is the more plausible answer because it involves Dan finding a lost appliance, which is mentioned in the question. Option A involves Dan losing a dog, which is not mentioned in the question and is therefore less likely to be the cause of his gratitude and happiness. Additionally, finding a lost PDA is a more realistic scenario in a workplace setting than finding a lost dog."}}
{"Q": "When my daughter was 8 months old we put her into a walker. Which event could cause She cried for awhile but recovered quickly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I tipped the walker over when trying to walk. (B) Sometimes she would fall down.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Sometimes she would fall down.\nExplanation: It is more likely that the baby cried for a while but recovered quickly due to falling down while using the walker, as this is a common occurrence for babies learning to use walkers. Tipping the walker over while trying to walk could cause a more serious injury and would be less likely for the baby to recover quickly from."}}
{"Q": "Alex's phone got dropped in the toilet and died. Which event could cause Finally, she settled on the new iPhone and purchased it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) so she went to the mall to find a new one. (B) Alex searched the hay stack for a new phone.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Alex would go to a mall or electronics store to find a new phone rather than searching through a haystack. Additionally, the fact that her phone died in the toilet suggests that she would need a replacement quickly, making a trip to the mall a more practical option."}}
{"Q": "Jordan and Alex were on a camping trip. Which event could cause Then she bought them a new tent?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jordan and Alex's tent was hit and a hole was created. (B) Jordan had a new tent.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that there was a problem with their original tent, which prompted the purchase of a new one. Option B does not provide a reason for why a new tent was bought, and it seems unlikely that Jordan would have a spare tent on a camping trip."}}
{"Q": "Tim had just learned how to used the telephone at home. Which event could cause Tim already went back to playing with his toys as his mother returned?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim couldn't find the phone. (B) Tim's mom told him never to use the phone without her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Tim couldn't find the phone, he wouldn't have been able to use it and therefore wouldn't have had the opportunity to go back to playing with his toys. On the other hand, if Tim's mom told him never to use the phone without her, he would have been aware of this rule and would have waited for her to return before playing with his toys. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Kim's mother tricked her into eating deer meat. Which event could cause Kim continued to yell as her mother walked out of the room?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Kim gave her mother a huge kiss. (B) Kim hated eating animals.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Kim hated eating animals.\nExplanation: If Kim hated eating animals, then it would make sense for her to continue yelling after her mother tricked her into eating deer meat. This event would likely cause Kim to feel upset and betrayed, leading to her continued yelling as her mother walked out of the room. On the other hand, choice (A) of Kim giving her mother a huge kiss does not seem like a plausible reaction to being tricked into eating something she did not want to eat."}}
{"Q": "Tracy had a crush on a boy. Which event could cause Tracy became embarrassed because she looked silly in many of them?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The boy knew it, and looked up pictures of Tracy on her Facebook page. (B) The boy jerked off to tracy's pictures.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that the boy looked up pictures of Tracy on her Facebook page and saw embarrassing photos of her, causing her to feel embarrassed. It is not appropriate or respectful to assume that the boy would engage in inappropriate behavior like masturbating to Tracy's pictures."}}
{"Q": "Ted loves to go to the movies. Which event could cause Ted continues to watch several movies a week?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Watching movies gave Ted a lot of ideas of writing. (B) Ted have enough money to watch movies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Ted has enough money to watch movies, he can continue to watch several movies a week without any financial constraints. On the other hand, watching movies giving Ted ideas for writing may not necessarily lead to him watching several movies a week. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It was the summer break. Which event could cause It was the first time Gina had been to that part of town?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gina and her friends decided to explore an amusement park. (B) Gina and her friends decided to explore the city.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Gina and her friends decided to explore the city.\nExplanation: Exploring a city would be a more likely reason for someone to visit a new part of town for the first time, as opposed to just going to an amusement park. Additionally, the fact that it was summer break suggests that they had more free time to spend exploring the city."}}
{"Q": "Jack loves walking to the Marathon. Which event could cause Shortly after arriving, the rain stopped and they walked home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) It started raining while he was walking. (B) Jack had to walk in the sun.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) It started raining while he was walking.\nExplanation: If it started raining while Jack was walking to the Marathon, it would make sense that the rain stopped shortly after he arrived and he walked home. It would also explain why he didn't have to walk in the sun, as option (B) suggests. Therefore, option (A) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "I stopped my car at the traffic light. Which event could cause Alas, he crashed his car and I realized street racing is bad?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) A guy came next to me and stole his engine to race me. (B) Another car gave me a street racing signal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Another car giving a street racing signal is a more plausible event that could lead to the realization that street racing is bad. It is common for street racers to signal each other and engage in illegal racing, which could result in accidents and injuries. On the other hand, it is highly unlikely for someone to steal an engine from a parked car at a traffic light."}}
{"Q": "Early one morning I could hear my dogs. Which event could cause They almost knocked me over on the way out, just to chase a cat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Earl was barking at a squirrel. (B) There was an orange cat at the back door.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: The fact that the dogs almost knocked the speaker over to chase a cat suggests that the cat was the more likely cause of their excitement, rather than a squirrel. Additionally, the mention of an orange cat at the back door in choice B provides a specific detail that makes it a more believable scenario."}}
{"Q": "The pilot felt a shake in the plane. Which event could cause He tried to fix it but in the end he hand to eject?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The plane kept moving around. (B) The plane was at a standstill.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If the plane kept moving around, it could indicate turbulence or mechanical issues that could potentially lead to the need for the pilot to eject. If the plane was at a standstill, it is less likely that there would be a need for the pilot to eject."}}
{"Q": "Beth wanted to give her mom a great present for Christmas. Which event could cause She knitted her mom a warm homemade sweater for free?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Beth found a box of yarn while cleaning her attic. (B) Beth had money so she decided to make something.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: It is more plausible that Beth found a box of yarn while cleaning her attic and decided to use it to make a gift for her mom rather than having money and deciding to make something. Finding the yarn for free would also make the gift more meaningful and special."}}
{"Q": "Dan wanted to find the perfect gift for his mother's birthday. Which event could cause Dan yelled at his mom for being picky?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) had time to play. (B) He bought her a necklace and she did not like it.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He bought her a necklace and she did not like it.\nExplanation: This event could cause Dan to yell at his mom for being picky because he put effort into finding the perfect gift for her birthday, but she did not appreciate it and was being difficult to please. This could lead to frustration and a possible outburst from Dan. The other option, (A) had time to play, does not relate to the situation and is not a plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "It started to rainy when we got in the car. Which event could cause I rear ended the car in front of me?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Visibility was greatly reduced but I drove on anyway. (B) I saw out of the window with windshield wipers.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If visibility was greatly reduced due to the rain, it would be more likely that the driver would rear end the car in front of them if they continued to drive without adjusting their speed or following distance. Using windshield wipers would not necessarily prevent a rear-end collision if the driver did not adjust their driving behavior in response to the rain."}}
{"Q": "Jenna came home from school and found a box on the porch. Which event could cause Jenna immediately regretted her decision to open the box?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jenna was excited and opened the box. (B) Jenna found some graphic objects in the trash.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jenna found some graphic objects in the box, it could be something disturbing or inappropriate that she did not want to see. This could cause her to immediately regret her decision to open the box. On the other hand, if Jenna was excited to open the box, she would not regret her decision unless she found something unpleasant inside."}}
{"Q": "Ted loved rodents. Which event could cause The rat got out of it's cage, and it crawled into his parent's bed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ted tried to pet one, but was careless. (B) One night Ted left the rat's cage open on purpose.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Ted tried to pet the rat and was careless, it is possible that the rat could have escaped from his grasp and crawled into his parent's bed. Leaving the cage open on purpose seems less likely as it would be an irresponsible and intentional act."}}
{"Q": "Dan was hungry. Which event could cause Dan returned to the couch and watched a movie with his snack?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Dan went to the kitchen and got a glass of water. (B) Dan made some popcorn.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Dan made some popcorn.\nExplanation: Since Dan was hungry, it is more plausible that he would make a snack like popcorn rather than just getting a glass of water. Additionally, the fact that he returned to the couch and watched a movie suggests that he wanted a snack that he could enjoy while relaxing, which popcorn would be a good option for."}}
{"Q": "The cat chased the mouse across the empty warehouse. Which event could cause The mouse got away?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The cat tripped over its feet and hit its head on the floor. (B) far from home.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The cat tripped over its feet and hit its head on the floor.\nExplanation: If the cat tripped and hit its head, it would likely be stunned or injured, giving the mouse an opportunity to escape. Option B, the mouse being far from home, does not necessarily guarantee that it would get away from the cat."}}
{"Q": "Anna left her purse on the bus one evening. Which event could cause Anna was so happy, she hugged him eagerly?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Anna found a man's purse. (B) A man found Anna's purse.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. A man found Anna's purse.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Anna would be happy and grateful if someone found and returned her own purse, rather than her finding someone else's purse. Therefore, option B is the more likely event that would cause Anna to hug the person who found her purse."}}
{"Q": "Gina and her sister sat on the porch waiting for their dad. Which event could cause She gave him a quick hug and hopped in the car?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Their mom's boyfriend arrived first. (B) when their dad showed up they were excited.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) when their dad showed up they were excited.\nExplanation: This answer is more plausible because the sentence mentions that Gina and her sister were waiting for their dad, so it makes sense that they would be excited and give him a quick hug when he arrived. Option (A) about their mom's boyfriend arriving first is not mentioned in the sentence and seems unrelated to the events described."}}
{"Q": "Laura decided to fly all the way to New York City. Which event could cause The compliments she got made Laura think the trip was worth it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) She packed her old torn clothes. (B) Laura got many compliments while in NYC.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Laura would feel her trip was worth it if she received many compliments while in NYC, rather than if she packed her old torn clothes. Getting compliments would indicate that she had a positive experience and was well-received by others, which would likely make her feel good about her decision to take the trip. Packing old torn clothes would not have a significant impact on her overall experience or perception of the trip."}}
{"Q": "Trisha was excited about letting someone live in their house. Which event could cause Years later the guys still lives there and Trisha wonders can he move?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) They decided to shelter multiple college students. (B) The guys thought Trisha was only moving in short term.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Trisha had decided to shelter multiple college students, it would be unlikely that only one guy would still be living there years later. However, if the guy thought Trisha was only moving in short term, he may have assumed he could stay longer and Trisha may now be wondering if he has overstayed his welcome."}}
{"Q": "Edgar had just come home from the grocery store. Which event could cause Later, he went to the store and bought more eggs?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Edgar made cookies and cake. (B) Edgar dropped the bag with the meat on the floor.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Edgar dropped the bag with the meat on the floor.\nExplanation: If Edgar dropped the bag with the meat on the floor, it is possible that the eggs in the bag were also damaged or broken. Therefore, he may have needed to go back to the store to buy more eggs. Making cookies and cake does not necessarily require more eggs, and there is no indication in the question that Edgar planned to make them."}}
{"Q": "Keith wanted to be a photographer. Which event could cause He was so excited?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Keiths parents bought him a new camera for Christmas. (B) Keith got excited for his birthday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Keiths parents bought him a new camera for Christmas.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because receiving a new camera as a gift would directly relate to Keith's desire to become a photographer. It would provide him with the necessary equipment to pursue his passion and would likely cause excitement and motivation to start practicing and improving his skills. On the other hand, getting excited for his birthday is not necessarily related to his goal of becoming a photographer and may not have the same level of impact on his enthusiasm for the craft."}}
{"Q": "Yan was walking in public to a restaurant. Which event could cause He immediately realized that his zipper was wide open?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Yan noticed stared at his pants. (B) Everyone looked at him and started laughing.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Yan noticed people staring at his pants, he may have looked down and realized his zipper was open. However, it is unlikely that everyone would start laughing just because someone's zipper is open. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Lori's class was supposed to be dissecting frogs. Which event could cause She picked up a knife and started dissecting the frog?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lori's class didn't take dissection serious. (B) Lori's teacher confuse a frog on her desk with an instruction booklet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Lori's teacher made a mistake and placed a frog on her desk instead of an instruction booklet, leading Lori to start dissecting the frog with the knife. It is unlikely that Lori would have started dissecting the frog on her own without proper instruction and guidance from her teacher."}}
{"Q": "As a child, And always hated reptiles. Which event could cause Now, And loves reptiles and even owns a snake and pet lizard?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) And's class had a pet snake he learned to really fear reptiles. (B) They worked in a reptile pet store as an intern.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Working in a reptile pet store as an intern would expose And to reptiles on a regular basis and provide an opportunity to learn more about them. This could lead to a greater understanding and appreciation for these animals, ultimately leading to And owning a snake and pet lizard. While encountering a pet snake in class could cause fear, it is less likely to result in a complete change in attitude towards reptiles."}}
{"Q": "I was eating on my patio. Which event could cause So, I threw a butter knife at it and it flew away?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A bee landed on my food. (B) I tried to share my food with a bird.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more plausible that a bee landed on the food and the person threw the butter knife to scare it away. It is unlikely that a person would throw a butter knife at a bird just for trying to share their food."}}
{"Q": "The driver's lined up in the starting grid. Which event could cause They came across the line together, a photo finish?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Me and my friends ran separately. (B) The race was very even.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The race was very even.\nExplanation: If the race was very even, it means that the drivers were closely matched in terms of speed and skill. This could lead to a situation where they cross the finish line at almost the same time, resulting in a photo finish. On the other hand, choice (A) about running separately has no relevance to the scenario described in the question."}}
{"Q": "Timmy got a check in the mail for his birthday. Which event could cause They cashed his check and Timmy took his money home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Timmy went to the bank. (B) Timmy's check bounced.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Timmy went to the bank.\nExplanation: If Timmy received a check in the mail, the most plausible event that would allow him to cash the check and take his money home would be if he went to the bank to deposit or cash the check. Option B, Timmy's check bouncing, would not allow him to take his money home as the check would not be valid."}}
{"Q": "One day my teacher allowed us to dismiss 30 seconds before the bell. Which event could cause She pointed and laughed as I picked myself up off the floor?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I tried to run, but stumbled upon a backpack. (B) I ran past the teacher and almost tripped.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it involves the student stumbling upon a backpack, which could cause them to fall and the teacher to laugh. Option B only involves the student almost tripping, which may not be as humorous to the teacher."}}
{"Q": "As a child, Andy had many toys. Which event could cause As an adult, Andy opened a toy museum and shared his love with others?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He loved throwing away all different types. (B) Andy continued to love toys as he got older.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Andy continued to love toys as he got older.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Andy's love for toys continued into adulthood and inspired him to open a toy museum to share his passion with others. If he had loved throwing away toys as a child, it is unlikely that he would have developed a love for them later in life."}}
{"Q": "Gary tripped on a football player's shoe. Which event could cause Gary ended up with a bruised face?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Gary almost landed hard and face first. (B) Gary got hit by the football player.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Gary tripped on the football player's shoe, it is more likely that he almost landed hard and face first, causing a bruised face. It is less likely that he got hit by the football player, as this would require a separate action from the initial tripping incident."}}
{"Q": "Amy and Ben had been together for one month. Which event could cause He gave her chocolates, she gave him skittles?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They decided to give each other money. (B) The exchanged gifts on their anniversary.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) The exchanged gifts on their anniversary.\nExplanation: Since they had only been together for one month, it is unlikely that they would have already decided to give each other money. On the other hand, exchanging gifts on their one-month anniversary is a common practice in new relationships, and it is plausible that Amy gave Ben skittles as a playful and lighthearted gift while Ben gave her chocolates as a more traditional romantic gesture."}}
{"Q": "We went to the beach today. Which event could cause We had a lot of fun building our sand castle?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) We all swam in the lake and then played in the mud for a while. (B) We used ocean water and sand for construction.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) We used ocean water and sand for construction.\nExplanation: Building a sand castle requires sand and water, and since the statement mentions going to the beach, it is more likely that they used ocean water and sand to build the castle. Swimming in the lake and playing in the mud do not necessarily relate to building a sand castle."}}
{"Q": "Anthony, 23, checked craigslist for local piano instructors. Which event could cause But who Anthony thought was her brother was really her husband?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Anthony was attracted to his new piano teacher. (B) Anthony saw it was his sister's brother.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Anthony saw it was his sister's brother.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it is a common mistake to assume that someone is a sibling based on their last name or family resemblance. It is unlikely that Anthony would mistake his piano teacher's husband for her brother if he had never met either of them before. Additionally, there is no indication in the question that Anthony was attracted to his piano teacher, making choice (A) less likely."}}
{"Q": "I bought a house with an ugly yard Which event could cause He carved the rock into a lion head and kept it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) There was a large rock in the yard. (B) I decided to tear the whole notebook up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. There was a large rock in the yard.\nExplanation: If there was a large rock in the yard, it is plausible that the previous owner or someone else may have carved it into a lion head and decided to keep it as a decorative feature in the yard. On the other hand, tearing up a notebook has no connection to the scenario of buying a house with an ugly yard."}}
{"Q": "Ric loved his dogs, and took them everywhere he went. Which event could cause He often gently dusts their ash canisters in somber reflection?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ric's dogs lived long, happy lives, but like all living things, eventually passed away. (B) Ric's cats passed away last month; he misses them so.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The statement mentions that Ric loved his dogs and took them everywhere he went, indicating a strong emotional attachment to them. The phrase \"dusts their ash canisters in somber reflection\" suggests that the dogs have passed away and their remains are being kept in ash canisters. Option A is the most plausible answer as it states that Ric's dogs lived long, happy lives but eventually passed away, which would explain why he is reflecting on their ashes. Option B is not a plausible answer as it mentions Ric's cats passing away, which is unrelated to his dogs."}}
{"Q": "Tara wanted to find a new hobby. Which event could cause She enjoyed her thriving business?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) she decided to start a children's clothes business. (B) Tara opened a can of tuna.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. She decided to start a children's clothes business.\nExplanation: Since Tara enjoyed her thriving business, it is more plausible that she would want to start a new business venture rather than randomly opening a can of tuna as a hobby. Starting a children's clothes business would also allow her to use her business skills and potentially continue her success in a new industry."}}
{"Q": "In the first police interrogation Ike was very confused. Which event could cause Ike decided to stop talking and wait until he could get a lawyer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ike said some things that could be incriminating. (B) Ike decided to confess.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Ike's confusion during the first police interrogation may have led him to say things that could be incriminating without fully understanding the consequences. Realizing this, he may have decided to stop talking and wait until he could get a lawyer to ensure that he did not accidentally incriminate himself further. Confessing would not be a plausible answer as it goes against Ike's decision to stop talking and wait for a lawyer."}}
{"Q": "Daisy was at her middle school graduation. Which event could cause She decided to forget about it, and went home?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Daisy dropped a bow on her graduation outfit. (B) she lost her hat.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Daisy dropped a bow on her graduation outfit.\nExplanation: Dropping a bow on her graduation outfit may cause Daisy to feel embarrassed or self-conscious, leading her to want to forget about the event and go home. Losing her hat may be inconvenient, but it is unlikely to be a significant enough event to cause her to leave her graduation ceremony."}}
{"Q": "Ben had an exam coming up the next day. Which event could cause The next day, Ben failed his exam?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ben decided to go to sleep early instead of studying. (B) Ben did not study.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B. Ben did not study.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Ben failing his exam was caused by not studying rather than simply deciding to go to sleep early. While getting enough rest is important for academic success, it is unlikely that one night of extra sleep would have a significant impact on Ben's ability to perform well on the exam. On the other hand, not studying at all would leave Ben unprepared and likely result in a poor grade."}}
{"Q": "My cell phone lanyard broke on Wednesday. Which event could cause My wife was able to repair the lanyard, so I did not have to buy one?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I couldn't afford to replace my lanyard. (B) I showed it to my wife.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) I showed it to my wife.\nExplanation: Since the lanyard was broken, the most plausible event that could have led to its repair is showing it to someone who could fix it. In this case, the person who fixed it was the speaker's wife. Option (A) is less likely since it assumes that the speaker couldn't afford to replace the lanyard, which is not mentioned in the given information."}}
{"Q": "Kyle had made a pair of wheels to help his injured cat move around. Which event could cause It made Kyle happy to help out two animals who needed it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He continued making wheels for other injured animals. (B) Kyle helped two more cats with the same injuries.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: If Kyle continued making wheels for other injured animals, it would show that he was motivated to help more animals in need, which would likely make him happy. Helping two more cats with the same injuries would also make him happy, but it is a more specific scenario and may not be as likely to happen. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Alice lived with her parents. Which event could cause She was put on restriction when her father caught her?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Alice did live up to her parent's rules. (B) Alice kept stealing money from her parents.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Alice kept stealing money from her parents.\nExplanation: If Alice was caught stealing money from her parents, it would be a reasonable cause for her to be put on restriction. This behavior would go against her parents' rules and would require consequences to be put in place to discourage it from happening again. On the other hand, choice (A) is too vague and could apply to many different situations, making it less likely to be the cause of Alice's punishment."}}
{"Q": "Al couldn't hear anything out of his new headphones. Which event could cause They told Al that the headphone jack was turned off?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Al called customer support. (B) The employee's complained to Al.", "R": {"text": "Answer: They told Al that the headphone jack was turned off.\nExplanation: This is the most plausible answer as it directly addresses the issue of Al not being able to hear anything out of his new headphones. It is possible that Al may have called customer support, but it is more likely that he would have first checked the headphone jack and volume settings. The employees complaining to Al also does not make sense in this context."}}
{"Q": "Jenny wanted to know why the water was red. Which event could cause Inside she found a severed human hand?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jenny went to investigate the water supply. (B) Jenny closed the bag in the water.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Jenny went to investigate the water supply.\nExplanation: If Jenny went to investigate the water supply, she would have been able to see the water and notice that it was red. This would prompt her to investigate further and potentially find the severed human hand. On the other hand, closing a bag in the water would not necessarily cause the water to turn red or lead to the discovery of a severed human hand."}}
{"Q": "Carla's old Doctor switched practices and she needed to get a new one. Which event could cause She liked her a lot?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Carla's old Doctor found a new landlord. (B) Carla's old doctor saw her on Tuesday.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Carla's old doctor switching practices and needing to find a new one is a logical reason for her to need a new doctor. The fact that she liked her old doctor a lot is not related to whether or not the doctor saw her on a specific day. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ted loves to go to the movies. Which event could cause He decides to stop watching movies?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) All the movie theaters near Ted raised their prices until Ted couldn't afford to go to the movies. (B) All of the movie theaters dropped their prices and gave away tickets to people who couldn't afford to go to the movies.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If all the movie theaters near Ted raised their prices until he couldn't afford to go to the movies, it would be a plausible reason for him to stop watching movies. On the other hand, if all the movie theaters dropped their prices and gave away tickets to people who couldn't afford to go to the movies, it would not be a reason for Ted to stop watching movies."}}
{"Q": "Melissa's boss decided to throw a holiday party. Which event could cause She was overjoyed when she got many compliments on her decorations?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Melissa's boss was responsible for decorations. (B) The boss went out and bought many decorations and decorated the office.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A)\nExplanation: If Melissa's boss was responsible for decorations, it is more likely that Melissa would receive compliments on her decorations since she would have been the one to decorate. If the boss went out and bought many decorations and decorated the office, it is less likely that Melissa would receive compliments on her decorations since she did not have a hand in the decorating process."}}
{"Q": "Kevin wanted to learn a totally new skill. Which event could cause In the end, he took up learning karate because of its intensity?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Kevin tried learning how to cook but it wasn't satisfying enough. (B) Kevin decided on learning karate.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is a more plausible answer as it suggests that Kevin tried learning a new skill but found it unsatisfying, leading him to search for a more intense activity like karate. Option B simply states that Kevin decided on learning karate without any context or reason behind his decision."}}
{"Q": "Tim was at home with his mom. Which event could cause Tim was silent for the rest of the night?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They got into an apartment. (B) Tim's Mom had a migraine.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Tim's Mom had a migraine.\nExplanation: Migraines can cause severe headaches, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is possible that Tim's mom's migraine was so severe that it caused Tim to be silent for the rest of the night out of concern for his mother's well-being. On the other hand, getting into an argument or a fight (as implied by \"getting into an apartment\") may cause tension and emotional distress, but it is less likely to result in complete silence for the rest of the night."}}
{"Q": "Kelly's mom was running a bath for her. Which event could cause By the time her mother returned the tub was overflowing with bubbles?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Her mom went to wash some dishes. (B) She forget to pour bubble bath into the water and left to get a brand new towel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Kelly's mom went to wash some dishes and got distracted, causing her to forget about the running bath. Forgetting to pour bubble bath into the water and leaving to get a brand new towel would not cause the tub to overflow with bubbles."}}
{"Q": "Carl was walking down the street. Which event could cause Carl paid for gas with it?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Carl had a wallet full of money and a full tank of gas. (B) Carl found a twenty and couldn't find who's it was.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Carl found a twenty and couldn't find who's it was.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because it suggests that Carl found unexpected money and decided to use it to pay for gas. Option (A) suggests that Carl had enough money to pay for gas already, so there would be no need for him to use a found twenty."}}
{"Q": "Jason's headphones haven't worked for many weeks. Which event could cause Jason is so happy to have a working pair of headphones?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jason took his headphones in for a repair. (B) Jason bought a new car.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Jason took his headphones in for a repair, it is more plausible that he would be happy to have a working pair of headphones again. Buying a new car would not necessarily have any impact on his headphones and would not be a likely cause for his happiness about them."}}
{"Q": "Ted was in the cafeteria on campus having lunch. Which event could cause Ted saved her life?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Ted heard gun shooting. Ted hid behind the counter. (B) Ted noticed a girl choking and gave her a sandwich.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Ted saved someone's life by noticing a girl choking and giving her a sandwich, as choking is a common occurrence during meals and can quickly become life-threatening if not addressed. On the other hand, gun shootings are rare events on college campuses and it is less likely that Ted would have been in a position to save someone's life in that situation."}}
{"Q": "Walter had a strong disdain for the immigrant policies in his country. Which event could cause Walter was successfully voted into office?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Walter decided to run of mayor. (B) He decided to try and keep things the same so he ran for office.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Walter decided to run for mayor.\nExplanation: If Walter had a strong disdain for the immigrant policies in his country, it is likely that he would want to make a change and improve the policies. Running for office, specifically for the position of mayor, would give him the power and platform to make those changes. Choosing to keep things the same and running for office would not align with his beliefs and goals."}}
{"Q": "Ever since he was little, Evan wanted a bright blue car. Which event could cause People waved at him when he drove by?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Evan bought a bright red car. (B) Evan decided to get a blue convertible.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Evan decided to get a blue convertible.\nExplanation: This event is more likely to cause people to wave at him because it fulfills his childhood dream of having a bright blue car. A convertible is also a fun and attention-grabbing car, which could also contribute to people waving at him. On the other hand, buying a bright red car may not have the same effect as it does not align with Evan's childhood dream."}}
{"Q": "My first day of high school was nerve wrecking. Which event could cause Their restless eyes, frightful shards of glass that seemed to cut me?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Everyone was staring at me. (B) I ran into a group of my friends in the hallway.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: The description of \"restless eyes\" and \"frightful shards of glass\" suggests a feeling of being scrutinized and judged, which is more likely to be caused by everyone staring at the speaker rather than running into a group of friends."}}
{"Q": "Joe was helping his dad clear the woods in the back of their yard. Which event could cause Joe laughed about the experience?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The backyard was being used for for his sister's wedding ceremony. (B) They had a good time doing summersaults together.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They had a good time doing summersaults together.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Joe would laugh about the experience of doing summersaults with his dad while clearing the woods, as it is a fun and lighthearted activity. It is unlikely that Joe would find humor in the backyard being used for his sister's wedding ceremony, as that is a significant and serious event."}}
{"Q": "Patrick was deeply interested in Irish history. Which event could cause Patrick decided that recent Irish history was too violent for him?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Patrick learned about it. (B) Patrick was bored reading the Irish history he discovered.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Patrick learned about it.\nExplanation: If Patrick was deeply interested in Irish history, it is unlikely that he would be bored reading about it. Therefore, the more plausible answer is that he learned about the violent events in recent Irish history and was disturbed by them, causing him to lose interest in studying it further."}}
{"Q": "Gina wanted to keep the stray dog she found. Which event could cause There was nothing she could say to convince her mother?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Gina took the dog and showed it to her mom. (B) Gina asked her mother, but she hates dogs.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Gina's mother hates dogs, it is unlikely that she would change her mind even if Gina showed her the dog. Therefore, option B is a more plausible event that could cause Gina's mother to refuse to let her keep the stray dog."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to gather persimmons where the trees grow wild in the woods. Which event could cause I told him he had the \"persimmon pucker.?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The fruits were sour when we ate them. (B) My friend picked some persimmons and gave some to me.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. The fruits were sour when we ate them.\nExplanation: If the persimmons were sour, it is likely that the person who ate them would experience a puckering sensation in their mouth, which could be referred to as the \"persimmon pucker.\" This is a common reaction to unripe or sour persimmons. On the other hand, simply receiving persimmons from a friend would not necessarily lead to this reaction."}}
{"Q": "Tina was sitting in her home. Which event could cause It turns out her neighbors were burning pizza next door?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tina heard the alarm of her neighbors smoke detector. (B) She quickly missed something awfully stinky.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. \nExplanation: If Tina heard the alarm of her neighbors smoke detector, it would be a clear indication that something was burning next door. On the other hand, missing something stinky could be caused by a variety of reasons and may not necessarily be linked to her neighbors burning pizza. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "My mom accused my girlfriend of stealing money from the safe. Which event could cause My girlfriend stole it since she slept with me last night?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I looked through my girlfriend's purse and found money. (B) My girlfriend was angry and left.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) My girlfriend was angry and left.\nExplanation: Just because someone slept with their partner does not mean they are incapable of stealing. However, if the girlfriend was angry and left, it could suggest that she was upset about being accused and wanted to distance herself from the situation. Additionally, finding money in her purse could have other explanations and may not necessarily indicate theft. Therefore, (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Tim was at a party Which event could cause He threw up and had to be taken home?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Tim got sick from drinking. (B) Tim started dancing the funky chicken.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Tim got sick from drinking.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Tim got sick from drinking at the party, as excessive alcohol consumption can lead to vomiting and the need to be taken home. Dancing the funky chicken, while potentially embarrassing, is not likely to cause someone to throw up and require assistance leaving the party."}}
{"Q": "Paul was a very tall man. Which event could cause All it ended up doing was hurting his back?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Paul wore a brace to support himself successfully. (B) Paul had to wash dishes in a very low sink.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) Paul had to wash dishes in a very low sink.\nExplanation: Washing dishes in a low sink would require Paul to bend over for an extended period of time, which could strain his back muscles and cause pain. Wearing a brace may provide support, but it would not necessarily prevent back pain from occurring. Therefore, option (B) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Ronald is afraid of being arrested. Which event could cause Because of prison food, Ronald decided to not break the law?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Ronald wants to go back. (B) Ronald loved eating at the best restaurants in town.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (A) Ronald wants to go back.\nExplanation: If Ronald had a negative experience with prison food, it could deter him from wanting to go back to prison. This fear of returning to prison could cause him to avoid breaking the law in the future. On the other hand, enjoying eating at the best restaurants in town would not necessarily prevent Ronald from breaking the law. Therefore, option (A) is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Amy decided to purchase new furniture for her new apartment. Which event could cause Amy decided to purchase new furniture for only the living room?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) amy saw it was cheap furniture. (B) Amy went furniture shopping and was blown away by the prices.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Amy went furniture shopping and was blown away by the prices, she may have decided to only purchase furniture for the living room as it is the most frequently used room in the apartment and she may not have enough budget to purchase furniture for the entire apartment. This is a more plausible answer than A, as the price of the furniture is a more significant factor in making a decision to purchase furniture."}}
{"Q": "I wanted to become a model. Which event could cause I finally landed a job and became a model?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) I worked hard to build my portfolio. (B) I went to art school.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. I worked hard to build my portfolio.\nExplanation: Building a strong portfolio is essential for aspiring models to showcase their skills and potential to potential employers. By working hard to create a diverse and impressive portfolio, a model can increase their chances of landing a job in the industry. While attending art school may provide valuable skills and knowledge, it is not necessarily a requirement for becoming a successful model."}}
{"Q": "Last Saturday we went to dim sum in Chinatown. Which event could cause We still enjoyed the experience and left stuffed?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Our favorite waiter was not there. (B) Our service was very slow and it took a while to get two dumplings..", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Even though the service was slow and it took a while to get two dumplings, the fact that they left stuffed indicates that they still enjoyed the experience. If their favorite waiter not being there was the cause, it would not have affected their enjoyment of the food."}}
{"Q": "The Smith's could not find their cat. Which event could cause The Smiths all cheered, and rushed to hug their cat?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) They looked all over and then it jumped out of a tree to its death. (B) They looked all over and then it jumped out of a cabinet.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) They looked all over and then it jumped out of a cabinet.\nExplanation: This event is more plausible because the cat was found alive and well, and the Smiths' reaction of cheering and hugging the cat suggests that it was a happy ending. In contrast, option (A) is unlikely as it involves the cat's death, which would not result in a joyful reaction from the Smiths."}}
{"Q": "Jake needed to pick his son up from soccer practice. Which event could cause His son resented him for it for a long time?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jake forgot and his son had to wait alone for hours at football practice. (B) Jake left late and got caught in traffic.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: Forgetting to pick up his son would be a more significant and upsetting event than simply being late due to traffic. Waiting alone for hours could cause his son to feel neglected and resentful towards Jake for a long time."}}
{"Q": "Since he was raised catholic , John would always go to church. Which event could cause They eventually got married and had the ceremony in that same church?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) John met an atheist girl he liked. (B) John met a woman at church and fell in love with her.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) John met a woman at church and fell in love with her.\nExplanation: Since John was raised Catholic and always went to church, it is more plausible that he would meet someone at church and fall in love with her. It is less likely that he would meet an atheist girl and have a Catholic wedding in the same church."}}
{"Q": "Darcy failed two classes in school. Which event could cause Soon Darcy was allowed to go out with her friends again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Darcy's parents punished her until she picked her grades up. (B) Darcy's parents kicked her out until she picked her grades up.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Darcy's parents would punish her until she picked her grades up rather than kicking her out. Kicking her out would not necessarily help her improve her grades and could potentially cause more harm than good. Punishing her until she improves her grades shows that her parents are invested in her education and want her to succeed."}}
{"Q": "Jeff noticed that his speakers are not as loud as he liked. Which event could cause Now he is very happy with his speakers?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Jeff bought a new stereo. (B) Jeff returned the speakers and bought new ones.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: If Jeff bought a new stereo, it is possible that the new stereo has more power and can drive the speakers to a higher volume, making Jeff happy with his speakers. On the other hand, returning the speakers and buying new ones may not necessarily guarantee that Jeff will be happy with the new speakers, as there could be other factors affecting the sound quality. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Samuel loved reading old science fiction stories. Which event could cause Samuel could not read?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Samuel forgot his reading glasses. (B) Samuel forget his reading shovel.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Samuel forgot his reading glasses.\nExplanation: If Samuel forgot his reading glasses, he would not be able to read the small print in the science fiction stories. Forgetting a reading shovel would not affect his ability to read."}}
{"Q": "Jenny was a singer and she was really talented. Which event could cause She declined reluctantly, and followed her hunch that it wasn't right?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) A man invited Jenny to dinner. (B) Jenny got a rejection from a label.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: If Jenny received a rejection from a label, it could cause her to feel discouraged and question her career path. She may feel like it's not the right path for her and decide to decline opportunities reluctantly. On the other hand, a man inviting her to dinner may not necessarily have a significant impact on her career decisions."}}
{"Q": "Lary was a poor coal miner. Which event could cause Lary was happy and excited?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lary enjoyed his job even though he was not good at it. (B) Larry came across a pile of coal.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Since Lary was a coal miner, coming across a pile of coal would mean that he has found a significant amount of coal, which could potentially increase his income and improve his living conditions. Therefore, it is more plausible that Lary would be happy and excited about finding a pile of coal rather than simply enjoying his job despite not being good at it."}}
{"Q": "Rex had a pitbull puppy. Which event could cause So every night Rex was left cleaning trash and water masses?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rex got into the trash when his owner was sleeping. (B) Rex's puppy liked to clean up after itself.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: It is more likely that Rex got into the trash when his owner was sleeping, as dogs are known to be curious and may explore their surroundings when left unsupervised. Additionally, pitbulls are known to have a strong sense of smell and may be attracted to the scent of food in the trash. It is less likely that Rex's puppy liked to clean up after itself, as this behavior is not typical of dogs."}}
{"Q": "Today I got a new green shirt. Which event could cause I decided to wear this shirt everyday to bring me more luck?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) so many horrible incidents happened while I wore it today. (B) My crush asked me out on a date today.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: It is more plausible that the positive experience of being asked out on a date by a crush would lead someone to want to wear the shirt again in hopes of bringing more luck. On the other hand, if many horrible incidents happened while wearing the shirt, it is unlikely that someone would want to continue wearing it."}}
{"Q": "Amber always thought she was the best tennis player on her team. Which event could cause Amber was disappointed that she lost to a new comer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) amber is tennis player so good for playing but positive negative is part of the life so one day playing bad so another new come from play. (B) She be saded against a new player.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: Amber's belief that she was the best tennis player on her team was shattered when she lost to a new comer. This event could cause her to feel disappointed and sad, as she may have been confident in her abilities and did not expect to lose to someone new. It is a plausible answer as it reflects the emotional impact of losing to a new player. Option (A) is not a coherent sentence and does not provide a clear explanation for Amber's disappointment."}}
{"Q": "Tim is part of the school soccer team. Which event could cause Because of his good performance they won the game?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) He failed the team on many occasions. (B) He led the team on many occasions.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) He led the team on many occasions.\nExplanation: If Tim led the team on many occasions, it means he played a significant role in the team's success. His good performance would have contributed to the team's victory, making it a plausible event that could have caused them to win the game. On the other hand, if he failed the team on many occasions, it is unlikely that his good performance alone would have been enough to secure a win."}}
{"Q": "Sal asked her friends over for a dinner party. Which event could cause Sal and her friends had a great time at their dinner party?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sal's friend came with more food and games. (B) Sal had to cancel because she had to work.", "R": {"text": "Answer: Sal's friend came with more food and games.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because having more food and games can add to the enjoyment of the dinner party. It provides more options for entertainment and can create a more festive atmosphere. On the other hand, canceling the party due to work would not allow for any party to happen at all, let alone a great one."}}
{"Q": "Tim's girlfriend Gina starts seeing a psychologist. Which event could cause Gina responds to his ultimatum by dumping him?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) Tim wanted Gina to do better at her job. (B) Tim said you need to stop seeing the psycologist or him.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: Tim giving Gina an ultimatum to choose between him or seeing a psychologist is a clear sign of controlling behavior and lack of support for her mental health. This could cause Gina to feel unsupported and disrespected, leading her to end the relationship. On the other hand, Tim wanting Gina to do better at her job may be a concern, but it is not a significant enough issue to cause a breakup."}}
{"Q": "Samuel loved reading old science fiction stories. Which event could cause He loved it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) He read the Star Wars extended universe material. (B) Samuel was gifted a science text book.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: The fact that Samuel loved reading old science fiction stories suggests that he has a pre-existing interest in the genre. Option A, which mentions the Star Wars extended universe material, is more plausible as it is also a science fiction story and could have further fueled Samuel's interest in the genre. Option B, which mentions a science textbook, is less likely to have caused Samuel's love for science fiction stories as textbooks are typically more factual and less imaginative."}}
{"Q": "Clara used to be a very active person. Which event could cause Clara gave up and never got out of bed again?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Clara fell down one day in the gym and broke her leg. (B) Clara developed an illness which caused her to exercise a lot.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B)\nExplanation: If Clara developed an illness that required her to exercise a lot, it is possible that she became exhausted and lost motivation to continue being active. On the other hand, breaking a leg may be a setback, but it is unlikely to cause someone to give up on physical activity altogether."}}
{"Q": "My baby has a favorite blanket. Which event could cause I better go to the store and get another one?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) My adult started teething though and ruined the blanket. (B) I am going to need to wash the blanket soon.", "R": {"text": "Answer: B\nExplanation: It is more likely that the baby's favorite blanket will need to be washed soon, as babies tend to drool, spit up, and have diaper leaks. Having a backup blanket on hand will ensure that the baby is not without their favorite comfort item while the original is being washed. While it is possible for an adult to accidentally damage the blanket, it is less likely than the need for washing."}}
{"Q": "Rodolfo was a reindeer herder. Which event could cause Then he took off into the skies with his reindeer?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Rodolfo trained to be Santa's apprentice. (B) Rodolfo rounded us all his sheep.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Rodolfo trained to be Santa's apprentice.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Rodolfo took off into the skies with his reindeer because he was training to be Santa's apprentice, as Santa is known for using reindeer to deliver presents on Christmas Eve. On the other hand, rounding up sheep does not typically involve flying reindeer."}}
{"Q": "Yesterday Lauren decided to go for a walk in the woods. Which event could cause Lauren shouted and soon her dad came running to rescue her?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Lauren found a snake on the trail. (B) Lauren fell and twisted her tongue.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A. Lauren found a snake on the trail.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Lauren would shout and need rescue if she encountered a snake, which could potentially be dangerous or venomous. Twisting her tongue, while painful, would not necessarily require immediate rescue from her dad."}}
{"Q": "Marty saw the snow was falling down hard outside. Which event could cause When he took his gloves off, his ring went flying into the snow?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) In his excitement to touch the snow he ran outside and ripped his gloves off without thinking. (B) Marty put on gloves to stay inside.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it suggests that Marty was excited and acted impulsively, which could lead to him ripping off his gloves without thinking. This sudden movement could cause his ring to slip off and go flying into the snow. Option B does not provide a clear reason for why Marty would take his gloves off inside, and it seems unlikely that he would lose his ring in this scenario."}}
{"Q": "Jan checked into a hotel after a long business workshop. Which event could cause Then Jan saw the pot empty by the maker and coffee pooling around it?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Jan started the coffee machine and jumped into the shower. (B) Jan wanted to get some coffee in her room, but the machine didn't look like it was working.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more likely that Jan started the coffee machine and then went to take a shower, leaving the machine unattended and causing the pot to overflow. Option B suggests that Jan didn't even try to use the machine, making it less likely that she would notice the empty pot and coffee spill."}}
{"Q": "Terence took his brothers boomerang and threw it as hard as he could. Which event could cause Terence didn't know that boomerang's returned to the thrower?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Terrence ended up with a black eye. (B) He bragged about the strength of his throw to his brother, only for his brother to suddenly hit him in the face.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A.\nExplanation: It is more plausible that Terence didn't know that boomerangs return to the thrower and ended up with a black eye because he didn't move out of the way in time. It is less likely that his brother would suddenly hit him in the face just because Terence bragged about his throw."}}
{"Q": "I was hanging out at night alone. Which event could cause We hung out and ate lasagna and watched tv?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I was then with my sister. (B) My friend surprised me by showing up to hang out.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) My friend surprised me by showing up to hang out.\nExplanation: This option is more plausible because it explains how someone else joined the narrator for the evening. If the narrator was alone and then suddenly with their sister, it would have been mentioned earlier. However, a friend surprising them by showing up is a common occurrence and would explain how they ended up hanging out and eating lasagna together."}}
{"Q": "Last year I was really full of energy after class one day. Which event could cause They thought it was funny and we all laughed together?", "A": "(B)", "O": "(A) I told a really scary story to my friends. (B) My friend told us a joke.", "R": {"text": "Answer: (B) My friend told us a joke.\nExplanation: It is more likely that a joke would cause laughter and a fun atmosphere than a scary story. Additionally, the fact that \"they thought it was funny\" suggests that someone else was responsible for the humor, rather than the speaker themselves. Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible answer."}}
{"Q": "Sam was hiking in the forest. Which event could cause Soon he had found his way back to camp?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) Sam became lost, but had brought his map and compass. (B) At no point did Sam get lost.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Choice A is the more plausible answer because it presents a situation where Sam could have become lost, but was prepared with a map and compass to find his way back to camp. Choice B states that Sam never got lost, which contradicts the statement that he eventually found his way back to camp."}}
{"Q": "Kelly loved going to the lake. Which event could cause Kelly then was upset?", "A": "(A)", "O": "(A) The car they were taking to the lake caught fire, and they had to spend the day making police, fire and insurance reports. (B) Kelly found out a company dumped toxic waste in the reservoir.", "R": {"text": "Answer: A\nExplanation: Option A is more plausible because it directly affects Kelly's plans to go to the lake and causes her to be upset. Option B is a serious issue, but it does not necessarily have a direct impact on Kelly's immediate plans or enjoyment of the lake."}}
